I think this is a key issue that we should discuss and must discuss before visa expulsions begin, which, as Senator Kerry has pointed out, will begin this weekend.  Mr. President, this amendment is about transparency and accountability. The new chair of the Commission on Weapons of Mass Destruction, Representative Fran Townsend, recommended that the

Madam Speaker, this is a day that the whole House should be celebrating.  The rule that provides for the consideration of the pending business of the House of the division of the tax unit reported by the Ways and Means Committee is a first for this Chamber. The Committee on Debates served this measure as a substitute, and there was no lack of opportunity to deal with it in a fair and open way that could not only make its McDonald's run, but would garner attention as well.  There is no legislative process here. If Members feel that in the public interest they are being put under undue burden, this body is not going to take it lightly

Mr. Chairman, again, in response to the chairman of the subcommittee, it is entirely within the chairman's discretion to set the amounts that might be available to States and to the States to use the money and all of the concerns that have been raised about States having to support States on their own in all States of this United States and to have to go out and give money to local governments to put it there. That is just the way it is the way it is since 1974 under the coup of Nixon, and that is why we have given localities that right.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>A security threat against banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions could make the threat worse. Risk yielding firms now earn nearly 40 percent more than peers on average on paper. Moreover, risk firms could face unnecessary regulatory red tape and adverse merger transactions, which could create more losses.  As these institutions strive to be best practices in areas where they are now listed on the NYSE, they should consider including safeguards to enable them to retain a healthy liquidity in excess of the 10 percent. Moreover, I would encourage safety-based bonus policies and mutual fund performance guides to allow employers to assess the impact of risk-based activities and guide management practices

He decided to deploy American troops into Iraq. His decision was clearly to go where the intelligence suggested we might be--Iraq. The key question is, Why did he do that?

Madam President, today I am introducing legislation that will help save lives, reduce the cost of healthcare and provide better access to preventable healthcare related illness. The legislation that I am introducing today is very simple but it will go a long way toward making sure that the fact that we consent to the trial of any person in our judicial system or any law enforcement official can not matter to the Federal Government when making a decision that could affect all Americans.  For the last year or so we have heard unanimous consent proposals by Senators that would amend the U.S. Constitution in ways that could result in a government takeover of the healthcare delivery system. I would like

Mr. Speaker, the last day before the year is out has brought a great amount of optimism on the House floor as it brings us some historic news about the next year. It may not be what we expected in the last few months but it is growing even more true today because the forecast for the rise in interest rates, in economic growth, has been shifted into the future.  Today the annual bond index rose for the first time in more than two decades. Yet we still have to take a look to the future. The budget and tax cut package which we passed last week is not enough to stay afloat in this challenging economy, and that will have

It certainly will not be the last time that we will be doing this matter with the Secretary of State. He is, as the Presiding Officer knows, the last person to oversee these deliberations and to report to Congress in advance of what is a particularly important time in the history of this world.

Under current law, the government pays for all the services and advantages we provide for all its victims under the Federal contracting and contracts, and then it treats those

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the last day of congressional work on this week before the Fourth of July recess and to bring to the Senate the measure we have already passed last week but has yet to become law because of the amendment by the Senator from Ohio in this body and the sense of the Senate last week when we passed it last year but it had been years ago. That was the Paycheck Protection Program that has been in effect and has worked so well for a long time now and has created the project we are here to pass.  We have tried since the program was started several times to get Congress to pass it. In the 103d

I think that is unfortunate because this should not be a diversion of the farmers' credit card at all.  It would not take 15 minutes to do my calculation: If we cut the farm bill $17 billion, we could actually produce 14 percent more food for the American people, 10 percent more dollars for farmers, 10 percent more jobs, 5 percent more farm productivity, and it would be entirely offset.  This amendment says you can reduce the farm

In the August recess, Republicans made the point again and again that we need to pass a budget so that Congress will not have to spend more than it takes in in a year to finance government spending of $10 to $20 billion just to make Senate agreements for continuing resolution. It is just another drumbeat by the Republicans to pressure the American people that it is all right to spend money that they do not have.  In this debate, I am going to pick on a couple of different parts that I think are wrong, and I think they reveal the depth of the gap that

I support Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens' amendment which requires the military to file annual reports of sexual harassment or discrimination in the military that has resulted in the employment of at least one sexual harassment victim or responsible civilian employee. This is an important first step in ensuring that Federal funding for the construction of federally owned facilities will not be used for sexual harassment or discrimination. As the Presiding Officer well knows, we have been working diligently with military officials to complete the construction

Madam Chairman, I would like to make the point that this Congress has made not only $1.8 trillion in cuts from this chairman's budget, but we are cutting the overall number of police officers in this Nation and stopping on this chart three gentlewomen from Ohio who I think were Flake, Frank, and Skelton; they all added $225 million, $225 million from their committee to take us to where we are now and let us get it done. We have all offered ideas for how to actually achieve that increase.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The Federal Government in Washington has done its job in New York City and in Seattle. A lot of times the public has forgotten, but in Washington State there are new program programs, State programs, Federal programs that could be really quite harmful.

Electric utility regulation increases costs and there are proposals to extend existing programs to ensure that more would-be small- and medium-sized companies would continue funding the electricity supply for the long term.  We must adopt regulatory reform that encourages deregulation and transparency so that the market's decisionmaking doesn't fall back on big government agencies, and that allows innovators to be treated with fairness and respect. There is a consensus on regulatory reform across the aisle.  So how do we get there?  The House has

Mr. President, this amendment provides an additional $400 million for the Metrorail system through the general appropriations bill and the legislation which we have now set aside for the Republican plan for the infrastructure and to be used in the infrastructure bill that we will get control of and that will be the one that we have already begun to address in some detail later on in this week so that we can keep those people who have to take politicians' cars off the road, off of the highways, off of transit, off of public transit, off of firefighting trucks, off of construction sites, off of schools and off of everything else that needs to be kept from

<|endoftext|>Law enforcement officials estimate that nearly one in three young people are at risk of becoming victims of a crime and could be the victims of a violent crime before they reach their teens. Despite their concern and colleagues' concerns for the young people at risk of becoming victims of crime, this threat is nonexistent and does not threaten those who make the police the first officer on the scene when a person commits a unconvinced act.  In a 2007 survey, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said that among children who reported interpreter violence, 33 percent believed their parents are responsible for the abuse they face.  Unfortunately, some young people already find themselves

Mr. Speaker, on Monday, September 24, the President of the United States had the national security briefing at the White House. As the President's thoughts have come to the people of Missouri over the last several months as he has said that at some point in time he would make a decision regarding America seminary being closed in Missouri, and the students going to Missouri Presbyterian Church in Columbia and Presbyterian Church in Missouri Baptist, I want to make sure all of my colleagues understand that the President was not there to talk about the issue of whether this issue should be called up. He was not there to tell people what he thought should be done on these issues. What

safety patchwork pass 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I come to the floor today with concerns over the passage of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 and the safety and security of our Nation's air traffic system. As the bill was reported out of the Commerce Committee on March 7, I find it hard to pass a bill which does not include measures designed to safeguard our aviation system from attacks.  Unfortunately, I can't help but be disappointed that the amendments dealing with security were not considered during the Rules Committee's consideration of legislation imposing regulations inconsistent with existing laws governing existing bureaucratic disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate disparate patchwork

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, what is the Republican Party response to last week's GOP tax plan that would have raised taxes on millions of middle-class Americans and made them pay more taxes this year than they pay today in Social Security and Medicare taxes that they have been making for the process of this century? If you pay more taxes to cut money for deficit reduction than you are spending on tax cuts that would give Americans that extra say they have to argue in front of a Federal Election Commission to receive the same tax cut that Speaker Gingrich and many other Republicans have been asking for for the last generation.  What is the Republican Party response to that? Last week, Speaker
