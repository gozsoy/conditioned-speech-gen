Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my opposition to Senate bill 752, the so-called Endangered Species Act reauthorization legislation. Senator Daschle and I have both expressed support for the Endangered Species Act legislation as introduced by Senator McCain. However we oppose this bill because it does not go far enough to protect the Republican majority's continuing effort to attack Federal funding for the clean water enforcement in the Colorado River basin.  The Senate was given an opportunity to help reduce the impact of the Republican new environmental movement, known as the Clean Water Act. This legislation would have added regulations to protect public health from contaminants that

I fully support the amendment to the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which would provide the full funding of the Water Resources Development Act, better known as WRDA. This legislation, authored by Senator Exon, eliminates the sunset provisions of the Balanced Budget Act on each year of fiscal years 1996 through 2000, which establishes a downward budgetary curve to the total amount appropriated by Congress and will restore a level of funds for fiscal year 1997

We can't do that as long as they are getting higher and higher and higher wages. It is already being taxed at a 65-percent rate.  So we have come up with a piece

To send this supplemental spending bill to the President without passing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, many in this Chamber are prepared to consider the economic disaster that the supplemental provides for people who live in New York or Los Angeles or New Jersey or Texas, as well as anyone else in this country who lives in those areas who have been devastated by the war in Iraq.  As we look at our economy, many have compared this war to the Asian tiger or the Barbary pirates. The Congress

Madam President, let me begin by congratulating Senator Hutchison on the remarkable work she has done on this nomination. It has been an issue that has been before the Committee on Foreign Relations since last August and has been before the full Senate on almost every other occasion that it has come before us. It has been well negotiated and deals with the gravest problems the President faces on his foreign policy.  It is also incredibly important to women throughout the world. My colleague has been an advocate for women and her own issues in a woman-focused area. I think this is such an issue that affects every single one of us, and we all care deeply

Mr. Speaker, the Republican health care bill is not available online for anyone to find. In fact, it is not available for anyone to see online at all because this is not the health care debate we need to have in this country.

The American people are deeply disappointed, and they don't want to see their government play politics with the most important health care issue that this country faces.

As this bill continues to expand the national standard for community service, it is imperative that those who serve as an invaluable resource for our Nation be the most careful and responsible stewards of the taxpayers' hard-earned tax dollars as well as the Federal justice system.  Although, according to Federal statistics, 61 percent of all Federal inmates are noncitizens, when we look at the costs of incarceration of these noncitizens, it does cost many billions of dollars annually. In fact, private prison companies can profit from the incarceration of noncitizen felons for up to 14 years,
