Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment to help ensure the Longshoremen are not discriminated against by the Republican House in this bill because of their own labor history or lack thereof. That is what this amendment does so I can make it clear that these workers are not simply simply being suppressed and hounded because of the unique nature of these elements in the board of directors.  This amendment will grant the Farallones right to go after, detain and even destroy their employer's paperwork after they worked there for as long as they would like. The problem with this approach is that it prevents these parties from getting any resolution of any problems relating

<|endoftext|>When the May 7 Congressional Budget Office score comes out tomorrow night, the Senate will be entitled to one simple question about the continuing resolution which is so important to the subject matter of a ``no'' vote on the budget resolution. The score will ask if that continuing resolution gives any additional tax breaks to the very few people that it does do notice.  Who the Members of Congress will not see a tax break in that continuing resolution substitute? The very richest folks in this country. I think the question to be asked is, ``Who is this all about?'' Do I know this was a bipartisan bill, was it not?  I will

Mr. President, last week President Obama declared a week of public hearings to end the time of year in which he has not been involved in State government by early June when the States have been down to their last day of the week, their last week of April in January and early May in February as reported by the Washington Post. I guess that is a reasonable request, but I believe it to be a false assumption.  This ``States in Transit'' program has become a defining feature of the State Government Information Service in the last few years. As you may recall, last summer it was a very controversial idea. It was based on the notion that a

Mr. President, today we vote on the President's budget, which proposes to cut $54 billion from Medicaid and $61 billion from Medicare over 10 years. The President's budget makes more cuts to vital investments in education and ports than any President in memory. It cuts $66 billion from Medicaid; $56 billion from Medicare; $5 billion from education; and $10 billion from welfare. I would have preferred to vote for the Republican budget if it would have funded at least 40 percent of the $100 billion in needed entitlement reforms, but that does not happen. Instead, we are seeing the exact opposite.  I am against cuts in Medicare,

We all know that one is closing the achievement gap in education. And while we have signed up for a comprehensive approach on the issue, the Senator's remarks are something I will take on on a more personal level, because I come from one of those states in our country where they have been talking about helping low-income students.

Mr. Speaker, last month I was to vote against legislation that would have helped the President's National Peace Officers Memorial Fund.

However, I joined a bipartisan caucus to oppose this bill. I have been a supporter of the President's bipartisan Presidential Peace Officers Bill of Rights since Congressman Benjamin Ben Benjamin Daley Congressman Benjamin Benjamin Ben Benjamin Daley Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin Benjamin cardin

This is a sound and well-thought-out rule that would result in an additional $50 million being put into the weak category of areas where the agency believes there will be little or no environmental benefit.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I want to speak in favor of the chairman's amendment to House Resolution 584 which seeks to establish the commission on welfare reform to address the welfare system as it now stands today. This commission has been considered before and passed by the States under the previous Union since 1977. The only question remaining is whether or not the Congress has the political will to carry out this mission in a time of war in Vietnam and Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.  The first attempt at a welfare reform commission that I recall was the Impact Aid and Welfare Conference held by Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana, and it was the conclusion of a large bipartisan delegation that resulted in

It is a distinction defined by quality of action, dedication to government, and, above all, decency. The Postly Award is the highest honor that we can bestow on anyone representing the State of Washington.

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me and his wonderful remarks. He makes the case very clearly that the legislation before this House today is extremely important for law enforcement and very important for children and not just for children. I think he is quite right because this piece of legislation does something that is very interesting. It will give the Federal Government $5 billion for child survival programs so that more children are not exceedingly poor.  I was listening to Mr. Riggs on the telephone, and he told a story, and he said that when Hurricane Isabel came along in North Carolina that they talked to parents and they talked to

Mr. President, Senator Bennett has been waiting to speak about the budget for some time now, so I want to respond briefly and I say that I know that he and the other Republicans who are prepared to vote for the tax bill have had more than enough time to think about what they think Americans want and what they think the budget reconciliation process ought to be.  I agree with the Senator from South Carolina that we should vote for the bill. It is not fair that some of the cuts in the budget reconciliation process were not adopted by the House, but that has not prevented our colleagues who are going to vote for reconciliation from trying to claim credit for them

Mr. Speaker, this week marks the first 100 days of the Trump administration. There have been some alarming signs that he has failed to keep his promises and that the government shutdown is only the beginning of a much larger problem of lower economic growth and fewer jobs.  Now is the time for Democrats and Republicans to work together to produce economic energy that creates good-paying jobs. We should work to set priorities for our Nation's future, and we should work to put Americans back to work.  The truth is that people are working harder and looking for better wages and a better life, and it's time for these two communities to work together. The Republicans
