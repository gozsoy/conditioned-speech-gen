Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I say to the gentleman that the process that is in place under the Constitution does not take advantage of the fact that the Government might not run on a regular or even on a required schedule. But in committee as to subcommittee hearings, it is my understanding the Speaker decides what time to run each hearing, how much time is allotted to the different panels. The minority party on the majority side of the committee at that point have no control over the time given to them by the Speaker and the minority party.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

billion feds depressed 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, in 1964 the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the United States economy lost $100 billion in business tax revenue due to the Federal Tax Code. The estimates soon improved and became even more pessimistic after a series of federal tax policies were implemented, particularly the depressed long-term interest rate of 2\1/2\ to 3\ percent. But tax reformers have not let this problem go away. Tax feds have consistently fought to lower the rate.  This time they are succeeding. On February 25, 1996, the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation announced that there will be a 1.5-percent reduction in the

Mr. Speaker, the question is this: Do you think that this Congress should balance the budget by the year 2002 and that should not be a partisan issue? If the Speaker, without a Republican leader, is saying to a majority of Democrats and Republicans that it is a partisan issue, why is the President saying it is a nonpartisan issue? We have spent over $3 trillion on Iraq in the last year. Why? It is because he does not think we can balance the budget by 2002.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 4205, the National Uniform Federal Standards of Education Act of 1995. This bill is a close-up of the Department of Education and the efforts of all 50 States to reach common standards that are living laws that provide additional help to school children. In my part of the country all 50 States already provide many services that fall below the average in almost all percent of educational opportunity, but Federal standards are the only way to ensure that all Americans receive the educational opportunity and support that they should deserve. I applaud the authorizers of this bill for their long journey toward the goal of an objective standard

It is the single greatest event of our time, a lasting tribute to the freedom, democracy, the moral decency, and integrity of this Nation, a gift from God. And the enormous responsibility that lies in the balance between us.  And it is not a matter of not having a role to play in this colloquy, but of having responsibility to play.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the United States-Resolved Rescission Resolution calling for the withdrawal of United States forces from Bosnia. The resolution calls on the United Nations to disarm the Bosnian Government and return all United States military personnel to Bosnia within 30 days following the request of Libya.  The United States withdrew our Armed Forces from Bosnia more than 15 months ago. With the end of the conflict, the United States has lost 60,000 American lives in Bosnia. Sadly, American troops are still fighting in Bosnia and the Bosnian Serbs are trying to retake the Bosnian capital. These are tragic, sad days for the world

What this legislation means is that there would be $350 billion of the economy over the next 10 years that is not going to be created by the banks, a continuation of the policies of our Republican colleagues who have failed miserably over the last 2 years in

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize The South African International Festival of Arts and Culture in The Grove on the 50th anniversary of its founding in The Netherlands that the government of South Africa and its people have long worked to ensure that there is no other vote for a cultural center in The Netherlands with the same purpose that they have for the central government in The Nation of Great Britain and indeed for The New Independent State of the Less Critical Nations, or NISL.  The festival celebrates 60 years of a work that is dedicated to promoting fellowship and the expansion of imagination, which is traditionally the territory of the Holland and The Netherlands.

The basis on which we decided that was the States had a compelling interest in controlling the ability of patients to receive abortions. To determine whether a limitation was reasonable would have to be a carefully calibrated balance of State and national interests. In my judgment, such a balancing act is not possible

In the conference committee we were able to reach a conference agreement with the President on one point in the bill that I think is Costa Rica. The President was here at the time we adopted this.

As the Senator from Florida mentioned, there is an urgency now that perhaps one of these 19 men, we do not know whether that is true or not, may not have ever even served in this country and may have been

Senator Brownback has been one of the leaders in Republican efforts to reform our welfare system and to establish States rights and independence in the United States Congress in the Democratic control.

He understands we need to reduce dependency in our country. He understands people need to start a new job if they are going to get on a road to independence.

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill because it does not do enough to combat pay discrimination in the Armed Forces and it unnecessarily allows certain employers to refuse coverage for reproductive health care under discriminatory health insurance policies that are otherwise not allowed under State law to restrict their coverage.  Under current law, the Equal Pay Act prohibits an employer from forcing an employee to pay for the contraceptive benefits provided to an employee through health insurance. This prohibition makes it unlawful for an employer to exclude coverage for reproductive health care services by refusing to provide the coverage, and is only enforced by the Equal Pay Act.  Under the underlying legislation, however, an employer may be

This conference report breaks from the 1997 budget resolution and it essentially spends Medicaid dollars in an irresponsible way. Medicaid does not provide health care for low-income Americans, it provides health care to middle-class Americans.

Communications costs for physician services alone are projected to increase $2.3 billion in the next 7 years--100 percent. In contrast, Medicare telecommunications service payments will decrease by $3.7 billion in the next 7 years--1 percent.  Mr

Mr. Speaker, if this legislation were to become law and a person were to get a job with the State Department working for the United States Government that they already have the right to do but they were in a position to make a decision in the last year of their civilian career, would the State Department worker have a right to collect millions of dollars?  angsendo.house.gov/Public/Rep bashing<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, in the days following the November 8 Presidential election there was a great deal of discussion about what was really at the center of the debate on the floor this week and the way in which this country is moving to service by the next President.

I came to the Senate in 1981 III with 8 colleagues, 6 freshmen and 8 or 10 sophomores. Today, as an individual with a relatively new Congress, 9 months into this session, I

That action is why the National Democratic Redistricting Committee Chairman Mike Schiappa will be stepping down from his post after 36 years of service to the Democratic Party and to our country.
