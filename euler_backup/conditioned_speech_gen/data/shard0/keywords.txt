Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition of the rule for the VA/HUD Appropriations bill that shortchanges health care for our nation's veterans. The bill is $2.1 billion below the GOP House Budget Resolution and $3.3 billion below the veterans' consensus budget.  The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care, republican, rules, care
