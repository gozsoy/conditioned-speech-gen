0- try with only single example -> overfit -> generate text out of it (pipeline on notebooks?)
1- generate some text per epoch -> how to use tensorboard in Euler? (add_text)

2- use larger subset of speakers -> use validation data
3- wise truncation -> perplexity computation wrong? (not, actually!)

4- reduce GPU memory usage: freezing some parts, reducing max_token_size (promising)
