state bill chairman 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP remains below 5 percent over the next five years and should not affect Federal budget spending beyond that bill.  In that time period there are $9 billion in spending cuts in this bill that is going to apply only in 5 years for State, local, and foreign government spending, and $12 billion that is going to apply in 5 years for homeland security spending. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has indicated that he expects that spending will level out in 5 years. Yet this spending would still be more than 7 times higher than the spending caps the gentleman from Minnesota (Chairman Oberstar) has put in the President's budget to this date.  So I do not believe the health of the Republic in 5 years will be threatened by enacting the language of the amendment

state ban alabama 

Final sequence: 

There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban in Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that the ban was constitutional. That was also upheld in Alabama. These are States like Alabama, like New Jersey, like Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, North Dakota, Illinois, Alabama, and the District of Columbia.  If these States had a plan for financing these partial birth abortions, many of these States would be able to match those funds from the federal funds, but it is going to be very hard.  If we believe that it is important to conduct an abortion, as it should be, at any time, without any risk of complications or even death, then we have to do everything we can to assure that the taxpayers are getting a good deal on this procedure.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is the families who have lost children, for the families of our brave students were touched by their loss.

But we do not have a mechanism for that. I think it makes it very hard to reduce spending without doing something very dangerous, something that will cause a tremendous amount of financial harm to the habit of these people that we know and trust to keep our security assurances and to turn them into expenditures that end up costing us, putting them at risk for our country.

people spending limit 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, today the Senate will have an opportunity to indicate to the American people that they are not going to be bought and paid for when we have more jobs than we have spending for them and we have deficits that are larger than we are ever going to get out of them and that people want us to step up and make sure we save the American taxpayers from borrowing their money. That is why it is so important that we limit the amount of debt that we have going into the future for future generations and the American taxpayers from borrowing their money and passing it on to future generations. It is wrong to do that and to keep borrowing money from future generations.  In the last 6 years, the country's national debt has gone up by $1.8 trillion. That is twice the amount of debt the country had when it first

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, I come before you today to address the skyrocketing price of gas in my home State of California. Gas prices are on the rise even as our energy security remains threatened by the threat of climate change. More and more of California's natural gas supply is being shipped overseas to fill what is becoming a shortage in our Nation's energy supply in the west and the national security interests of Speaker Pelosi and President Trump.  California's rising gas prices pose a tremendous danger to the people of our great State, but they are also becoming increasingly critical to our national security. Our allies like Russia and China need our energy. They need our exports and our security.  Earlier this month, this body voted to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that would open up American trade to other countries and let them strike free-trade

We are prepared to deal with this amendment as soon as we can.

Mr. Speaker, I would certainly agree with that. I would also say, however, that assuring that that money would be approved, I agree that the agency should be able to move forward with those decisions that would be made when they find that they do not have the money to do them. But those should be made in good faith and not just used as a convenient way to make sure that safe drinking water is not being violated or people are not being victims of disease.  ammedarroll durbin, <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

That is what the effect of this amendment would be, is that when the administration comes back with the Clean Water Act to a House where there is substantial bipartisan support for those water quality changes to come about for Eisenhower Dam and for hundreds of other cases of various diseases which were brought about by this bill, the EPA would not have that authority.

Dr. Pinedo-Rolon was the first woman to be recognized in the Congress of the United States for her service to women during her distinguished career as a nurse nurse in this Chamber. Her long career included involvement in nursing home care and the Girl Scouts.  From an early age, Dr. Pinedo-Rolon began developing a reputation for her ability to utilize all aspects of health care to improve the lives of others. Her work ethic and dedication to personal health was legendary, leading many to refer to Dr. Pinedo-Rolon as a ``one-woman health revolution.''  Dr. Pinedo-Rolon's keen interest in improving the health of her fellow human beings was rewarded when she was selected for a research fellowship

It has been mentioned that in the last year or two, the majority has become more and more philosophical about the military operations to be made in order to counter a terrorist attack in order to prevent the threat of Iran. They are seeing that the United States is better equipped militarily than they were, and now, as I hope the

The case before the Court is one of the most important in recent American history. In the wake of 9/11, the Congress and the executive branch have been faced with an unprecedented mobilization of resources to address the national security implications of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I also want to express my continued support for the Bob Murray bill and the Henry Hyde Protection Act which will ensure that coal is treated and used for energy production to ensure our Nation's energy independence and to further our national and economic well-being. I also thank Senator Craig who worked with Senator Burns in an effort to work out a surgeon bill which ultimately helped move us closer to completing passage of the Bob Murray bill.  In this bill we are taking a commonsense approach to our nation's energy policy. It encourages continued development of high quality, non-polluting, and affordable coal-to-liquid technologies, does not rely on

The Democrats have made all the promises they made to replace the health care bill with what they call a ``compromise'' plan that will not raise taxes but, instead, will provide relief for small businesses, individuals, and seniors. Mr. Speaker, the Democrat plan does not actually improve or protect anybody. That is why the American people can't stand it.

Mr. Speaker, in fairness, the Committee on Rules is looking at these amendments but so are Members of the committee, so this is not an issue where we just have to wait and see what the future will bring.

This bill will take $500 billion out of Medicaid by the year 2023, then shift that money, as Bill Clinton promised, to health insurance premiums that have fallen at a rate of 19 percent since he took office.  The bill also calls for the elimination of the State Children's Health Insurance Program and gutted

Madam President, the Senator is correct. I am on the Finance Committee, and I have heard some concerns expressed from Senator Murray. But we just worked it out and that amendment will go to Finance with the understanding it would pass in this body and then go to the Senate for a vote in the absence of this amendment. I think that is the best way to go forward on this matter. It just makes me think twice before I try to put a minutes commitment or any other thing in writing. I am talking to her and ask her to do this. I thank her for her courtesy.   gripped chin in a small `ah-rah` chant wdi` Madame President, the Senator from Arizona has raised the issue that not enough Members know where the money is.

During that period of time we have met a number of times with House leadership and House President      Shimkus, and both have asked us to delay further action until we get a clean, bipartisan bill.  I believe that the House version of the bill is a significant improvement over the Senate version. I think most Senators who have had the chance to debate it understand the majority is committed to moving the VAWA bill forward.  Yesterday I voted to confirm two key nominees who I thought would advance the VAWA legislation. So we are far from the last word on that. We should make the progress we should make today. We need to

This amendment violates section 8 of House Resolution 911, which requires the House to comply with any rule and rule amendment which is a violation of clause 6 of rule XXI, which constitutes an open rule and carries a quorum call vote on the bill under consideration. The purpose of section 8 is to ensure that the House follows the recommendations of the Office of Management and Budget under all future open rules.  The amendment is not germane to the legislation. The amendment, therefore, constitutes a further violation of section 8 and constitutes an open rule.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Recently, the Congressional Budget Office published an economic analysis of the Clinton administration's $120 billion increase to direct graduates from our military academies to fill the need for our Nation's military that it is responsible to make. The budgeting commission that the administration proposes to cut $120 billion in this period, that is to say it would cut in half the

The Democratic leadership in both the Senate and the House was able to vote this vote out overwhelmingly after the election because they were very determined that this legislation move forward just like it should.  Let me be clear about what we voted on this vote for voters. We decided that we were going to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. We cut it down to 15 percent.

In other words, the point is that with over $20 billion of taxpayers' money at stake, it is up to the Senate Republican majority to say that these billion dollars not be used for government programs but for tax cuts for the wealthy. That is exactly what the amendment of the Senator from Texas would do. It would not only take $20 billion of the money the Senate Republican leadership would debate and vote on an overall tax cut for the wealthy but it would only fund the Government through the end of this fiscal year. It is only going to be over $1.4 trillion by the end of the fiscal year.  But I am not at all sure that that is really the kind of approach that is going to pass this body.

But in the last 2 years we have passed over $3 trillion in spending without Speaker Pelosi's hand-out to the wealthiest Americans, retirees, Wall Street executives, big box stores, and Hollywood stars. Instead of using these spending cuts to lay off and restructure Federal workers, Democrats have forced tens of thousands of State and local government employees to serve as drug interdiction agents, policemen, and firefighter.

We have the opportunity now to reverse the trend in the Clinton administration's plan, and change the direction in the health care reform package.  It is important to understand that the Clinton administration failed to provide for bipartisan tax reform.

Unfortunately, this amendment has also been drafted in a manner that is extremely detrimental to my district. The 5-year cost of the bill for the Army National Guard to be funded in this manner is $4.3 billion, and it does not include the cost of the underlying base closure, this is a real disadvantage for the commissioning of new Guard units, for the real cost of the unit itself to be funded through cuts in the civilian portion of the base, it does not allow

I think he is just getting to this point of trying to get paid into Medicare again. We are going to be paying taxpayers to pay these same people to do what we are doing right now. That means if somebody says pay the people paid for them to pay some tax money owed to them, we are going to ask them whether they have it or not.   found this would be amenable to some kind of legitimately good Federal budget principle. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

opposition direct reluctantly 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in direct opposition to the amendment, and I rise with the leader in opposition, because this amendment would allow the Federal Government to take over the financing of a major public transportation system that direct government expenditure is being authorized in the reconciliation bill that will go to the President.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment asks the consent that the accepted authorization to grant financing to State governments on a State-by-State basis be rescinded reluctantly in order to provide a strong case for this amendment.  As I understand the amendment, this is meant to reduce Federal budget deficits. It would allow the Congress to impose a capital spending cap which will allow every State to be covered under the reauthorization of highway trust funds. This is a matter of public safety, the safety of our citizens, the ability of States to provide

rural service important 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service is a fundamental part of our Nation's history and is the only national service that is legally subject to the same regulatory standards as other public or private sectors in the country and in the world. The important purpose of the Postal Service is to make a continuing contribution to the economic vitality of this Nation and to the preservation of rural America. This is particularly true in rural areas where our rural communities need to compete against the rest of the country to remain competitive and to expand their business operations.  There are three main ways the U.S. Postal Service collects and distributes paper. The first is its contractual operation with the United States Department of Agriculture. This area is comprised of 23 States and the District of Columbia, including a large portion of rural areas in the northern, central, and southern parts of my

Morning business. Well, I am going to be awhile. Anyway, what I would suggest doing is that Senator Sessions has said that the government would be here before the House passed the bill on November 5. I think what we need to do is send a message to the American people that we are not going to forget that when we come back on November 12 and we have to reauthorize this huge Government program, we are going to be here, we are going to keep doing the work of the country that we represent. So I want to thank Senator Sessions for that advice. I thank him, but I also want to commend Senator McCain, the distinguished Senator from Arizona. So as we said, this is a bipartisan bill. I am so proud that we are able to move forward this kind of bipartisanship in a bipartisan fashion.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great arguments that I have heard in this debate about what is good for the individual and what is good for the economy is that people think that job creators and job doing need more Government so they will work harder and get more for their wages.  That is not true at all, and job creators and job doing need less and less Government. In fact, the last time that a State would have to take back school education programs college scholarships were about $120 billion. In this world where there is too much Government and too much waste, the people that I talked to, parents, grandparents and widows, are pretty much saying, here we go, it is going to be tough because of the loss of education in the United States.

And if the American people understand what that $38 million is really for, then they would understand that not only is there an earmark for the ethanol industry, there is another $13.6 million earmarked in the report for energy assistance for foreign nations. So, again, we have a good example of earmarking, which is why the gentleman's concern is an issue we have to get back on the track of

The election of President Trump and the cuts to the Global War on Terrorism, while devastating to the small rural community in western Tennessee, are only adding to Sergeant Price's burden.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Arkansan Dr. Fred Bourland, who was recently named the International ``Science Teacher of the Year.'' The academic training that Dr. Bourland has developed in both the area of high school and the work that he has done in the field of the Future of Life Institute in the last decade has been a tremendous source of inspiration to me as well as to many others in committee and in the floor.  Dr. Bourland is no stranger to the field of the future of life, which has become one of the most important fields of our cotton industry. In 2002, Dr. Bourland received the former Biotechnology Executive Service Award from the Biotechnology Industry Organization and also received the 2007 Rooney Award for the National Research Council's Center for a New Climate.

The Terrorist Attacks Before and After the War Against Terror will continue to remind us of the need for strong, decisive action.  In the days after 9/11, our war on terror initiated a massive effort to disrupt the networks and networks of al Qaeda, al-Qaida affiliated and affiliated terrorist networks. Through intelligence, training, intelligence collection, and identification of potential targets, our nation mobilized our forces and resources to take out the most dangerous terrorists operating in Afghanistan and in places throughout the Middle East.  Today, these efforts continue to give us a broader understanding of the threats facing our homeland and our war on terrorism.

This bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue a uniform uniform public health advisory and compilation of global crop health reports.

This agreement will require a 60-vote threshold to trigger cloture on the measure.  At this time, I wish to state that this agreement does not and will not increase the Republican majority in the Senate from 51 to 51 in Michigan and 49 to 49 in Alabama.

This bill is unnecessary and does not accomplish much more than to rubberstamp and improve the existing system that carries out our Nation's critical transportation safety system. There are many instances where accidents have occurred on our highways that our Nation does not even know about because the inspector general for the Department of Transportation hasn't finished its review of the history of safety and the agency can't even make a record. When this bill passes, I don't think it will address the looming safety risks that we face as a nation.  As we look at the problems with the current system, I wish we had considered other alternative ways of preventing accidents. I want to speak on that point.  I certainly understand

Mr. Speaker, this House continues to conduct an essential debate over our Nation's policy in Iraq and the war in Iraq. After the Iraq war began in 2003, our military forces stationed around the world used Iraq as a base for operations against Saddam Hussein's regime and Iraqi farmers and businesses who were treated like second class citizens. America's job in Iraq was to do the job, not to create the illusion of a democracy in Iraq. We returned forces to Iraq after 2 years of combat and lost 6,400 American servicemen and -women, according to news reports.  This is why I urge my colleagues to reject the current administration's false promise to bring American troops home before the end of this year and join my Republican colleagues in lifting the economic embargo on Iraq.

I say to the Senator from Nevada, that is correct. As I said, I think that every amendment is fair in both aspects of debate as well as in terms of timing and where there are hearings and the specific amendments. It is not necessarily the time for hearings to be on an issue before the Senate votes on the nomination and amendment on it, unless there are additional amendments that would increase that time as well.  I can tell Senator McCain, I have Senator Hatch's amendment pending. Senator Hatch does filibuster, but in the case of my amendment, if there is a critical question that he does not like and he wanted to pursue it in the early morning hours or whatever, he would have the opportunity to do that, so I respect the Senator from Nevada's opinion.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Foster for yielding the time. I am deeply honored to be able to join my colleague and friend from North Carolina in our effort to make sure the United States Congress has an opportunity to honor one of the great men and women of our history in honor of Medal of Honor recipient John Sheppard.  It is always interesting to see our colleagues who are on the other side of the aisle give us kind of a little talk and comment and say: Well, the fact is John She rogowski you're a bad guy, you're a traitor. You're a bad guy in Vietnam. All these abuses that you just talk about Burma and people there. You said it so well.  So I welcome the gentleman's comments to consider what we need to do about this serious issue, and what we should do and what

You know, I am getting older and I see a lot of those Medicare cuts that are being talked about here, because we know that these cuts are going to be painful and they are going to work very well for seniors and families but a lot of the money that they are cutting goes to $10 billion and $40 billion for the income tax reduction and medical savings account that we are talking about that would be offset very, very strongly by new revenue.  If you look at where we have been in last year's budget--I know the gentleman is a great supporter of tax cuts and tax breaks, and we get $70 billion back in just that kind of a tax break, $20 billion of those taxes would go to entitlement reform and the biggest challenge we will have

The story of sacrifices made is not a story I should need to tell. All Americans in this story want to know that the war is not over for these men and women who have been put through so much to make sure we have made it to the end of the conflict.  Unfortunately, the war is ending, and the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in Iraq are leaving our country because the military strategy of not making progress, of seeing the war ending, continues to fail.  Senator McCaskill, the first woman Senator from Missouri, who we had on the Armed Services Committee earlier this week, has led us in this effort by introducing an amendment which will ensure that the President can continue making future military demands for additional funding. Senator Bingaman has joined us in an effort to keep our troops out

It would allow the public to better understand the steps to take to protect their health care unless we wanted to give them a choice not to do that because we want to continue to intend our citizens to live the best health care we can afford to give them.

Mr. Speaker, I especially want to compliment the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], the chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight for his leadership on the committee and this issue because it is an important one to the Members of this House. And so this process has brought together the Speaker of the House as well as the chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight to allow the system to function properly and for the members of that committee to move forward and make necessary changes to help us and to help health care care be more medical free for our citizens.  I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Conyers] for his leadership on this issue and for all the other Members of this House who support this legislation and want us to provide health care for our citizens, protect them, and make health care affordable for their families.

I know we are friends to them today in the sense that they have stood for things, we have stood for things we have disagreed with them on but they have refused to leave our side of the aisle to say anything other than they want to be friends to us and wish to be strong friends to us. So that is why I am somewhat torn. I am torn because we are friends of a foreign country, and that is the whole point of having a bill like this that is meant to be unbalanced, to be protective of things that we stand for.

We have taken the $500 tax credit that is given to working families for things like health care, the prescription drug benefit. We have actually lowered taxes for business.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroic efforts of Marine Sergeant Dakota L. June for his heroic actions in the war on terrorism when he was shot down in September of 2007 in Afghanistan in a F/A-18 aerial refueling mission from an Afghan Air Force F-16A/B aircraft that was flying over the mountainous area between the capital of the city of Kabul and the point of entry into Nangarhar Province. Despite having the best equipment and best training in the world, the Afghan Air Force was not equipped or trained to deliver a large volume of heavy munitions to the F/A-18 so it was forced to fly relatively low to eliminate the target. Sergeant June's save was a heroic example of teamwork and great courage, something which must never be forgotten by those who would think that their heroism and sacrifice

The question was taken; and (two-thirds having voted in favor thereof) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud that I voted for the coalition budget. The coalition budget cuts spending by $847 billion over the next 5 years without raising taxes on anyone or raising spending by any other coalition budget measure. The CBO projected that Medicaid spending would increase to $8 billion over the next 5 years. Medicare spending would increase by an additional $800 billion. These cuts in Medicaid, Medicare, and Medicare's part B would take away the extra $800 billion.  Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of the bipartisan budget. The bipartisan budget adds $500 billion more to the national debt, a lot of it for non-security discretionary spending, a lot of it for the military. But if you ask the American people, ``How are you going to make ends meet in 5 years if you are cutting money out

This was something that was proposed. That did not come out of committee, but we started in October of 1993 and brought it to the floor of the Senate and we have been having people come back to Ohio asking us to fix this program.  So what did we do? We say we would not do it because we believe it needs to be Haiti. And it is true we are cutting funding for Haiti.

It is important because the American people have a right to know why is this tax bill passed.  We have on the floor a bill, $500 billion. It may be roughly $500 billion that has gone into the pockets of those who earn a little more than $50,000 a year. And it is said we did that because we need tax cuts for working families.

As a former private sector executive and a former member of the Senate Small Business Committee for 8 years, I have been committed to helping the private sector expand their health care programs so they can transfer the savings they create to pay for more benefit packages, and employers, as well as employees, have been doing just that.

That is what happens when you provide millions of students a free education but do not tell them about what it costs to do that here in Washington. If we regret this decision to raise the interest rates, let us understand that this decision affects all taxpayers who have difficult financial circumstances troubling them in one way or another.

Mr. Speaker, politics is all about choices. One of the biggest choices facing lawmakers is what political strategy they will use to convince Americans that they do not need help from the government and that they have the responsibility to provide that help, instead of the government they want to give it to in the first place.  That is why a recent Economy in Progress report indicates that the bill before us today is a bad idea. It provides only modest aid to several big health care providers. It cuts unnecessary penalties for States that do not meet minimum reimbursement standards.  Congress should not be providing billions of dollars to the health care providers the American people most need, but instead must choose to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and create an environment where private dollars can spend without regard to who provides it.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system that required the State to create new government programs was not the most effective way to address the needs of its citizens. In 1935 Roosevelt created welfare reform in an effort to deal with the growing problem of youth unemployment. However, by 1970, over 7 million people were on welfare. To deal with the growing problem of welfare families, in 1970, Governor Brown and several Governors took upon themselves the responsibility of creating a variety of welfare programs to respond to the rapidly growing problem of welfare dependence. The New Jersey Service Agency was created in 1970 to provide a variety of Government and private programs to welfare recipients and their dependents to address their needs.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3200, the Congressional Medal of Honor Women and Girls Act of 2006. I want to thank Chairman Bliley and Ranking Member Hunter for their hard work on this important and well-meaning legislation to honor the men and women who gave their lives in defense of freedom and democracy in the name of honor and patriotism. I also want to honor Memorial Day, a day I consider to be the oldest National Day of Service, and I rise to recognize the courageous service of these service members and their families.  Many historians believe that Congress has historically honored the bravery and devotion of those who served under our Nation's flag by designating a day on Memorial Day that we celebrate and show support for those who serve as an instrument

The  earthquakes bill will affect my constituents at several levels of our Federal Government. First, it would impact the unanimous consent request of the Senate to waive all statutory deadlines so that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may respond to its notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the extension of the drilling and production moratorium on Federal lands.  Second, it would also impact programs to assist homeowners, as well as Federal employees and the National Flood Insurance Program.

Mr. Speaker, it is in the national security interest to have an efficient, efficient and integrated intelligence infrastructure. Unfortunately, in order for the government to do its job and gather intelligence information it must have a significant number of private sector personnel that are able to rapidly and efficiently access information and transform that information into usable information.

It simply provides that the Department of Health and Human Services shall only move forward with a step-up plan to get a replacement device after the time period for minutely reviewing and reviewing and applying the regulations, especially with regard to reexamination and the requirement that they apply rules and regulations under medical necessity and safety guidelines and requirements.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

congress limits government

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important project. In the next couple of weeks, the Federal Government will spend nearly $50 million to build a new water treatment facility at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Federal Way, Washington. This is an important project that Congress should be on the process to approve and has been cleared by the executive branch. The proposed site is in Federal Way and would allow for the first phase of the Federal Government to improve the health of its most vulnerable citizens such as those in the area limits.  The project was begun nearly 3 years ago by our veterans' program. The $50 million project is intended to create 1,000 jobs, to further advance health care in this rural area, to improve the access of veterans and veterans groups to health care, and to benefit veterans who need access to education

Mr. Speaker, the service men and women serving overseas have born the brunt of the global war on terror. They are the first to be born when America first took the first steps toward global security through our Nation's Women of Promise Act, which promised that a special child allowance would be provided if a service member was born overseas and is needed there that needs help. Because the guaranteed health care that ensures a child can leave the same health care system as their parents at home is not available in Afghanistan, Afghanistan coverage is the first service men and women who risk their lives overseas have access to.  But the emergency fuel bill that will be voted on before we leave for this week is much more dangerous. It ties our hands in providing health care to those who are most in need. We need to provide training and equipment for our men and

Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the majority leadership for bringing this bill, S. 2, to the floor today. Congress can do much more to improve the quality of public education. Speaker Gingrich's Education and the Workforce Committee last year provided bipartisan legislation to reform accountability measures used to assess how public schools are performing in preparing our Nation's children for the work force and beyond. We must continue to work to reform congressional oversight of public education and public schools. Today's bipartisan bill provides important reforms to America's public schools by raising the accountability standards so that we can protect the education of our children.  Over the last decade, public schools in our Nation's Capital, which educate nearly 4 million students, have fallen far behind in keeping up with the nation's changes. Since 1986, Washington public schools have been ranked dead last in overall success for

The political ghoulishness of this sort of debate is inexcusable and should end.  The impact of these campaigns of scare tactics is obvious: to reduce abortions, the pharmaceutical industry is now seeking to block the sale of generic drugs that would save Americans hundreds of millions of dollars and significantly reduce the likelihood that individuals are killed by abortion when they receive one. What are these generic drugs? It is the ``essential'' products people need in order to save lives, even though there are also drugs available that simply provide fewer or no benefits. It is hard to

I have lost two colleagues of my own on the other side of the aisle, Senator Pressler and Senator Heflin who were killed last Friday night in a terrorist attack that was carried out by Mississippi militants who were reportedly inspired by the recent attacks in Paris and reported by the FBI to have been in contact with those who carried them out in that country.  The decision, I think, to take a few moments today to speak about the attacks in Paris has inspired me to ask my colleagues to understand that if they go to this town to honor the memory of these two men and their families, those of us who have been in this body many, many years

Mr. President, I rise today, June 6, 2008, the 64th anniversary of D-day, to commend our Army soldiers and sailors for the force that they put on the beaches of Normandy in 1944 to help bring democracy to those countries that had previously been ruled by dictators. I am proud that they did it for their country and for the people of Afghanistan and Iraq as we deal with the military conflicts of the 21st century.  On that fateful day, 70,000 American soldiers went to Normandy without making it home. There were 14,000 American paratroopers on the beaches and 2,000 in the air; only seven Americans parachuted in to help. So many Americans risked their lives for freedom and for their country, and we did not give them enough credit for their valor.  I recall those soldiers on the beaches early this past May

I met with various committees on the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on which I serve, to try to get a really good understanding of this issue.

I hope that we will get back into that debate and perhaps as a second time, I am sure Senator Snowe can come back and summarize in very concise terms, the major issue that has been raised in the debate so far, so I think that we could come back at some length.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The Senate voted by a bipartisan margin last month to extend the demonstration project with unprecedented flexibility for resilience projects. Unfortunately, the House approved legislation that would have crippled the demonstration project--more than 400 projects across the country--which has rendered these reauthorizations redundant.  This week, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will be meeting to consider the full Interior appropriations bill. The inclusion of language which would significantly weaken the demonstration project is consistent with the U.S. Senate's actions, as well as that of many in the private sector, that

In the Public Housing Subsidy Act of 1978, HUD adopted a formula whereby vouchers issued from local housing authorities to certain low-income families are considered eligible for nonadoptive, adoptive, assisted, and eligible religious services as the ``eligible population'' under section 8. These vouchers are then subdivided among eligible recipients.  My proposal would require these eligible families residing in voucher-eligible areas to provide their full income to receive vouchers.  Under current law, eligibility for vouchers is based solely on family size and income, and States

As we will soon see, there will be many more changes needed to make a difference.  Despite this lack of change, there is still hope that peace will finally emerge from one of the most tragic places on Earth: Afghanistan.

Mr. Speaker, if we want the recovery package to be successful, we must invest in job creation and education. Many Republican leaders have spoken in support of the investment that this will do and have said that it is not about spending in the stimulus bill because a decade of new debt and job creation will be so much more attractive if we can simply cut spending this term and focus on raising taxes on the most productive people in this country. However, Speaker Ryan and the House leadership have written legislation which does both. They have both passed a $1.5 trillion stimulus package which I support as well as $1.6 trillion deficit reduction package.  Just last week, in response to the Speaker's statement, Speaker Ryan and the Republican leadership said that they ``would not pay for this tax cut by cutting government programs.'' But if you look

Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Virginia 4 minutes, but I might say, Mr. President, that Senator Boxer has always been an impressive Senator who really is not the kind of person who just shows up with something and not even thought about doing anything about it but then when it does come up the way it has, then I think there can only be two people to blame for it and that is the timekeeper who just does not get the minute count right. We always knew we could keep the time.  I think what is kind of interesting is that if time is not kept right the record on what the vote was will be pretty awesome. I think it is incredible that maybe there is more serious than we know about the length of the time that is taken when you announce a vote, and then I guess the easiest place to

For more than 2\1/2\ years, we have been forced to spend billions of dollars that are not paying for anything, and that is money that could be used for basic services and things that get the American people back to work, that could get coupons in their grocery stores, that could pay for higher education for our kids, and many, many tax loopholes are used to pay for these tax giveaways for coupon-happy millionaires and billionaires.  We also have to remember that our deficit spending budget process in Washington has proven to be flawed for so long because we have not implemented the rules that we had a role to

minimum raising percent 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, last week 20 House Republicans introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. While raising the minimum wage will increase job growth and increase wages for all Americans, it is a step backwards for the American middle class and a step up for the rich and special interest. Those percent of Americans working who do not pay any Federal income taxes are the most disadvantaged of all.  Some think that their subsidies will be the problem and support a Republican plan to create jobs. This plan recognizes that private sector job creation and investment are not the answer to American economic woes. Instead, I will suggest that the working families of America do what we are doing here today, raise their own pay.  Over 6 out of 10 jobs in this country are available to low wage earners who earn at or below the poverty

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the extension of a Federal crop insurance program that is crucial to State farmers. With an enrollment of over 27 million farmers, crop insurance is central to agriculture and to farm family farms across the country. In fact, dairy farmers use more commodity sales than other producers, which is why they have embraced crop insurance as one of the key tools to improve their bottom line.  State crop insurance markets are seasonal. This means that farmers in my State do not have access to market data from all weeks. Therefore, in States where crops are completely unpredictable and farmers can lose whole crops, States can be effectively able to protect against crop damage or drought by protecting coverage against crop losses and high interest rates. Farmers often deal with this uncertainty in two ways. First, they purchase crop insurance

Mr. President, 14 years ago, Congress made a grave mistake. In the dead of night, Congress took the time to propose a budget by which it would pay for $7 trillion in unfunded Federal mandates.

The Republicans created a powerful provision to exempt swaps, bondholders, et cetera, in order to prevent the American people from challenging that fraud on their behalf. The majority leader engineered an out-of-the-mainstream amendment on this because the finance committee chairman at the time said it would, in fact, pass. It passed. So here we are, 4 years later, and we are still doing the same thing.  It is time for the Senate to restore the balance, a balanced budget. It is time to put money back into the Treasury

But let me first say that I do not come to this floor under any illusion that I am going to be able to agree with the Democratic leader about many of the things he has to say, but I do think we should listen and we should ask ourselves very seriously: What is the message that we are sending to the American people? I mean, the basic message, Mr. President, that I would have to say is the same message that I have been saying. I say that we are talking about jobs, we are talking about families, we are talking about peace

Mr. President, I, too, would like to share my concerns in opposition to Mr. Bernanke's nomination to President Obama's Federal Reserve Board. As a fiscal conservative who has been on the Federal Reserve Board for 25 years, I believe this nomination is not only unwise but highly inappropriate. In recent years the Fed has fed inflation on the backs of the economy and has pushed interest rates beyond unsustainable levels. While we have done much to ease this crisis, the Fed has done so at the cost of normalizing prices in the U.S. It is time for a new direction at the Fed.  The Fed chairman has acknowledged that there is no doubt that the Federal Reserve Board needs to take more control of its operations and has called for dramatic changes to the way it manages the bank's balance sheet. We need to fully reexamine the Fed

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the Rules Committee for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, today the Republican leadership has announced that their plan to reform health care will be funded in part by slashing student health care programs. Committee Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is being forced to strike funding from the Republican whip's health care program due to the threat of a veto from the President.  Mr. Speaker, the administration proposed a massive assault on the Nation's health care system with the PAYGO rule which my Republican colleagues on the Rules Committee defied last week and restored balance to the budget process in the first 100 days of this Congress. The PAYGO rule prevented the Republican Congress from unilaterally cutting $1 trillion from Medicare and, under the rule, added $100 billion in savings.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

So if this amendment goes through it will be passed by the committee chairman as one of the safest reforms we could put in the country.  Let me just get this straight.

We know that there are some people who have offered some very reasonable amendments that will have an impact on this bill over the next few days and weeks to come so it would be good to get them put out there, but it is important for Members to be on notice.  Those who wish to offer amendments will be given an opportunity to do so at the completion of the highway bill on Tuesday.

Mr. Speaker, the crisis unfolding in Iraq is deeply troubling to the American people. The fact is that the crisis in Iraq has resulted in the death of nearly 200 Americans in the last few weeks. That is wrong and it must end. The Christian Coalition has reached out to those who have been wounded in the attack on their religious groups and asked for prayers in the wake of the attacks. Speaker Gingrich has worked closely with President Bush to bring an end to the violence and begin the process of rebuilding Iraq. We are the only country which has the religious authority to set Islamic law.  Yet even when I took office, I knew the possibility that there would be religious persecution in Iraq. President Bush also knew that and to date, he has failed to make certain that the overwhelming majority of Iraqis are willing to move ahead with religious freedom and democracy

The only question of whether it is a vote or not whether the pending measure is subject to a cloture motion or not, is irrelevant. It is irrelevant whether Speaker Gingrich's motion to instruct is ultimately rejected or not. It is irrelevant whether Members will oppose or support the motion to instruct. It is irrelevant whether, given the President's plan to increase the debt ceiling by $270 billion to increase the deficit and raise interest rates on American families, Members will actually vote for this measure.

The California Power Administration passed a bill to require an all-of-the-above energy storage solution to be ready to use by the end of the year and allow water storage to be further accelerated through the next year. These initiatives to enable greater access to affordable access to renewable power will allow for a greater permit and faster deployment of new clean renewable energy resources like wind turbines and geothermal resources.

Every day thousands of Americans lose their lives in mass shootings, and one in five is killed in a shooting. The first time this happens, the public is outraged at what happened to them, but it only takes a few days before the public realizes the station is safe. They are outraged by the public at large. They are outraged at the grief felt by these innocent victims, who have finally realized they are not alone.  Madam Speaker, our beautiful and awe inspiring country takes our grief seriously. Yet the laws of our country are increasingly weakening safety. Six weeks ago, I was absent for rollcall vote No. 11, when the second-degree murder penalty was considered in the House.

I am also anxious to see how this debate is resolved before we return to the Senate for consideration of the necessity of further action on the crime bill.  The crime bill before us is flawed in numerous areas. It suffers from one glaring omission. This bill proposes an unfunded mandate that would allow Government bureaucracies to impose virtually any policy deemed necessary to combat crime. It would also codify criminal convictions that people are incarcerated for, resulting in these individuals serving a lifetime sentence without regard for whether there

Unfortunately, the President has chosen not to lead and he has chosen to focus on Iraq instead of addressing the challenges that our troops face every day here in Iraq today. So it is only appropriate that the Senate has bipartisan and many different plans to move forward on a strategy for Iraq and to get this country more focused on Iraq for the long term than we have been for Iraq in the past few years. This weekend the Iraq Study Group released some critical Iraqi report cards.

We introduced language today which seeks to help homeless, impoverished, and in-group/out-group children, and also people without health insurance.  Let me be clear, these are children

Mr. President, it would not. I am advised by the Parliamentarian that it would not be possible to do that unless he read a specific order and then the Senate amendment was allowed to stand in that position. The Senator from South Dakota and I have the same view. So that is the issue the Parliamentarian has to deal with next week when the House and Senate send the supplemental appropriations bill over to the President for his signature. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

secretary republican speaker 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, my friend from New York claims this is not political. Forty-five minutes ago Speaker Gingrich said this is not political, Republican time. They have said it a few times and said it again this afternoon in a press conference. They said he is not paying his troops the money he says he is going to make in the Secretary of Defense account. The money is not going to go to pay the troops.  This is not a $600 million bonus for himself. This is a $1.4 billion cut for the servicemen and the -women.  I submit that this is a budget which benefits those who need the money, those who have contributed to our country and helped them in times of need, those who have served this country before and now they are on the Treasury Department bench. It should not be reserved for political

alvarez protected act 

Final sequence: 

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1775, the National Closest Natural Resources Corridor Act. This legislation is cosponsored by Mr. Cole and is the product of extensive work by my colleague and fellow Texas Congressman, Matt Salmon. This legislation is vital to protect our environmental treasures from drilling on Indian country, and I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in support of the bill.  Congressman Salmon has been a strong supporter of the national [[Page H6648]] Torres del Puerto Juan Alvarez natural resource corridor since 2002, and the bill he introduced in the House last Congress included $8 million in funding to leverage private investment in the corridor, as well as additional incentives for jobs and investment.  The Congress and the administration must aggressively move forward to secure our natural resources and to deliver the benefits of

And now the banks are basically deciding if they are going to give a 1 percent down payment, or a 5 percent down payment. And the bank has said that is fine. But they are downgrading you one rate.  So how do we get there so people who want to buy homes can not only be able to buy a house for the price they

colorado public penalties 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I thank the House leadership for scheduling action on this important legislation. It will benefit the American public, and will increase the government's ability to get the job done in the face of a budget crisis that threatens the safety of tens of millions of hardworking taxpayers and the economic security of American families across the country.  This legislation will be the first step in the Colorado water safety plan to reform what some consider one of the worst safety loopholes in the Federal regulatory system. In many ways, this bill will put penalties on major polluters that cost jobs and clean up pollution.  This bill also will incentivize water use efficiency by closing the water safety loophole and outlawing the use of bottled water as a solvent, a practice already prohibited in the Colorado water delivery system law.  These laws are the work of Members of Congress

updating speaker policy

Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the new millennium. It is expected that our new policy will make the debate over foreign policy more political in nature and will lead to increasingly stronger national defense capabilities as well as more efficient and effective and effective defense capabilities as well as broader national defense priorities. This updating process should include greater national security control over foreign trade and the opening up of American markets to foreign allies to increase the value of the American-made goods and services to both Speaker Gingrich's American Nation and globalized markets in many countries.  The result of this plan is a strong nation and more focused on its military strategy.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued its ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act that limits its employees from being fired for being on the government payroll during the workweek in response to the Office of Personnel Management decision last year to eliminate government workers as employees of large companies. It said that Boeing workers would not be permitted to be fired in response to this hiring provision because this employment provision would in fact allow employees jobs in areas where they are not hired by Boeing.  The Boeing ruling went on to say that such regulations could cause Boeing to have to hire more workers without pay if they were in the government payroll. And Boeing workers said it's just like getting an extension to your job, so you can take it back. It's just like that. I mean, they're taking you back to the
