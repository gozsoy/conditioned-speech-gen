Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3354, the Lobbying Disclosure Act.  This bill is an attack on the democratic process by adding a new set of restrictions on U.S. lobbyists. Among the main provisions of H.R. 3354 is a prohibition on lobbying foreign governments in the United States. The Committee on Rules would have us believe that foreign governments that have contracts with the Federal Government or a particular agency would not be a foreign government which would qualify under the bill. But as noted, this bill will not ban foreign governments from lobbying us domestically, and there is no evidence that foreign governments have

Some proponents claim that the economy is performing well because tax relief has reduced the rate of inflation to record lows and has encouraged economic growth. It is indeed true that lower tax rates have helped create jobs and American growth. But if we want to gain any momentum in the effort to reduce the cost of Government, we must increase the deficit or we cannot be expected to raise the standard of living of average Americans.  One approach is tax relief that will reduce the cost of Federal spending without increasing economic growth

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would change the existing Federal Employment Act to prohibit employers from using race or gender as the basis of hiring or promotion. This change would help ensure that the Federal Government is not discriminating against anyone because of race or gender.  The current Federal Employment Act does not include a clear definition of discrimination under the law. It only provides that discrimination is justifiable under some limited circumstances. That interpretation, as written, allows for employers to continue to make employment decisions in areas where the employer and the employee may disagree

Mr. President, in 2002, the Government of Haiti made considerable progress toward being truly a democratic state and adherence to the principles of international law and human rights. They continue to build on this foundation. However, there is a continuing need for stability in Haiti, a nation at war with itself. That is why we are withdrawing the United States forces from Haiti immediately. The

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for Senator Ensign's amendment to the Energy bill on the basic rule on airport construction. For decades, the Federal Government has increasingly been engaged in the development of airports and other facilities and programs which significantly affect the lives of American citizens and the States they live in. These activities continue to have an enormous economic and social impact on the local communities in which they are conducted. In some cases, the economic and social cost of the Federal Government's involvement in the rulemaking and design of such facilities and programs can be far greater than the economic and social cost of the direct cost. For example, the Federal

Mr. Speaker, today we will take up a bill that has received almost unanimous support in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Presidential Data Privacy and Security Act of 1996. This bill would amend the Privacy Act of 1974 to require Presidential election-year data to be processed under the Secretaries of State, Government and Judiciary offices as well as Election Commission staff in the election infrastructure office. This bill would also expand the legislation to allow the Presidential Election Assistance Commission to undertake the same duties as the Election Administration Board, a new legislative bureau set up to help prevent election-year data loss.  The bill also would amend the Executive Calendar to provide that

In a speech yesterday to students and faculty at the University of Georgia, the administration claimed to support initiatives such as the Student Financial Assistance Program which provides support to low- and moderate-income students to pay for education while simultaneously helping to keep up with college costs. Of course this is another grab for increased taxes to pay for higher education.  To come up with these billion-dollar figures the administration added $13 million to the Stafford loans program, a program which already has about 40 percent higher than expected interest rates over the next 10 years.

Mr. President, I rise to submit this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator McCain. It is a very simple amendment. The amendment simply says that if an Indian tribal government is eligible for funding for an Indian health care program under any of the five health plans under this title and the President of the Federal Government has determined that the administration would not use Federal funds to award this plan to an Indian tribe or individual on account of any reservation other than a reservation in the State in which the reservation is located, that the amount of the Federal funds will not be used to pay the cost of the first 1 year of that program.  This amendment is simple.

In California the courts have found that without these three requirements the requirement of production of documents and information in a timely fashion to establish the identity of the person or entity to which the evidence is being sought would not apply and that state

That law should not restrict the political process in the United States and should not have the effect of limiting political speech in the United States.  Why did we need this amendment?

Mr. Speaker, last week we brought the House back for a week from Memorial Day recess to the House of Representatives for a three-day debate on a bill that passed both houses with overwhelming margins, almost 100 to 1 in the House of Representatives, virtually, including both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives and was approved overwhelmingly by the Senate.  It was the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 1997. I was proud of that fact. I said during the debate that if that bill were to come back here and pass the House today for a vote that it would be the greatest economic growth bill that this country has ever had passed

Senator Notso will be retiring on December 31 after more than two decades of public service in the Senate, the majority leader of the Senate and several years of service on the Department of Labor and Human Resources, and my former Senate and House staff director. Senator Notso is one of the most loyal and effective Senators who ever served the people of the 12th District of Illinois and many members of the Illinois State Senate family have been pleased to see their colleague return to their home

This resolution would be a way of extending the debate because that is the way it has to be done. If we do not have a vote in this House in the next few days, then we

Mr. President, I will be brief. But as this debate is going on about the minimum wage in America and the increase that is being proposed by the administration, the Washington Post editorial page is saying that the most likely way for this country to reach a middle class has been to cut corporate taxes and put more money in the hands of working Americans. We are very pleased that the Senate Judiciary Committee is looking at this issue and has put in place the alternative minimum tax repeal in its conference report. It has taken less than a day for the House of Representatives to vote on this, and that is another indication of how much work has been done in this particular

Mr. Speaker, as the Congress recedes to the recent prejudices of our Democrats in fashioning health care reform legislation, it is time to put our Congressional colleagues on notice that no legislator in this body will be happy to cede to special interests. Indeed, in the passing days of this measure, I am afraid that the opponents of reform will learn their lesson and present us with legislation which is bad for our constituents, and a threat to the system of labor and management that I believed for years would never be allowed to become law.
