Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be here today to urge my colleagues to vote for this bill to provide health care for children under 13 years old. This is a child-centered bill and is about as far from the easy vote it could be, with a lot of connotations.  Yes, there are big changes in this bill to require family planning clinics to notify children when their parents have used Federal funds, but there are big increases in the access standards, the availability and affordability of contraception to millions of American families. Many of the costs of birth control will be paid for by the Federal Government. This is child-centered. The committee under

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Parks, Forests, and Public Lands for his leadership on the bill. This legislation will add new lands to the Mount Vernon National Park, allowing it to once again host mountaineering events and the chance to enjoy nature for the first time in generations.  The Natural Areas Conservation Act of 1978 was enacted to help preserve and improve parks and public lands by improving the planning, management, and utilization of new or previously established lands to enhance the environment and to help safeguard and protect wilderness and scenic resources.  The Mount Vernon is one of my favorite parts of the country and I'm

Mr. President, today we are taking up legislation designed to protect consumers from the unfair actions of many insurance companies on behalf of consumers.  This legislation also deals with transparency and accountability of insurers and will strengthen the efforts to address insurance problems in States like New Jersey and to improve health care policies initiatives in this country.  Most of the Federal government has an oversight responsibility over health care insurance companies that collectively engage in all activities on behalf of consumers who have contracts with these committees. But insurance companies routinely violate these rules and also the end user relationships in providing insurance in the private sector, a practice which has helped stifle consumer choice, undermine consumer protections, and

It is a waste of time to be around here and not represent the people of this country around this approximately 3,000-acre parcel of land.

The terror attack on Israel is in no way related to the ongoing anti-terror ban on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its chemical weapons program. Iran is a sovereign nation, and the perpetrators of these crimes must be held accountable for their actions.  One might ask why the United States of America is supporting Saudi Arabia at this time? Well, the Saudi Arabian Government continues to use its most provocative rhetoric on the international scene and continues to inflict havoc and violence on
