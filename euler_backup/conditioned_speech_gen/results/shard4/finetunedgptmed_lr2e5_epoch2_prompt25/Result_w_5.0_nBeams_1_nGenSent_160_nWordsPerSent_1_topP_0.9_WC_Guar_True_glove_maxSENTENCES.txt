Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP remains below 5 percent over the first four quarters after enactment. H.R. 50 is not intended to eliminate the deficit in the first year. It is simply a limitation on the growth rate of GDP over that period of time in order to get at the deficit in the long term.  The question here is not whether to leave the tax provisions in place or not to repeal the State and local income tax provisions. They have been removed so that we have less spending than we would if those provisions remain in place. I urge support of the amendment.   238 ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban in Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that big chunks of that were not constitutional and could not be changed, but that partial birth abortion was, and it took a very narrow Supreme Court decision.  And in Mississippi and Arkansas, a record 7 to 2 vote overturned the Arkansas ban. And Arkansas, Pryor, wrote an opinion, 7 to 2 vote. He wrote this: ``Prohibiting an abortion under circumstances involving severe medical emergencies is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to pass a constitutional amendment that would require a majority of both Houses to enact such legislation, and thus ensure that the procedures to save the life of the mother are available to the women.''  Then he went on to say: I strongly support the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision * * * if done only because it stands as the supreme legal standard, not because of its precedent as to the constitutional rights of women, since

Senator Mitchell and I and others are trying to do that because I think we can do that. But they have to have insurance companies be able to be able to choose the products that are best for their patients. That is the purpose of this program which we are developing together with Senator Dorgan and others. We also developed what the Senator from Minnesota has suggested is a health care health care care reform bill and a medicine bill that is very similar, I think, to what we are trying to do.

I thank the nation for their continued support and efforts to support the victims and their loved ones of this horrific crime that took the lives of 32 students and staff and injured more than 50 others in Blacksburg and Blacksburg South.  Those who were injured, some severely, will receive treatment as they return home from the hospitals. In addition, we hope to convey the condolences of this Senate to their families. Our prayers remain with them at this difficult time.  As a Senator for more than 10 years, I have observed the work of the FBI and our intelligence community as it investigates these crimes and the individuals involved in them.

Mr. President, today, I filed an amendment that would increase funding for basic research at the National Institutes of Health, and restore cuts made under the Republican budget. The bill before us cuts NIH by $40 million from the Senate version and $70 million from the House-passed budget resolution. The provisions of the House-passed budget resolution that are included in this reconciliation proposal will restore these cuts and delay research that would otherwise result in treatments and cures that our country can now afford. Research institutions will continue to receive full reimbursement for up to 100 percent of their research costs. But these efforts will be constrained if Republicans continue to prioritize funding for such critical research as cancer and diabetes. This is the position we all should be taking: we should not turn our backs on basic research.

Al Qaeda has been routed. Our attacks on Iraq provide an al Qaeda safe haven. And Afghanistan is now regaining its ground with Taliban leadership and bolstered by the drone war. Meanwhile, in Iraq, the malign influence of Iraq's sectarian extremists has spread and strengthened.  Our inability to deal with any of these challenges through withdrawal now will only add to the internal strife in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, included in the Democrats' health plan are massive cuts to Medicare Advantage that could result in a loss of health care for millions of people. I see it is only 11 months to the year that we will begin implementing the budget plan for the Federal Government in Congress, and yet the Democrats seem to be spending their time and energy on the promise of a tax cut and other proposals that they will not have a chance to put into law before the year is out. Now the only way they can finance their promise to the American people of a health plan that will state that it will take those taxes away is to cut and slash Medicare.  In 2010, Medicare, which benefits millions of seniors, will have a $174 billion reduction in payment as part of a Republican plan. The Democrats promise a 5-percent cut on January 1, 2009. I cannot understand that. But that is how they could bring this to a vote today

Since taking the floor in 1988, Brett has played over 1,500 games for the Cardinals in their four seasons in the NCAA and scored over 1,100 points for the Pirates. His ability to play three positions on both sides of the court, representing his two schools, solidified his position as a cornerstone player in a NCAA basketball dynasty. In fact, that dynasty had three different winning streaks, breaking the record held by Gary Payton II, the other UCLA legend who dominated the game. When you consider all of the hoops Brian helped invent during his tenure with the Cardinals,

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. In my district and across the country, pregnancy discrimination persists, especially against pregnant women and mothers of children under the age of 18. According to the National Partnership for Women & Families, 5 million pregnancies in 2009 were the result of discrimination in the workplace or the rise of illegal immigration.  We must address the issue of pregnancy discrimination now if we are going to end the health care and financial crisis that has plagued our Nation's workforce. Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member DeGette, and I recently introduced the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which would prohibit employment discrimination based on pregnancy status.  Moreover, the bill would help employers provide benefits and opportunities to the people who need them. As Congress debates health care reform, this bill is a critical step forward. The Fair Labor Standards Act would permit employers to require all employees to work all hours, not only during work

The primary focus of this hearing is to discuss the administration's proposal to expand Medicaid benefits to more low-income individuals.  The  workflow of care from health workforce centers is broken. Many of these centers were set up to provide services to medically underserved populations, but today, few care providers work in these settings, and care that is delivered often substandard. Inadequate care standards lead to significant backlogs in treatment services. In addition, individual carers are disproportionately affected, and providers are reluctant to work in these settings,

Mr. Chairman, I would simply state that the House is in a strange position today because, under the rules of the House, every item that is voted on can be brought to the floor of the House and voted on as though it had not been voted on yesterday or last Friday or this week and therefore this Committee bill which we are considering is just another way for us to be able to take the House through this very difficult time in which we are in and to put this gentleman in charge of the Department of State.  I would just say this: It is curious that we would have to make the argument here and bring the gentleman from California (Mr. Berman) before the Committee on Appropriations to be able to do this.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the motion. I certainly hope our colleagues will vote to instruct conferees on a basic issue of Medicare spending which was just recently brought to the Senate floor by the President of the United States and other Congressional Democrats and Republicans. I agree with this point of view because if we are to extend tax cuts for the wealthy, a rising tide lifts all boats--benefits to millions of seniors, the economy, and to everyone involved in the American political process--that point is well-made.  However, in my view the motion we are considering today, is in this spirit. It is a motion that continues the bipartisan efforts to allow the Administration and other Members of Congress to enact a 7-year plan to avert a deep fiscal crisis. I think it is a good first step.  Let me read what the President said in his farewell address to the Nation: ``The challenge of rebuilding our

In honor of Women's History Month, I would like to recognize Dr. Giorgina Pinedo-Rolon. Dr. Giorgina Pinedo-Rolon was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and moved to Texas in 1980 to get a degree in women's studies from Texas Southern University in Houston. After completing her degree and earning a master of arts in nursing in Florida, she returned to Venezuela and became one of the first female dentists in the metro-Caracas area to receive the award of the Bolivian Dental Association.  In 1994, after being promoted to pediatric dentist, she set out to help guide the education of Venezuelan women. She went on to expand the service to other low-income, medically underserved populations, and would partner with pre-crisis clinics, private dentists, and other community organizations to provide quality health care for underprivileged women.  By delivering health services to patients from areas throughout her home state of Venezuela, Dr. Pinedo-Rolon

The fact remains over 135 amendments were submitted on time to the Rules Committee, and a record-breaking number of 50 amendments were actually brought forward by Members on both sides of the aisle to the Rules Committee because it is so important that this bill was understood as the clear policy of this House that if you are against this bill because it was not really the issue it was supposed to be about to the American people and because it is clearly the reason that this is not what it is really about that so many Americans are really concerned that this Speaker is bringing to the floor tonight that seems not only to be not a legitimate reason but that it is not even what the fact that it is not just about is going to do. It is simply a way of persuading the American people that this bill, which is being touted as a bipartisan bill, is really not for them, is for the millionaires and for the special interests.

The American people see through the Washington dysfunction and want us to work across the aisle and in a bipartisan fashion to achieve their own success and high priorities.

President Clinton and Congress have made good on this promise. He and this Congress put in a comprehensive national health care plan.

Mr. Speaker, for folks who were just turning on the TVs back in their districts, it means that the Congress has been in session for the last 2 weeks, 2 weeks longer than the House of Representatives has been in session in the last 2 Congresses. That is an absolute yield of a 60 percent increase in our committee staff's pay, our staff's salaries and benefits.  I want to emphasize that our committee staff and our Members have done an incredible job under the tremendous leadership of our staff and our committee integrity staff, and it is being done without any pay increase. It is just a tremendous success.  It was reported to me earlier today that our committee sent back over 80 percent of the 90,000 staffers that they have back here. That is about a third of the committee staff that they had in last year. The chairman has certainly worked with all those staff

By the way, the gentleman points out Canada, a country that has basically a two-tier health care system, the Canadian health care system, and then we have a United States system that basically has a one-tier system.  Is the gentleman aware that it is estimated that in America nearly $300 billion is spent annually on health care, but less than $10 billion is spent on patient services? That is less than the amount that the United States spends on prescription drugs? Is the gentleman aware that less than prevalent in Canada, Canada spends less on prescription drugs than the United States spends on prescription drugs? Is the gentleman aware that in Canada we don't have the Government bureaucrats trying to run a hospital or run a pharmaceutical company?

So, Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the ACA, the Affordable Care Act, as an overreach of government over people.

ObamaCare is yet another government takeover of healthcare that is at odds with the freedoms and freedoms of Americans.

Madam Chair, first, I would like to thank Congressmen Brown and Crist for an excellent amendment that improves the bill considerably. On the point just raised about transparency, this amendment would make it a requirement that when a nonprofit entity that has not received a Presidential award or medal by the President of the United States or the U.S. Government has made a grant or investment from funds that may result in tax-exempt taxation by the Federal Government, that the entity also meet the new disclosure requirement that we have in the bill by making a statement that that funds have come from a source that was not a long time ago but does not have to be brownfield redtape, but does include in the statute a list of where the organization is going to donate the money.

Mr. Speaker, today I would like to draw public attention to a great miscarriage of justice that will happen to American citizens starting June 8. The Government issued a permit to use the property in that parcel of land for the regulation of a municipal waste operation. This waste operation is actually held in one of the homes in that parcel of land. It is no longer in use for millions of dollars worth of taxpayer money to maintain billions of dollars worth of air-conditioning fixtures. The waste operation is owned by an outside contractor. It was allocated millions of dollars and then the Government exercised its monopoly power and, instead of using the permit for the proper environmental protection, these contractors decided they wanted to construct a hotel.  I commend the families who put this waste facility on private property so this potential waste can be cleaned up for free. In the meantime, let's follow the will of the people, not the government.

Steve lost a lot of money in his very first venture, but not because he did not want to make money but because he could not get the check he needed to pay for the expenses of his first business from IRS records. He lost all his savings because of it, but he kept his account for his children even when they were in college to get the check for their first year of routine schooling.

So when you hear a politician or an editor or a commentator declare that Federal spending is out of control or that our Nation is headed for a constitutional crisis, bear in mind that it was not our Founding Fathers who intended that spending power be concentrated in the Federal Government. They put it in the State governments because they understood that without it there would be no checks and balance and that the only way to stop the Washington spending Bush machine was for Congress to return power and money to the States.

First, it clarifies that funds that are issued in fiscal year 1994 may not be used for issues or activities for which an authorization is included in the budget resolution of the administration of the Department of Homeland Security. It also clarifies that funds included in that budget resolution must be approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security.  Madam Chairman, these requirements have been on the books in past appropriations bills for many years, and the Secretary of Homeland Security's office has informed me that they believe it makes sense to have a greater consistency in the guidance provided in past authorization legislation.

Madam President, I rise today to offer this amendment because I am concerned about the provision in this year's bill that would reduce the active duty strength of the Navy Reserve by 30 percent. It would take this great Navy and the Navy Reserve to a level of only 200 ships that the Navy and the Pentagon have said they want to offer the public for the National Defense Sealift and Other Services Fleet in this bill. It would be the largest ship force in the history of the Navy and this is not the time to be adding these additional ships to the National Defense Information System. We can also expect this massive change to the Marine Corps' Armed Forces Reserve with cuts in the Reserve component for the limited number of ships available for the Active-Duty Reserve.  The Navy is calling this an acquisition reform bill, but it would actually increase the ship numbers. If you look at the exact numbers, we are not talking about some mythical 25 percent

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chair, I just want to make a couple of observations and perhaps corrections. As Chairman Goodlatte said, this amendment would not prohibit the Secretary of State from granting visas for the purposes for which they are to be granted if they make that money available on a noncommercial basis and would not change the law so that the Secretary of State would not be the one in the business of enforcing that speech prohibition.  Secondly, the gentleman says that we have tightened the language; this amendment would change that. It would apply to people who have a fee, but they do not have to do a fee. That is a distinction without a difference.  We are a nation that was founded on the principles of equality, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, and fundamental rights to speak and to publish. The safety of the American people is not a question for debate

This is yet another attempt to damage the very fabric of our country and threaten the very support that has made this country great. It is a hard choice to voice my support for the rule on the Interior appropriations bill, but I do have to note that I support the proposal and request that my name be added to the list of cosponsors.  I thank the majority leader for making sure I can be included in this important legislation.

Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment to protect Americans from the costly regulations this administration or future administrations may try to issue before the President signs the bill we have just passed into law in May.  Americans have a fundamental right to know what regulations they are going to be subjected to if they want to make a business decision with the future in their hands. It is not too much to ask for that, particularly when this administration is even considering a costly bill, requiring all 50 states to regulate carbon, methane, and air pollution by 2030.  A GAO study concluded that this administration's own national energy strategy, which proposes to be implemented in 2018, is very vague. How are EPA employees and employees from State governments to know the next major public health and safety regulation the President's EPA may introduce in 2017? This administration can do no more than pretend this confusion is based on an outdated regulation like the Clean Water Act or the Air

Mr. Speaker, the last Congress my colleagues on the other side of the aisle tried to close down the Department of Education. The American people rejected that effort. We passed new accountability measures and demanded that Congress and the administration take action to make sure that the Department of Education was working to protect students and families from the abuses of the Republicans in office. Republicans would not vote for those measures and Democrats offered our own measure to provide what we thought was an effective way to assure accountability and public safety at the Department of Education so we could have students and colleagues believe that we cared about the public interest when we actually weren't doing the work that we wanted done. That's where the plan came from.  The plan that came from across the aisle, Republicans and Democrats alike, was something like this: We would increase school violence prevention funding by $5 million from 1994 to 1995. We would increase protection from weapons of mass destruction by $4 million

The 11 who have died in the Vietnam war are not only not forgotten but never known or acknowledged for their service to this country. It is because of the contributions of those United States heroes that we are free today. And it is because of the sacrifices of those brave young Americans in the Armed Forces of the United States that we have the peace we enjoy today. But recognizing these brave heroes, their service to our country and their willingness to sacrifice for it is a right we should never take lightly.

Mr. President, the Senator from Washington is correct. The GAP and other funding mechanisms in EPA have increased over the years to meet the needs of EPA. The principal means through which these funds have been raised is the innovative way that the State and local contributions are used to put together and implement a single approach to addressing the problem as determined by these regional actions. As you know, and as has been correct for many years now, environmental problems are complex and take different forms in different locations across the country, in different cities and different States, different roles in Federal government. It is very important that all environmental problems be addressed in a cohesive manner. That means developing a statewide level of action that is responsive to the health and environmental needs of the people that are involved.  EPA understands this and understands how it contributes to solving those problems. However, there are ways through which EPA can better fulfill its role in addressing and acting on the many issues

I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the use of funds to administer the wage rate requirements under Davis-Bacon. It is yet another effort by this Congress to undermine wage standards and to reduce the cost of service on American workers in this country. That this has not been done for 25 years is a great achievement given the enormous cost to labor pay and benefits paid by all American workers.  I want to take a few moments of this debate to describe the problem I believe we are talking about here. There is a fair number of horsemeat producers around the country who are buying their meat at low prices and are not getting paid very well. However, they are still making good money as long as they are operating under the prevailing wage system. The reason why we are concerned that this amendment will slow them down is because they have no reasonable way of assessing the costs of running a business under Davis-Bacon. The cost-benefit

Mr. Speaker, on this St. Patrick's Day, we have an historic opportunity to achieve peace in a long-troubled part of the world--Northern Ireland. No one can deny that peace was once in doubt in this part of the world because of the continuing violence and the continuing attacks on the people of the State of the British and Irish people in this day and age. No one can say that it has been completely and completely resolved in all the time that we have been working on the Northern Ireland issue in the House of Representatives.  I would note the outstanding contributions of the former chairman and a number of the present members of the International Relations Committee in our effort to ensure that the peace process in Northern Ireland continues.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great arguments that I have heard in this debate about the minimum wage has been that there are many students out there whose wages are not enough to afford to have a minimum wage job. If we are to reduce the cost of living for everyone and to balance the budget for all, we must create a living wage for all Americans. That is one of the first things we must do in this Congress as Speaker.  In the House, we passed legislation which will give millions of Americans a chance to earn a livable wage and at the same time reduce the tax burden on the middle class.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the time this morning. Mr. Speaker, in 1963, while confined in the Birmingham city jail, Dr. Martin Luther King became the Nation's first Black leader to be sentenced to death by a Federal court in the United States for protesting against the Nation's Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka Missouri in 1954 and Mississippi in 1954. It is indeed with a heavy heart that I rise today to recognize that this is the last day of this new year and that there will be no more cases pending in the D.C. court before a full and fair trial of Dr. King, Jr. This will only be the second time since 1954 that this case will be handled by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in the United States. This is a clear rebuke to the Justice Department's punitive schedule which has resulted in the mistreatment of the King family by the Justice Department's death penalty

I thank the Chairman. I will say that this amendment marginally improves the bill, but it does not change our fundamental opposition to it. But it does further restrict the amount of money that could be spent to carry out this act and impose on Members of Congress an undue burden of enforcement on the bill in the past and the new administration and President that are elected.  It says that only House and Senate Committees could use the Federal funds if the government agency requested them to do so under certain conditions as to the opposition of a particular Member to the act as it came out of committee and the need to provide public notice of the proposal that would be made for them to take action in that regard by announcement welcomed by other public entities, but not by Members of the House and Senate.  This is a restriction which is based on a very positive reading of the letter that was made to the President by the director of the Congressional Budget Office about the concept

Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim this time, but I am not in opposition to Mr. Connolly's amendment. Although I do support the gentleman's amendment, it has to be done in a way that is not clearly defined to prevent Federal agencies from having to make personnel decisions based on political points of view or other efforts to influence the public to gain their vote for the agency and its decisions to pay for that person's services that this agency makes so that they can claim some spending increase and also that they might say they have had to use Government office and department funds to secure that support that they have earned.  The problem with this amendment is that it circumvents a very fine law that has been successfully enforced since 1973 and that has required Federal agencies, including this very large agency, to follow through on its own requirements that it must set aside their resources so that it is not tied up in a situation where it has to set aside funds for another

Madam President, my amendment limits the encouragement of the development of natural gas resources beneath the Outer Continental Shelf to the coastline, off the coastline and off of Federal lands and waters and would require that permits must be provided to allow for the economic development and the development of both natural gas and oil and other resources off of Federal land and waters as well as off of Federal and State land and waters to bring additional resources in to this area for the benefit of future drilling. These provisions would be included in the legislation passed today in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3930. These provisions are required under the existing Outer Continental Shelf lease limits which would currently authorize approximately $2 billion annually in offshore lease sales, royalties, and expenses.

This war on terrorism has taken on a new and complex look for many Americans because of the terrorist attacks of September 11 and Operation Iraqi Freedom. As Afghanistan has grown into the largest country in the world and as Iraq has sought the reunification of its troubled and divided country, the most immediate challenge facing our troops has become the post-9/11 issues we face here at home and abroad.

As my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of these important projects and in support of the North Central All-American Power System on the Menomonee and its many other local and State residents and businesses who rely on it for their local and State needs in this area of the country and all across the country that need it most we have people working to keep the lights on in rural areas of the country so we have the opportunity to work to provide the opportunities we want to help build and maintain these important highway motorcycle trails. But the conference report on this bill forces the complete elimination of the Menomonee Indian Patrol motorcycle program.  Mr. President, I know this is not a radical concept to me. I know they have done some things that will make this program more viable. For example, the emphasis has been laid on allowing

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to state the obvious, but an obvious that is all too often overlooked, and that is that the National Forest System is one of the best investment opportunities available to States and local governments in the land use flexibility of our public lands. I think it is important that we take this opportunity to remember that our national forests truly are our Nation's greatest public and private resources and wisdom and natural beauty. I am proud to say that I am proud to represent an area that holds tremendous mineral potential.  And I am very proud of the Montana wilderness plan. Wheeler Range. This is the largest single wilderness plan in the entire country. In 2 years, there have been over 12,000 acres selected for wilderness protection. Montana was the only State in the Union that had one of its own. Montana also has been the lead State in the creation of green trails in our forestlands. Over 37,000 miles

Mr. President, today the Senate is finally being allowed to vote to confirm two consensus judicial nominees who should have been voted on months ago. Our national debate over judicial nominations has been so contentious in the last several months that the Senate Judiciary Committee has heard testimony on at least eight times this year on the judges and only four times in the entire past decade. This is the first time in over a decade that the Senate has been allowed to vote on these three of the most central judicial nominations in history, the most highly decorated Federal judges, judges with more than 2 years of judicial experience, and judges confirmed by the highest levels of Congress and the State of Utah.  It is unfortunate that some on the other side of the aisle do not want to give the Senate the opportunity to vote to confirm these two outstanding nominees today and do so in a timely fashion. The Senate could have taken this action a month ago. I hope that when they return

It's a sadness that I think our great Nation will be one long day without the character and character of Congressman Joe Wilson of Illinois, who has been my friend and my colleague for the last 11 years I've been here in the Congress of the United States. He is a man of great love and grace. He's also a man of great counsel and great leadership. And I think those who know him best know that Joe Wilson is the Nancy Reagan of this House of Representatives and of America.  Joe Wilson served the people of this Nation for 25 years, his first term in Congress and a lifetime in this body. He has been my colleague on the committee for 11 years.

Mr. President, I agree with much of what the Democratic leader has said about the importance of education. In fact, I agree with all of the comments by the Republican leader. The issue for me is not a single choice for education or for education policy that is to be decided by this particular particular provision that we are dealing with in this particular particular bill specifically. I believe that what I have today is a real compromise to actually accommodate a number of different interests and the possibility of some offsets which are to be determined by the bill. So, for example, to the benefit of low income students and to yield a couple of important points to the Democratic leader, I will go through what I believe are the very significant points.  First, the Republican leader's education bill does not provide tax credits for private school tuition, education expenses, or other private education costs for low-income students. The Republican leader's bill does not give any tax credit

I commend my colleagues who have worked so hard to make sure that we achieve that goal.

It is not possible to give the select panel and the public this many more times without resorting to a constitutional crisis.

The only real difference between the two budgets would be that one spends far more than the other does. The difference is not partisan, but rather, this resolution is structured so that all deficit spending is now subject to constitutional scrutiny by the authorizing and appropriating committees, a real test of whether the rules do not keep the parties and the current Congress from shifting the burden of deficit spending from the Congress, the

Therefore, the Senate will debate and consider that matter tomorrow, as the majority leader indicated, and I will make an announcement on that shortly. There will be no rollcall votes on Tuesday, or Wednesday, or

Mr. President, if my colleague will yield. As Senator Casey leaves, I thought his point about longest night and every day that follows will be the most important point we will make for us to remember as Democrats in this Congress. That is that you are most likely to be on the Senate floor in the middle of the night in January as Republicans are in the middle of the night. They have been operating for a long time in the middle of the night and they are like a light switch that is supposed to come back on if you are a Democrat and you are on the planet. You turn that on and you see that there are people wandering the streets or walking the streets. You wonder how you are going to pay for the taxes and the things that you think are really important. Maybe you have problems with this budget, or that budget. You have problems with that environment or that environment. But you have to get over it and overcome it

Mr. Speaker, the American people have spoken. A strong majority of Americans do not believe that special interest groups who receive funding from the Federal Government should be allowed to influence elections. Those groups include special interests that are on the front lines of many problems in our country today, with significant influence in the political process and on the issues of the day.  Speaker Gingrich has a tremendous opportunity. He is speaking now to the American people, not from a speech hall. His message is simple. His message is clear. It is the voice of the American people, Mr. Speaker. If he is listening to them, Mr. Speaker, then he has committed his political career to America's most critical issues. America's elections are fundamental. The American people cannot and will not accept a President who blindly adopts legislation that provides special interests with billions of dollars in taxpayer money. The American people demand change.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I know he has a matter he wishes to discuss, and it is not within the time or the context of this Senator's time that I have on my side of the aisle. But I would like to make some points before he is done with what he is going to do next here on this matter.   Refuge States are States that have Oregon and Washington. And they have a certain status. They are federally owned, they are federally regulated, they are federally administered. So they are recognized by the Bureau of Land Management, by the Fish and Wildlife Service.  You can see in the chart this State recognizes Oregon and Washington. Some of the folks who are coming here may not be familiar with this. But from June to November of 2006, when the House was being run by this Republican majority, their number one priority was to change the size of that

Mr. President, I am a proud cosponsor of the pending amendment because I feel that education is so critical to this country's future. The worst possible outcome is for some measure of cost that education will bring the benefits of educational opportunity to a bill-driven country such as ours. It is very difficult to negotiate a budget when there is not funding to be had in education. So the President has submitted his budget to Congress, but unfortunately it does not meet the present needs of the United States of America.  I appreciate the good work that the Secretary of Education, Dr. Arne Duncan, and the Secretary of Education, Mr. Gates, have done and wish them well in this task. However, our Nation has a deep need to reform the educational system. In the last few years, there has been a dramatic change in this Nation. For the first time in almost 80 years, 4 million Americans have gone to college. Last year there

His son was born in the same house and married John to his grandmother and uncle. John and his family, his wonderful wife, worked there for nearly 50 years and brought that experience and the strong passion he had as a member of the military, his service, the town of Edgewater, the ability he had to raise his family to be part of the community that had veterans in that community, and the fact that he was so

I hope the gentleman from North Carolina stays on the floor. You know, I am dismayed because this is the first time in a long time we have debated and passed a budget for the United States of America that is not balanced. We have passed it for the last 6 years under the leadership of the Republican Party in the Congress, but the only time in a long time that has happened is because there was a scheme of Republicans around here in the House to put an earmark in a program to spend money on flat-out pork-barrel spending. That was not as efficient as going in and doing it.  I know people in the Senate have been making plans, and I hope the Chairman has some idea as to what is going on on the other side in the other body.

The Senator is quite right, with this one exception: We have provided ourselves with universal comprehensive health insurance. We get the choice of some 200 other health insurance plans that include a national network of doctors, and the way the law works is that if you are a member of a group like the American Medical Association, you get choice. We just don't have the choice of some other plans that are on the individual market in the United States. We are provided a universal system of health insurance. But there is another way to spend the same money, and it is given to a small group of people, individuals, employers and small business people.

Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago last Monday I was a young television reporter in a small town called Saxonburg, PA, which now happens to be the home of the four Monday Night Football playoff games. The day before the game, the Houston Texans beat the Cincinnati Bengals, the only team that had not been to a playoff game since winning the Super Bowl in 1966. The win came against the Cincinnati Bengals on a Wednesday night because that was the only day that the FBI--because the fans gave the game away--also gave away the game. I don't think most people know that this was a match played in front of a Webb Airport; it was not played in one of the 7,000 hotels and motels that are spread around the rest of the country.  Now, on any other Monday night, the local newspaper would have printed a note to the fans saying that the two teams were tied, that there were four teams ahead and four

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to denounce in the strongest possible terms the ghastly policy of the Palestinian Authority, which imposes the death penalty on dozens of people for holding up the United Nations with their own hands in order to denounce the unjust rule of the land in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Under this new elected government the United Nations would have to stop working at all to pass the London Charter on the condition that the new government in the West Bank would at least release from prison the New York Times reporter, Walter Duranty, and others who were arrested in connection with the reporting. The rule of law is out of date and we are committed to restoring it. Mr. Chairman, I support the goals of the United Nations and have voted in favor of the creation of this organization because it is the only powerful vehicle that can speak out against tyranny, protect human rights, and defend democracy.  I do not support the current Palestinian Authority,

All we are trying to do in the legislation is to go a little further and get a few more areas where this is already working so that we don't have to go back to the last 10 years where we went from five Texas cases a year to three Texas cases a year and 4 States having settled in the last decade or so and San Diego has dropped all of those cases and gone back to the last 3 years. I don't think that is going to work.  I don't want to say Carlos Slim or Mexicanos, the biggest companies, but our population is growing.

Oftentimes it does. In one of the cases that our colleague from New York reflected on, it was costing her hundreds of thousands of dollars. If a court is going to do this, it has to make a case to all of the parties and to all those who might be affected for their benefits to pay for it. And in this particular case, the taxpayer will have to pay this $4 million cost.  So how does one pay for the costs when we are paying for it? The cost that our cost that costs this $4 million rental will go to is the taxpayers' tax dollars that are being put in this loophole, these luxury cars, which is no way to spend the taxpayers' money.

Mr. President, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, it is so remarkably easy from time to time to do something. This is one of those times.  The President of the United States said to us today that he was considering what he called a 100-day bill of the United States Government that would provide the American people not a freeze of taxes or a cut of spending, but a total, durable, rational, permanent reform of the tax and the spending system. That is certainly possible, a goal that the American people can support.  If it is really a 100-day bill, it is a good reason to do it. If the President wanted to get this done, he could do that.  I do not believe that there is a Member in this Chamber who is more committed to the idea that people in America will continue to pay a lower tax rate than they do now.

Let me conclude on this thought. Here is the record. We had tax cuts of $194 billion. That is the record. That is what happened. And in fact the President never said one thing like that was about tax cuts, which we promised to do and the American people now believe that he was not going to do it in the last election either because of the statesmen he made so much of on the other side of the aisle.  I had the opportunity to go back on some of the tax cuts we made because there were checks on those tax cuts that were signed by President Reagan and the Vice President. Those checks could not exceed an amount in excess of $9 million, you know your mailbox was checked out, and they did not come back. They were not there. The checks were there. And they were real. There were people who worked there. There was checks. We have thousands of thousands of people in good jobs now,

This tax relief was a clear and convincing message to all Americans that we are not just doing the American people a favor but really making a difference in their lives. The stimulus alone in our country has already provided $500 billion to families that had lost their jobs. This tax bill is another step in making the cuts that the Speaker has promised and demanding of us.  Mr. Speaker, my bill, the U.S.-Mexico Initiative Reauthorization Act, increases cooperation between the federal government and our many Mexican partners.

This legislation will help more of our businesses open and will help to create more opportunities for all Americans.

I urge my colleagues to join me in the support of this resolution as well and to support our troops in our time of need to bring them home to the United States safely and secure as soon as possible from the threat that we now face them.   Mr Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues to this resolution to give our men and women in the military a boost so they may return to their families on the home front soon after they leave.  Since President Reagan, we have had a surge of 200,000 men and women deployed overseas every year. A surge for them is a very important time and event, not just for them, but for all of us. It is particularly important to us because it gives them a chance to live under our laws and for us to follow the rules

Mr. Speaker, my friend and colleague, the ranking member, asked that we look at this very briefly because it is perhaps too early in the business to be able to say much more about it but I think it is very clear that what the committee is asking for is that they look very carefully at this because the problem is going to be accepted as long as it is not increased in the amount of more than one-half the amount that we are asking for by Members of Congress because it will be felt that that would be too much to ask Members of Congress to pay so that colleagues might not feel compelled to take advantage of that, and that they might be able to make their own choices on this.

Madam Chair, I stand in opposition to the amendment offered by my dear colleague, Mrs. Torres, that prohibits the President from removing any items listed in this bill as humanitarian relief if those items fall into a State that is in serious trouble and needs help for its people or for its infrastructure needs in the fight against terrorism or other security challenges that might be posed by that terrorist threat on our own soil. But if it is not within our own hands to stand up a program that has the support of the Congress that is going to put pressure on countries that may not like what is going on but that the President is willing to go and ask for what he says he wants in a case like that, then I think Mrs. Torres and all of us are being disingenuous in offering a solution.  In fact, for the last 20 years, the reason we have rebuilt Iraq's infrastructure has been because of the work of those private sector private sector loans

We can go down a path of too much debt for too long or we can go down a path of increased economic growth that brings increased prosperity and lower interest rates. Both can be very good choices for our country and both have the potential to be very good choices for the American economy and the American people if we focus our attention and our efforts and efforts to both focus on the growth and the creation of the American middle class and also to make some European-style reforms in terms of their welfare states.  Our agenda should focus in both directions. We should do everything in our power to assist American small businesses, to get their entrepreneurs back on their feet, to get them going again by bringing more certainty to them through the creation of a much needed infrastructure program that allows small business to build America again and will help grow it

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system that replaces real work with handouts was doomed to fail and begin to fail from the start. FDR knew that the Federal Government did not have a balanced budget when he signed Roosevelt's budget into law in 1933. But he did not know that the Federal Government would spend more money on the spending of those on welfare than it did on work itself.  As poverty skyrocketed, FDR and the American people were horrified. The defense budget he unilaterally provided for all 50 States didn't do enough to assure quality of life for families trapped in poverty. His entire budget superseded the needs of South Carolina's South Carolina retirees starving south Carolina starving South Carolina South Koreans starving Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans Koreans dakotans

Well, I'd say to my friend from North Carolina that he was talking about the fact that seniors will see this doughnut hole, their prescription drug plans will be even more expensive because those in the plan who are going to see the increase will be in the same cost range of folks just getting out of the private program and getting into the public plan in North Carolina and not paying as much as folks that do not want to go into it but they have no choice and they get a break because there is going to be some kind of a family or someone else talking the talk, and that is why we should repeal the law and let all the rate cuts go forward to plan premium increases at an average of 2 percent a year.

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I feel like I am in the middle of a jurisdictional dispute, but I want to respond in kind to what the chairman said about Pennsylvania. This legislation has very little to do with Pennsylvania and much to do with national priorities and resources. The major contribution that the chairman made is accurate. This is one of the reasons why, if I may get this one point across, it is vitally important for us to pass this bill.  AMS is the centerpiece of our infrastructure plan.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the time. Mr. Speaker, this bill very simply allows States to be partners in the Medicaid program. The Federal Government is out of the State's business here, and that is what this bill will allow the States to do by giving them the ability to participate in the Medicaid program so that when they open their doors for the first time in the year there are no burdens that they will be exposed to because the State will have to make the decisions in the Medicaid program for the lower income families that they serve.  This is a responsible thing to do. We need to make sure we do this in a responsible way. We also need to make sure that the Federal taxpayers, Parenthood, those who are disadvantaged and are turning to Medicaid every single year, are not at a tremendous disadvantage, and that they have equal access to health care in this country.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I believe that we are long overdue in taking the proper action to fund our United States Border Patrol. I have heard a lot about immigration reform over the last few years, and the border community has yet to see an immigration reform proposal put forward that is going to solve this problem. It is time to provide some funding to the border patrol so that they can build and provide security along the border so that we can project an appropriate amount of leverage over our northern border so that we can secure this border more quickly for the benefit of American taxpayers and our border personnel.  This bill provides overdue funding for the border patrol. It provides fiscal year 1994 funding of $340 million, and it has been given the authorization to continue to do so through 2002. This does not support a restriction in force of the United States for years to come.  I am looking for a reasonable solution, and I am disappointed in the United States Congress

The manager of the bill has come in and said the part A has been cleared on the Republican side. We were told it was only for the House to consider this and that the Senate might pass it as a part of the tax bill that came out of conference with the House. The Senate would have passed it on the California side and, indeed, the California delegation from that State would have been able to offer it there in the House, as have many other States. It is a long-range agreement on the part of my side. It does deal with postcloture motions and a bill to set up a bankruptcy tribunal. There is no need to delay the final passage of the legislation in the House on that basis.  My colleague from Indiana

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The history of this regulation is as sordid as most of the NLRB's actions in this long history. In short, the actions of the NLRB over the last half century have been to expand its reach in the job training sector to such an extent that the current efforts of the administration to change this rule have become the last-minute goal of the last year before the election.  The last straw for this, as we know, was the National Labor Relations Board's decision to relax the California employee rights section of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 and pass on to our employers statewide a section that was so restrictive that it was even shielded from most State court consideration. In essence, the NLRB arbitrarily narrowed the remedies available to workers to prevent workplace disputes.  The National Labor Relations Board considered its actions fairly and in a timely fashion, and brought before the House a bill that

It is a small bill that allows Congress to achieve its own economic success without creating another $2.5 trillion in the President's fiscal year 2011 budget request.

I believe that most Americans and all who serve in our country have the right to expect their children to receive the high quality education that we have established in this country and that we have the power to increase population and supply of those teachers who will be needed in the future and in the classrooms of this country in an increasingly international economy and this will be an opportunity to make that investment as well as foreign policy of this country.  Congresswoman Beatty and Speaker Hastert had a foresight in 1994 when they formed the National Partnership for International Education and now it has expanded to 170 State and local organizations.

Mr. Speaker, today is the day after Earth Day, and I am one of those Members of Congress from the Republican side who feels that the Republican Party is in the grip of the New World Order that the American people fought so hard to oppose during the 1960s and 1970s and was finally defeated in the 1980s when Congress would not come to the aid of the President in terms of trying to bring about change on the international level and in terms of his being a democrat and in terms of introducing the idea of a welfare state in the United States.  As we look at what this administration is doing, I think it is really fitting for us to reflect on the fact that the United States has never stopped the progression of socialism. And I am sure today that you heard a lot of our colleagues that were on the floor saying the last time that the Congress did something about some of the things that were going on back in the 1940s

It is as simple as that. It says that when we are in a recession, not only do we add to the deficit and debt, we also do so at a cost of money that is revenue neutral.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which, when enacted, will modify the treatment of certain veterans benefits received by veterans who reside in State nursing homes. It has the support of veterans organizations across the country and is supported by a wide variety of health care providers and veterans organizations that benefit from Medicaid and VA treatment.  By definition, nursing homes are receiving veterans treatment in order to maintain a quality health care system. However, this section does not effect the treatment of the seniors residing in State facilities, those located on military bases, and some servicemembers in Federal facilities. These are also receiving the same benefit as VA patients. Rather, what is included in the bill is a joint program designed to try to bring down the cost of health care in our country.  The fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill in the Senate included an amendment to repeal the proposed repeal of the distinction between State-based and Federal-based veterans.

Our constituents do not support using public funds for my amendment because it does not provide enough teeth for Federal policy, which is more inclusive than that in the House-passed version.

Mr. Chairman, I am very disappointed that the Committee on Rules would not allow the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) to be allowed to offer amendments to this legislation which are very important amendments that have not been allowed to be considered on the Rules Committee on the House floor today. That is because the Committee on Rules decided that it is not in the interest of the American public to see how this bill is being voted on in this House. So the Jersey Shore bill which the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) sponsored with Senator Carper was not allowed to be debated by the Committee on Rules or be offered by any of the containment amendments that the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) was seeking to offer in order to achieve, in a straightforward fashion, the release of this entire boatbuilding process in the United States of America.

I thank my colleague from New York, and I thank him for his leadership. I strongly support the minimum wage and I oppose the Bond amendment. This amendment would increase the minimum wage by 10 cents on its current level, and it would be subject to a constitutional amendment that would repeal that increase in the Constitution in favor of a more moderate approach that would allow a `` reform of the income tax system'' that would allow a decision by States to have some flexibility to apply the income tax to minimum wage rates to help pay for minimum wage.  This amendment is incredibly mean spirited. I think every Democrat and every Independent in the Senate would be absolutely outraged and they would be aghast that the White House is taking this amendment to try to do something this important to create jobs and grow our economy. This Congress has made significant progress, and I am very proud of what we have accomplished over the last 5 years. The real question is what

If China, having agreed to the rules on this legislation, after these proceedings had not begun, while the bill was going nowhere, suddenly decides to change the rules that they have agreed to, it could lead us to a situation where we have legitimate trade questions that the Chinese would not like to have brought up, and that means our national security

Instead, they have decided to increase taxes on our most productive and contributing citizens--the poorest of all Americans.  Now they are targeting Social Security benefits for tax cuts.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Hall amendment. There isn't a more vulnerable population out there than children, especially poor children. The food stamp program has been an extraordinary program to help these children who have been in the program for a while and are now struggling. What this amendment does is it makes a change in the program so that the American taxpayer does not subsidize a program which has been so successful. In the future when we increase the amount of money that goes into the supplemental by $40 billion, this program will not be renewed.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I repeat for all Senators that I think we ought to have a good debate on this bill. I think there are things that we can work out and resolve and debate that should not be controversial and that I think we should have good debate on this bill. It is not that we can find some real agreement that we can debate, that the process works, but I think we ought to have a fair and adequate debate on this. It is not so that the Senator from North Dakota will come to the floor and attack me.  I have said this before: I believe in the Senate. I believe in the individual right of all Senators to speak their minds on legislation. I believe in the Senate. I have voted against this bill. I believe it is a silly piece of legislation. I believe that in the Senate, for a group of people on the other side of the aisle to send this to us is irresponsible.

Madam Speaker, I rise with a heavy heart. The two most difficult votes any Member of Congress ever has to cast is to vote to support the law or to vote to break it. I do not agree with that bill on every single one of those votes. I am not for a national education system, but that is what the current system is all about. And it is not a new system. It has been in place for the last 10 years and it has worked well and in a way that the public now wants in this country in office. It is not just a Democratic system. In fact, the same went for this country in World War II in Europe and in Ukraine in the Cold War and that ended.  But the statement that some have made is that because the Democrats would not pass it or have a system for the way it is written, that this Congress will take the matter and see to it that the system is

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the extension of a program that has provided vital support to our Nation's dairy industry for almost three decades. As a Nation that feeds more than 4 million people annually, the ability of our country to meet its growing domestic demand for dairy products is one of the most important issues the United States of America will confront this century and the program is as important to us as the safety of our airline industry is to us today. But it is also the most important question that will face this President this week, on behalf of himself and for the sake of our dairy industry and the farmers who produce the milk that is eaten by almost all Americans.  I stand with my colleagues, Senators Cohen and DeWine, in support of the Agriculture Market Transition and Rural Price Support Extension Act.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment to the Improving America's Schools Act proposed by the Senator from Idaho. The Davis-Bacon Act has been in place for 30 years in this country. The prevailing wage is Federal law for school construction and public school teachers are paid in a competitive wage system. If this legislation is enacted into law, we will see the enactment of a law which will affect the competitiveness of the private sector and especially the public sector education system and particularly those private sector reformers that seek to improve our public education system.  A few years ago, the Federal Trade Commission noted that the Davis-Bacon Act was unable to adequately serve some private industries as it required them to create new positions in new areas in order to be protected from unfair competition.  Mr. President, the Department of Education found that the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act discriminate against private sector teachers. This law used to be much weaker and

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Secretary of Education branded the 2.7 million teacher-strong National Education Association a ``terrorist organization.'' Mr. Paige's words were a hateful comment, and I fear that the Education Department will use this as a cover for their radical agenda in the classroom. The country is very much at a crossroads and it is the job of all of us in this House to ensure that America remains a land of opportunity and not a land of white trash and poverty.  What is most disturbing about the Secretary's words is that she has used the words ``terrorist organization'' just once in her entire career in the Department of Education and beneath the obvious malice of her views. Yet the Department's extremist agenda is nothing new. It is the same agenda that was instrumental in framing the courts in the affirmative action case Brown v. Board of Education.  The Department's general agenda is to do away with our established and democratic school system through its sole concern over the affirmative

Mr. President, 14 years ago, Congress made a grave mistake. In the dead of night, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, Congress passed an act that would make the public bankruptcy system a sham and force those of us in Congress to provide tax benefits for corporations that file tax returns that would otherwise not be subject to tax laws. The provision codified our thinking that corporations should pay taxes based on assets and income rather than on their income taxes or cash reserves. Its effect would be to force businesses to borrow money in order to purchase derivatives. It was blatantly deceptive.  And this amendment says that the same types of wrongheaded tax laws enacted to administer bankruptcy laws should be enacted to act in the public bankruptcy system, a system that is now required under ObamaCare.

Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army SSG Kenneth Locker of Burwell, NE. Sergeant Locker was killed on September 18, 2003 during a military operation in Iraq when he was killed in a parachute jump in Abyan Province of Iraq when he was 35 years old. He was a member of the Airborne Division and had been assigned to the Office of the Secretary of the Army since he graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1989 and was commissioned a fellow in the Air Force staff corps in 1998 after his colleagues at U.S. Air Force Academy first mentioned his name. He is survived by his mother, Kay, and his stepfather, Patrick Locker, a retired U.S. Army sergeant.  Sergeant Locker is survived by his father, who was a member of the Army in Iraq; his mother, one of a series of four siblings; and his sister, two sisters

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3153 and H.R. 2988, the two bills we are considering on the Corrections Day Calendar.  I rise in support of these bills because, as Members of Congress, we have the responsibility to change the laws that have been on the books for a generation so that the rights of the people they are supposed to protect do not get taken away simply because the bills have become outdated.  There are important responsibilities of Members of Congress. They have an important role to play. This bill that I am proud to cosponsor, the Ensuring Public Access to Efficiently Transmitted and Interpreting Corrections Calendar Act of 2009, will help ensure that we have the necessary tools to change the laws that are hurting the people who need help the most.  H.R. 3153 will establish the National Center for Electronic Corrections and make it easier for States to pool information from the EPC database

Mr. President, I do not think we need to get hung up on this at all.

We are working on that now with the President and the majority leader.  There is approximately 6 hours left on the welfare bill. We are working with the minority and working with the Republican leader on a consent agreement. They have indicated they are happy to work with us on that and, indeed, it is our intention in the end to give the minority and the Republican leader a chance to get to their amendments and then decide on final passage.

So where is the criticism of the State of Saudi Arabia?

Mr. Speaker, this body and this Congress should be condemning unlawful withholding, regardless of one's ideology or ideology apostasy.  According to the Treasury Department, Iran had complied with all the conditions of sanctions in 2009 and had obtained a full accounting of Iran's undeclared enrichment of uranium.

The current crisis is the result of a catastrophic military action that has not been authorized by Congress and has an administration that has not been willing to implement a plan to move our Nation from a troubled and unstable situation into a safe and secure one.  It is clear that the decision to deploy thousands of our Armed Forces to a nation whose leaders are very difficult to come by is the most responsible and the most important part of our community's foreign policy.  Our troops are facing a disorganized and, at times, hostile environment.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to see this bill on the floor today. The revitalization of brownfield sites is a central part of the environmental response plan approved by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2001. Ohio has led the Nation in community and economic development in its dealings with financial institutions and companies that had green properties, and communities like Rome are seeing a boom in that activity.  Although not all communities face exactly the same challenges, there are many common challenges shared by all communities and involve new investment in clean energy. As part of this environment and environmental community reinvestment, communities across the country have recognized that by aggressively pursuing green building and biofuels, and by better coordinating their own efforts with the Federal Government, they can reverse the decline in their investment in these local industries. In fact, red States like Michigan have been more successful than green States in converting to this greening lifestyle and are demonstrating the

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 953, Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017.

This legislation also requires agencies to enter into a national plan that would also establish a legal framework within which these individual separate activities can take place without hindering an agency's ability to achieve the executive branch-approved executive process with respect to executive agency executive nominations and executive executive agency executive board chairman appointments.  This legislation would clearly lead to more efficiency in the administrative process.

Madam Speaker, last week, the Sunshine State was devastated by the 393rd mass shooting of 2019. On December 6, a gunman opened fire at the Federal building in Santa Ana, California. That mass shooting killed 27 people and injured 26 others.  The shooter had been accused of committing five separate hate crimes since being released from prison in the early hours of January 9. He was also twice detained by the police for allegedly threatening a speaker at a Planned Parenthood clinic in the South Bay and allegedly assaulting three police officers in El Cajon.  We were shocked by the senseless loss of life and robbed of lives, but we are not immune to some of the terrorism in our communities. The influx of illegal immigration has created a separate environment for hate.

Madam President, the war in Iraq is the greatest challenge facing our country. Unfortunately, the political debate in Washington has not been conducive to finding a more responsible, constructive solution to this conflict. While Senator Paul has offered a thoughtful and comprehensive plan to protect and rebuild Iraq, the majority leader has insisted that any comprehensive plan must also include increased funding for the mission to keep our troops in the field. The amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from New Mexico will help address the problem and will help focus this critical initiative in the same way that the study on our troop drawdown bill did in 2001.  The amendment I have been considering with Senator Paul would authorize funding for the initial troops to be deployed in Iraq, with 25 percent of that funding immediately being provided by the Defense Department itself.  This amendment would be a far cry from the approach of the 2001 Washington study, which directed our troops to receive a reduced level of funds over time from year

We, on behalf of myself and others, have been here quite a few days this week talking about what we think this health care bill really does to people in the way it affects some of the things we think it really does to people around this country as well as what it really does to people when it comes to making sure we have good quality and that we have good quality debate about what kind of health care we want for our people in our country. I think we have done that very well and we have really gotten things going here in what I think is really kind of kind of really good things really going here really going really good lot in this process.  But just in response to a couple of things, it seems to me there is some confusion about what the differences are with respect to the issue that is before us now with

Mr. President, it would not. I am advised by the Parliamentarian that it would not be subject to a point of order because it relates to legislation that did not come to the floor for a vote before the constitutional amendment to allow for a balanced budget was taken to the Senate. So it would not be subject to a point of order because it did not come to the floor for a vote before that was taken to allow for a constitutional amendment to allow for a balanced budget was decided.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>                                 {23}<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, my friend from New York claims this is not political. Forty-five minutes ago he, under the direction of his leadership, with the passionate leadership of Senator D'Amato, said that it is that we should allow the committee to look at this question of fraud that took place in the last election as to who really was responsible for that fraud, because that is what the claims are to this Congress. That is why he voted with us on the confirmation of Mr. Foster to be Ambassador to Cuba, to be Ambassador to Ethiopia, and to be Ambassador to Iraq. He voted with us on the nominations of Ms. Barkett and Mr. Jacobson, and I had no objection. We think these were meritorious nominations.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1775, the Stolen Valor Act of 2011, and urge its passage. I would like to thank my good friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling), the ranking member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Committee and author of this legislation.  This bill has many good provisions. The focus of the bill is to honor our servicemembers who, at the grave risk of their own lives, volunteer to fight for our freedoms. It recognizes their bravery, and that they gave their lives for this country. That should not surprise us. Alvarez, McHenry, and Archer each earned World War II veteran status, and was the only combat veteran of their respective service branch. The Federal Government already places honor posthumously in the next generation's honor rolls, and it is our responsibility to acknowledge their achievements in a timely manner. H.R. 1775 provides that duty and

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and just in the closing minutes, I would say that also it is important for people to know that this discussion that you and I are having just the other night and others that are engaged in this have in fact come up with a substitute that is much more practical that has no interest in trying to come up with a new definition for the word `` compound interest `` when in fact there is just one time when you just do not have that definition and you just just put the word out there. So I just wanted to make it clear that we just want to put out this minutes with not one word on both sides, but we have come up with a difference of about 10 percent in terms of the number of time you can waste by getting the word ``new'' mixed in with the existing definition that you have in this bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I thank the House leadership for scheduling action on this important legislation. It is designed to stiffen and standardize the penalties for folks who violate health standards that are mandated under this legislation, and also to allow Federal authorities to enforce them if they are violated by people in this country and people who have regulated them and allowed them to be in existence here in the United States of America for a period of time, not just years and years and years but years and years to come and then the health standards are just unenforceable and they are human rights violations that have to be addressed and addressed now because people who have come here through no fault of their own and who have been told to abide by Chairman Shuster and those who have been given authority are not at this point safe from these kind of activities, and it is time for them to pay a penalty to this Chamber and to the Federal Government.  I want to thank Chairman

Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the first time since 2002 to see if it can serve as a force multiplier for our agricultural economy and as a welfare measure that puts food on the table for many who will benefit from it the most. Last year Congress passed legislation that was not only legislation to serve as a nationwide welfare bill but as a farm bill because at least half of the dollars that were in the bill came from agriculture. It is only due to a good number of people that this average number actually exceeded last year in some years compared to previous years because percentages of $10, $25, $50, $75, and $100 were always what worked in a welfare bill.  This measure, H.R. 3354, requires that agriculture and its livestock producers have a number of incentives that can support both, long-term income and the well-being of their family

Reclaiming my time, I agree with the gentleman. Whatever you call this bill, on this side of the aisle it is still the Clinton plan, no big changes.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I urge adoption of this rule and a ``no'' vote on the previous question so that we can bring up the conference report and the health care bill that we will be offering at some point in the near future to keep this country going for our families and this country to keep it going for the people that call this our country.  I would like to again join with the gentleman from Illinois in saying that this really is a way that we can lead our people to believe that this Congress cares about them, about our families, and this Congress is going to do what is right. We can do it with this rule. We can do it with this health care bill that we will be offering at some point in

Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues back to the Senate. I hope all of us took advantage of the past weeks that we spent in the district that we are now returning to and getting back to working on a bipartisan basis and governing in a bipartisan way for the people of our country. We have a lot of people who are here who have been political prisoners, and I am glad to see some of them out and working in good faith with the Republican leadership here in the Senate. I certainly hope that everyone who goes back and gets to a Johnny-come-lately, they will come home, I hope, with that smile on their face and want to help with the recovery of the people of this country and help make sure that we pass a good agenda that actually gets done.

Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued its ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the largest defense contracts in history: the Air Force's decision to lease 20 F-16s in exchange for plane-by-plane orders of American military aircraft from General Atomics. While the GAO recognized that Congress cannot ``unequivocally and unequivocally approve of contracting in this and other Federal government procurement activities that involve fiscal authority under statute and oversight accountability standards,'' the GAO also asserted that in this instance the issues raised by Congress ``were not of real substance.'' We also find that the Department of Defense has been advised by the GAO of the obstacles to completion and coordination of these contracts.  The Air Force has refused to return to work on these F-16 orders. Boeing says that after close consultation with the contractor, this company has decided to spend at least $2 billion on the purchase and construction of these planes. At this rate, the
