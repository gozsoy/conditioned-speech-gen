Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP remains below 5 percent over the next 5 years. In 1993 we passed Bill Clinton's tax cut proposal which would not have raised the tax rate on the American people by more than $1 billion over the next 5 years and would have increased the deficit by over $30 billion. These high tax rates and this fiscal crisis the Congress has created is still going on today and is creating a huge economic crisis for this country and for future generations.  Mr. Chairman, there is a way to cut our deficit and deal with the deficit in a fair and balanced manner. I have offered an amendment which would eliminate and eliminate the $1 billion in tax cuts and the $30 billion in budget deficit for the next 5 years. This is not a new proposal. This has been done in

state ban alabama

There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban in Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that that was unconstitutional, and now Alabama is in a state of emergency because that law remains in effect. There has been an attempt to repeal that law by the Senate, but there was no attempt to enact it by the House of Representatives as a State constitutional amendment, and now we have an attempt to repeal that law by an act of the Congress that is approved by a very, very small majority in the Senate but which nevertheless could bring thousands of our citizens to be put in jail because this law which passed in Alabama would be in effect and would violate our pledge to uphold the laws of this land. It was very dangerous to our State and the Constitution. This State constitutional amendment would prevent that from happening and would put thousands of our citizens in jail.

Mr. Speaker, today I would like to address an issue that affects all of our families: the pay gap between men and women in our society. The pay gap means that women are paid less than their male counterparts for doing the same work. This situation is so bad that nearly half of all women will have to give up their current jobs if they wanted to stay at home and support their families.  We must do something to close this pay gap and get women back to work and back to the work force that we want them to be in in the future. We must offer pay raises to those who need them the most, our men and our women who will need them the most when they retire. And we must also increase the number of women in the workforce so that they can earn more when they leave that work force.

This budget amendment establishes a commission on taxes, a bipartisan task force that will meet for 1 year to discuss the tax proposal contained in the conference report on the deficit reduction bill. Based on this commission's findings, the Senate must pass a budget resolution which will prevent the deficit from growing further in the future.

Mr. President, in addition, I would like to clarify the intentions of the Fund for Peace in Israel of the United States to provide additional funding for the Yasser Arafat Fund for Peace. The Fund is seeking to provide authorization for additional funding for the Palestinian Authority to assist in the implementation of the United States Conference on Peace Plan IV concerning Israel and for other purposes. The Fund's report to the Appropriations Committee requests authorization for the use of its $15 million appropriation for this purpose. As authorized by the Simon-Kerrey amendment of the FY02 budget resolution, the $15 million of the $17 million appropriation for this purpose would be for an endowment to support operations of the Palestinian Authority to increase their capacity to support those programs that support nonviolence, education, health care, social services, and the reconstruction of homes destroyed during

So I just want to point that out because that is the most important part that we are talking about here today.  Let me also reiterate, though, the point that the gentleman has just made, that this is about working families, that this is about parents, that this is about children.

But he also knows the importance of the Budget Committee, so this is not the first time he has addressed this issue. In fact, he has repeatedly addressed it over the last week and this morning. So I am not interested in making a partisan issue about that. I want to understand what the issue is and will continue to be about it in the months ahead.  It is our hope that the time taken to lay down the Glenn substitute can be split with the first meeting of the Budget Committee and the second meeting having our session tomorrow morning and that the amendments to the substitute can be considered in order to avoid a repeat of what has happened during the last

cbo millions loss 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, included in the Democrats' health plan are massive cuts to Medicare Advantage that are the first loss of coverage for millions of seniors in this country.  The Democrat plan also eliminates the Community Services Block Grant, which funds many of the programs that help reduce costs for many seniors. I am not saying they are bad programs, but the block grant budget cuts these programs in half.  Now, the Democrats want to cut Medicaid, Medicare, and Medicaid Plus by nearly $2 billion, leaving over 24 million Americans below Medicaid services. Why?  I think this cuts is too broad. With nearly 2 million Americans, CBO projected an average coverage gap for 2012 of 27.4 percent, meaning 13 million individuals could lose coverage, over 36 million.  Mr. Speaker, if Congress is serious about reducing healthcare costs, we must pass

This legislation will promote greater flexibility and decrease the amount of time workers have to spend in the middle of the night at the pump. Under current law, workers are forced to work a quarter of the day and 6 percent of the total week to provide a paycheck to their employer.

Madam President, I announced this morning, though only Senator McConnell and I were on the floor to make the announcement, Senator McConnell earlier today reached out to my staff, and we reached out to the managers of this bill to see if we could make sure it was possible to schedule a unanimous-consent request for our amendments with a time certain for the vote to occur at 4 p.m. But we can't do that with the legislation just before us, so I just want to let my colleagues know. We will get back to you on it.  I have another request to make. I think it was just over a week ago that the White House indicated they were preparing to veto the three bills that they had offered to add $2.6 billion for housing in the first 11 months of this fiscal year.

Madam President, George Washington once said of the Nation's flag, and I quote, ``Let us not use the gold standard to justify the adoption of a high treason to American pride symbol that is overblown.'' Washington in the 1820s was to help break the link between native Americans and the glory of the land.  But until recent years, the Flag Protection Act was quite different from other Federal laws regarding flag desecration. In past years, the Flag Protection Act has simply protected the views of its authors, and provided protection from judicial interference to those who seek to politicize the Capitol.  This is a time of such political turmoil that we simply cannot allow political interference in the lives of Members and staff of this Chamber.  We need to respect the views of those Members and staff who feel passionately about the Constitution of the United States of

As we weaken those standards, as we have this wide-open trade arrangement with a host of countries that I have just pointed out in a number of places, we are trying to really keep this economy more competitive in this country and to make sure that America is able to compete internationally in terms of products that we make and products that we make.  We are losing manufacturing capacity.

My position is it not be used. The budget--so far we had in the Budget Committee 10 hearings and the budget which we adopted in this context with the agreement of the Senator from Maine that the resolution would not have such a provision and that it would be a problem to prevent the budget from taking effect, that it be something that is carefully considered and it would be necessary to further define the meaning of the word ``purpose.'' But this does not mean that I accept this action by the Budget Committee, because I think it is unfair to our actions in this process.  I can understand the position that the Senator from Massachusetts wishes to take. It certainly seems fair to me. If you have just a relatively small budget, that means that if the Government is raided by the Government of Japan, it means that the Government of China is raiding

She is the first of the six new judges nominated by President Obama this week to serve on the Federal courts in the eastern part of the country.  Over the past three Congresses, President Obama has sent nominees to the committee for a full hearing in which they can be offered and debated before a vote on final confirmation. That process should continue under this administration, as it should under the previous two Presidents.  That is why, in the Judiciary Committee today, the Republicans and I will conduct a two-day hearing on the nominee to the Ninth Circuit, Bridget Bade.

But those few fans who watched the game for the most part were left with two thoughts: If there is one thing that the city of Green Bay has learned since the Super Bowl, it is that playing football is a very rewarding way to spend a weekend away from the grind of life. There are few things more rewarding than a chance to travel around the world and meet and to watch the players of the NFL. There are few things more rewarding than watching the NFL team play in their own city.  The last week before the Super Bowl I had a chance to get to know some of the players and to see what the atmosphere was like before

Mr. President, I have some comments. They will be short, but I will save them for a couple of paragraphs. The Senator has been concerned about the bill before us tonight, S. 1511, which deals with what we call ``secondary aircraft.'' We were there in spring to take a look at it in March. We would have been here before that, but it was before the recess and there was a good process on both sides of the aisle in the Senate that dealt with these kinds of issues. So I would not have thought that the Senator from Arizona would have come to the floor and expressed his outrage about the process that is in place now that we are dealing with these secondary aircraft. It is a great compliment to those who went through the motions with regard to this and voted for this and now are concerned about something that is

Madam President, I know there are others waiting to speak. I don't want to delay further the debate on the pending legislation. It has been the desire of this Senate to keep this bill pending for as long as we possibly can delay it. We hope that has been brought to a conclusion in the next few minutes. I ask that I be allowed to speak for 15 minutes with regard to the pending amendment.  The  plugged-out question is whether we should proceed to debate the pending legislation that is pending on the pending amendment and, if so, whether we should proceed to the specific amendment of the Senator from Missouri which the Senator from California and others are discussing.  That amendment concerns the merger of Interstate 71 and Interstate 73.

While I believe it is imperative that this country continues to move forward on its economic recovery plan, this is not the first time that the United States has failed to do this. In the 1960s, the government turned its backs on the people of this country as a result of a balanced budget that we inherited from the previous generation.  We have to be very much aware that we have to return to this balance before it is too late for our people. We should not be able to do so while we are watching the deficit grow in record amounts.

Mr. Speaker, today I would like to draw public attention to a great miscarriage of justice in Massachusetts and to the American Civil Liberties Union.  A month and a half ago, Federal authorities raided and seized the house of a 22-year-old woman for fighting to register her vote. As anyone knows, Massachusetts is one of seven States that requires all citizens to register with the Federal Government. The decision by the Attorney General to issue a Federal registration to the woman for voting in a partisan election was a blatant and unfair violation of the Massachusetts Constitution. I believe that the Massachusetts court had no choice but to grant her request for review by the State Supreme Court in order to secure judicial review and vindicate the rights of all voters.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Justice Department to review the decision and to enter into a settlement agreement

You can go right down to the bank and say we want to help you out, because you are the one that is going to raise taxes on the very rich. Or if you agree with what the Clintons do, and it is the Government's responsibility to care for its own citizens, Bill Clinton has proposed a tax increase which will be less than $300 billion to put people to work. I can imagine if that is what the American people want to hear, they would join hands and support Bill Clinton as their President.  This budget continues that trend which he has

It says ``40 million additional beneficiaries will be required to purchase Medicare coverage.''  So I think it is the right thing to do.

It is important that we fully implement the public safety provisions of the bill and have the time to have that implemented in a way that is fair to both the law-abiding public as well as to the Government so that law enforcement can better protect its communities and its citizens from this scourge of crime and terrorism which has been so brutal to our Nation's children and the public who look after them for years.

We do not need to go through that bill any further because the Republicans who are negotiating that bill know what they want to do to the American economy.

That vote was taken, however, back in January of 1993.

It requires the President to submit to Congress a specific plan for how he or she will pay for the cost of government operations beyond the current level of nearly $4 trillion.  For too long the current fiscal policy has failed to keep pace with the ever-increasing spending demands that we have been subjected to over the past two decades.

And if we can, I will not be as specific as to what the full text of the amendment will be or if it will be a clear cut effort to take from this small amount that is designated in this conference report or from the proposed levels of that amount, perhaps in other words just something like the same amount that the President of the United States would have received in his pay raise before that could be given to the Cabinet Secretaries and other personnel in the executive branch or possibly many others who might have the same goal in mind that this individual in question would have to accomplish the same level of work.  If the Senator from Michigan does not mind yielding for a question, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for a question as well.

Madam President, I rise today to offer this amendment because I am concerned about the Congressional Budget Office report regarding the CBO estimate of the President's Fiscal Year 2006 budget request for VA construction and related services and the higher level of defense spending requested by the President for this budget. The report states that the VA will spend $2 billion more in fiscal year 2006 than requested by the Pentagon and that this higher level of funding will increase the current fiscal year 2006 level of VA construction by approximately $89 million over the next 7 years. If the President increases the budget request for the VA in the future fiscal year, the figures contained in this report will increase even further because higher funding levels are expected in the future years as a result of increased demands for the VA's operations and maintenance account.

The tax reconciliation bill is in conference. I know there have been some discussions. From what I have read in the press it is looking very good. I think we can certainly work something out on this tax bill this year and I hope the other body will help us do that.  If you read the rest of the tax bill is to be sent over, the sum of $650 billion over the next 10 years is in there that makes up the tax bill itself and it will be important in the future to have those tax cuts that are in there. I do not want to speculate how this tax bill is received because there is no way to know for sure but the impression that I have gotten is that the tax bill is not a tax bill.

This resolution is about the lives of the courageous Americans who, in the course of the campaign and a week of political drama at the end of last year, fought for the ultimate among many things. These Americans fought to stop a dictator from taking power in Libya while we fought back in the Middle East against growing international hostility toward our Nation. We also fought against the brutal, brutal attacks of Boko Haram extremists that brought so many Americans to the brink of tragedy last year. We fought to rebuild America's infrastructure in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 while we fought to defend our country in the wake of the terror attacks of the War on Terror.

For many years, the Department of Defense has sponsored the Children's Resource Center in my home State of Arizona. Children who were abused at the center or others in the community do not have the hearing, social skills, or other development resources to succeed in school and other adult roles. The Children's Resource Center helps address these deficiencies.  As in all major legislation, this one has had to pass on an up-or-down vote, but this one, the bill before us, represents tremendous progress.  Most families know someone who has been victimized by childhood abuse. And children who live in foster care, this bill ensures that the State of Arizona may

This is an effort to enable the Army National Guard to better support the military forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in Operation New Dawn as well as Combat Training and Basic Readiness Centers that are located at Fort Riley, Kansas, and Fort Benning, Georgia.

Despite our personal disagreement over the constitutionality of the new constitution, we should be together in calling for an end to the occupation of Iraq so that the people of Iraq can have a government that could be able to provide a good future to their people.

Our Nation's cultural heritage depends on two main ingredients--historic preservation and protection of the Nation's most valuable natural resource resources.  I see it as equally important that we preserve and protect these resources and protections, and that we work toward a cost-effective solution.  Congress has considered the budget resolution and the construction of these parks and monuments in several well-developed studies.

The Fed and EPA will soon report to Congress on how much the regulations cost small businesses in New York, Illinois, Virginia, and 29 other States in a 13-month period and the impact on nearly 816,000 small business owners in 26 States nationwide.  The 29 States in my home State of California would be forced to cancel 20 percent of the 13-month period of the post-school loan program for a 10 percent price increase, and the Federal Government may soon ban the loan in 17 States.

So the Government then financing and selling the business--and it is not a government issue in many ways. There is a public sector component to it.

We recognize the sacrifices the administration has made in order to meet their funding obligations. However, we also know that the administration will be in the position of having to begin cutting back some of its planned discretionary spending programs in order to meet the Federal Government's budget obligations in the next year or two. This is certainly not a reason to take significant cuts in programs that the administration does support and would like to continue to provide to our Nation in the future.  In addition, we also know that the administration is aware of the resources and expertise provided by Congress to deal with the resolution of international conflicts and for other purposes.

The amendment also makes clear that the Secretary may not use such funds for any purpose other than the construction of these buildings that violate the nonpoint of view approach proposed in section 11 of this bill. Therefore, this amendment does not ban the construction of any such structure or structure change that does not use a Federal property rights claim as a reason for the construction of such structure.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Mr. Crapo for managing the bill today and for making it so that I can take this time to thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee for including our bill. I will mention some other things that were not made in the bill in the last few days, and I am confident this bill will be able to improve the current situation that Members are faced with, but also to improve the bill as a whole as well.  First and foremost, I would like to thank Mr. Crapo for the work he has done as the ranking member and also as chairman of the Committee on Commerce for making sure that there is a clear message that we are working toward in terms of the information about where this company is going and what this company is doing.

I would like to point out it is not only education where we are looking at job training that is being cut or the money is being cut to States to meet the needs of the hungry in this country. There is also the opportunity funding for infrastructure such as roads that need to be built, money to fix our roads and bridges and make sure that we have security when we travel to work and when we come home. Those are the things we are looking at the budget that is coming down from the Republicans to try to put those dollars where they should be spending on this nation of ours.   ticket items do have an ability to keep money out of the mouths of Americans that really are not getting some of the money that they are getting, just because they are wealthier than average Americans that are experiencing the rate of increase in the

Well, in order to move forward in that way in our nation it is much more important to know whether or not the people around us in that community are going to help us in terms of our programs and policies and that kind of thing because one of the biggest factors that people always have that is impacting people is what their level of income is and what their level of services and their level of education is and the role they play in their communities in terms of how those things get processed and

I thank the gentleman. My concern is that when we did the earmark reform rule, there were a number of earmark reform bills that were not adopted and that would have been held up had there been a bill at that time that would have been developed as a bipartisan bill that would have been able to be adopted with bipartisan support. It would have passed overwhelmingly, and that would have been the way that we would have been able to address the issue of these earmarks. So it is very difficult for me to believe that in this Congress that they would let these three bills go through the committee process without any earmark reform.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California [Mr. Hunter], who has been one of the leaders in getting an earmark reform bill passed into law, I do believe,

It would also, I would say to the chairman, put us back a step further on the fundamental issue of social welfare.  My amendment would raise the Social Security contribution for retirees from $1,500 to the current level of $3,250. That is $2,500 above the current level. The increase would not apply to the immediate benefits that have been discussed today because those benefits are exempt from the Social Security contribution to be paid as of the date of the enactment of the bill. So it would be in effect exempt from the contribution that is required under the bill because

I think it is clear that the effect of this will be to continue the regime that we have in place today where we have too many Federal Government regulations that prevent citizens from doing what they want to do and putting them in the back of the line of Federal regulations that they find necessary to live their lives without any guarantee that they would get to live their lives in a way that is meaningful and that is sustainable. This is a small step for that. But this has the tremendous impact that this would have on the ability of the people in the middle of this war zone in Iraq to continue to have jobs, pay their taxes, and be able to take care of their families. This amendment is a significant step forward for our national security but it will not move us very far on the war on terror when this Congress fails to adequately

I would only say the amendment does not strike from this bill the language that the White House has used to increase funding for this block grant and that I would not support the bill. But I do believe that this amendment would be wrong. It would weaken the ability of this House to make this very important decision of whether or not to not allow the Army Corps of Engineers to carry out its most important responsibility to Congress and the American people to keep the Nation safe from disasters and to protect the people who have been in need of that service, which is protecting their public lands that they have been given, their American property that they have been given to protect their property that they believe that it is their moral obligation to protect.

I would point out that the Republican bill proposes to lay off 5,000 people at the same time the Democrats have proposed the increase of $130 billion to the Department of Agriculture. So it is not just budget or personnel or State and local government that would be affected. It is so important that the American people see that.

But the President of the United States is still trying to use the debt ceiling crisis to justify his $4 trillion tax increase plan to raise taxes for 98 million middle-income Americans and to spend $120 billion more than last year on defense. If the President of the United States is serious about trying to take away the middle class's ability to go to the store for their groceries, why does he not want to take that $4 trillion tax increase on the backs of middle-class Americans and prevent them from going to the store for their groceries?

Since that time, the country has received much more attention to the war on terror, the personal security of our men and women in uniform, the safety of our communities. Yet, it is important to note that in many ways we have not taken the war on terror seriously enough. According to the FBI, the United States is now the number one terrorism threat to the United States of America.

The underlying bill for the National Highway System is not responsible to the people of this country and is really legislation to rubberstamp one railroad over another. The proponents of this legislation ignore the needs of citizens to move goods and passengers. They want a transportation system that is light-years ahead of how it is today and not a system that goes back to the days of air traffic control that caused accidents. Many people believe that there is no alternative to trying to regulate passenger and freight traffic. However, I believe this report will slow down the movement of goods and passenger

It has been a long week for the Senate. Several nominees received high marks in committee and in the Armed Services Committee, but the Academy of Science was not treated as much.  According to the magazine Science, the Academy was awarded the top favorable score on rules, the top favorable score on population issues, and the top unfavorable score on ranking.  Mr. President, in less than two weeks, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Christine Todd Whitman. Christine Todd Whitman's three pages outline a vision of a new America.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation introduced by our colleague from North Carolina, Representative Guthrie.  This is a very simple measure that was introduced in committee and was adopted as part of the Fish and Wildlife Service Reauthorization Act last Congress. It would direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to complete a study of the effects of unauthorized introductions of rats and other invertebrates, rodents, into Florida in an effort to determine whether this situation could be mitigated. I think it is important to note that this bill is bipartisan in nature. It has the support of both parties. In fact, this bill was unanimously passed by the House Agriculture Committee last Congress, and was signed into law by President Bush.  I believe that our chairman, the gentleman from Ohio

We have failed in that effort to reduce the growth of the Federal Government and to stop what has become a monstrous amount of Federal spending in States and local governments across the Nation as well as in the Federal Government itself. I think it is very important for us to act this week to say to Republicans that we have to defeat the last effort that Senator Grassley and the House Democrats have made to control the growth of the Federal Government by overturning an overreaching amendment that has been agreed to by Republicans and Democrats and over which

Mr. Speaker, currently, in the House Judiciary Committee, there is an unusual spectacle unfolding. Now, during the month of October in the House of Representatives Speaker Gingrich has said he will cut this special program in order to protect Republicans against a Medicare Part B cut. The price of the year 2007 would surely be less than it was for the last two Presidents in terms of the marginal benefit available to seniors. The cost of prescription drugs is about double what it was for the last two Presidents.  For a variety of reasons, almost every Member of this body now agrees that we have seen an inappropriate shift of power to a special interest, the insurance industry. What has become clear this week is that if it is going to get too far on the appropriation of the Omnibus Appropriations Act to block a Medicare Cut Act, Speaker Gingrich is at least as good a

Once the war is over, over $300 billion will be required to support Iraq and Iraqi reconstruction efforts. These resources will be a disproportionate burden for Iraqis and Americans.  But this House must not ignore the Iraqis who will live under Saddam's tyrannical regime.

All that the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight should be required to report to the full House is a range of information about the select committee that would not be provided by this resolution. Such a simple measure would send a message to the select committee that the select committee has no resources to ensure that the needs of the intelligence community are adequately funded in the future.

Thousands of Hawaii homes remain without power as the massive power failure continues to threaten their homes and communities. Additionally, the State has been under the rule of law for days as Hawaiian officials have failed to grant the city of Honolulu the ability to plan for the massive losses which they have been experiencing for over 2 weeks now.

I would say to the chairman, I think the allocation of time has already taken place and that there is a fair and strong vote in that regard and the American people will be voting on this matter very soon on the point of order. But it is still my hope, and I see it is the gentleman's hope, that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, we understand, that that is an example of a bill that could be part of a very important budget resolution next year and not be part of this appropriations bill.  I would like to yield at this time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is time to cut the government spending and give the people of America the things they want and need today instead of worrying about how the next election is going to be the next year in the same way that it was last year.

The proposal before us today strengthens existing safeguards and makes new commitments to the States and communities most vulnerable to environmental degradation.

Mr. Speaker, the Wall Street Journal reports that by almost a 3-to-1 margin, the American people said Wall Street was a real problem and that they believe it is changing. If Congress gets its act together and looks to the well and begins to tax Wall Street speculation and manipulation, we will not only begin to succeed in the war on Wall Street, but we will be succeeding in a broader war on Wall Street.  The Journal also notes that 52 percent of Republicans agreed that reform is needed, and 75 percent agreed that Congress should act now to change the way that Wall Street is doing business.  The President's fiscal year 1996 budget cuts taxes on both financial transactions and derivatives by close to $1 trillion over 5 years, and by 2011 Congress must also pass legislation that means that the President is willing to spend the money on commonsense reform.

Mr. Speaker, $5 trillion of debt, $200 billion deficits, $187,000 in interest debt for a group of American families. We are borrowing twice as much money as the Federal Government is asking to pay back the debt this year. At a time when our deficits have increased by 25 percent in the last 3 years alone, Congress has failed to respond. With Social Security running out of money, even we are borrowing more than we are taking in to balance the budget.  Even though the Bush administration argues for more borrowing, President Clinton would do the exact opposite, and that is raise taxes and slash spending. He wants to save more for war in Iraq and then tax a bunch of people to pay for it. But we cannot increase taxes and balance the budget, we need to balance the budget.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, drug prices can be higher in some cases for consumers than in other States. The Department of Health and Human Services has been spending considerable effort to address the problem by lowering drug prices in the United States. Some States have seen the benefits in decreasing health care costs for Americans while others have not yet seen a benefit from the steps taken to address drug costs that have been taken in the first half of this year and into the second half of this year. The fact that the Federal Government has worked so hard to address the problem of the growing price of drugs is a step in the right direction but there is much more that needs to be done to make it a full participation in the United States market for the most important economic component in our society, the American worker. That is why I will be introducing a bill with my colleague

Then they had to turn it over to the State to be paid and spent money on other things. It was a very expensive case for them and all it cost them was a little bit of money, but the State is not happy with the fact that there is no dispute on the appeal, and they are not happy with the fact that the trial was taken away because of this kind of thing.  The reality is the State of New York can recover just about anything that they want to recover from a defendant they think has been responsible for those particular acts that have been committed. That is not the case with Federal law.

Sergeant Tucker is the first Vietnam vet from Pascagoula to go on Active Duty and the first from the State of Mississippi to ever have served in that important post. Prior to his tour in Vietnam, he also served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the Korean war and during Desert Storm in 1991 and again in October 2003 as a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. At 22 years old, he was deployed to Afghanistan on January 8 and July 10 of 2006 and is now 29 years old.

We have another vote in this Congress right now that I am proud to support, but we have to take a long hard look at what coalition budgets do to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The Democrats and Republicans agree that, after trillions of dollars of budget deficits over the last 8 years, entitlement programs should not only be reformed, but that they need to be modernized to keep pace with inflation.  We agree that Social Security is an entitlement program. Under this coalition budget, the Social Security trustees estimate that the tax cuts provided to senior citizens in the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security benefits that they have paid into for 30 years will cost

Madam Speaker, the majority has already explained the purpose of H.R. 233, which was introduced in the House with bipartisan support on February 3, 2003. The bill is named for Iain Duncan Smith, the former chairman of the Budget Committee and former Governor of the State of Texas who was a hero to all of us at the time. I want to commend and recognize the efforts of the chairman and all Members of the Budget Committee who worked so hard and thoughtfully to get this bill to the floor today and, most importantly, I want to thank the leadership of the House for bringing it to the floor today.  Madam Speaker, the chairman has provided an excellent bill with major reform provisions to begin addressing the devastating situation in Texas and the Nation. We must learn from his experience and recognize that the bill also has major shortcomings. It could

One of the biggest choices facing lawmakers is whether to vote to increase the debt limit to pay for Republican tax breaks or to cut taxes for middle-class Americans to help grow our economy and put people back to work. That is how politics works.  We should reject these tax cuts for the rich for just one reason: Because they do nothing to help create jobs. And not one Republican will talk about reducing the tax burden on middle-class Americans, and they claim that increasing the debt limit simply will give more tax breaks to the rich. In fact, Republicans have called for additional increases in the Federal minimum wage and a higher education tax credit. Even President Obama has proposed cutting back on the credit for struggling families, calling it a ``slush fund'' that would help ``effectively prevent

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system that ignored the needs of its own citizens would, in effect, fail. The creation of the Federal Food Stamp Program in 1932 set in motion what would become the American welfare state of the 1960s and the current welfare state in the early 1980s. In a long debate on reform, Franklin Roosevelt concluded that the welfare system needed to be overhauled. Without the FSP, the number of Americans receiving assistance would have tripled during the next 20 years.  The FSP was founded with the President's assurance that when he became President in 1968, he would veto any attempt to eliminate or change the FSP. That pledge was kept by the Republicans in the 1970s, and their actions back then put the safety net, which helped millions of poor families

Mr. Speaker, this bill very much, I think for the last time in history on this floor, has a different purpose in that it was put together last month as a compromise with a number of other groups on a number of important issues that the Democratic Party has been concerned about the last several months that this is not in a consensus-building package to be passed later this week by the Congress and the President of the United States. We are not debating this in a bipartisan fashion or a kind of a Senate kind of fashion. We are debating this in a really rather closed way on an issue that Members on both sides of the aisle have a very strong concern about and that many Members on both sides of the aisle believe strongly in that this is not the appropriate way to go with what

The House has made progress with regard to trade and it has been a bipartisan effort. But this particular bill before us today is not the kind of bill that can work the way it should because it is only one bill that is only relevant to one field of the Federal Government. We could make a tremendous difference in the world if we had all of the information that is going to be required of every single sector of this country which will be required to deal with this subject matter, the subject matter of just the United States of America and its trade with every single State in the country and the State of every other State.

Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is really misstating what the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt] said. It is important to remember that the authorization that expired on October 1 did not authorize this new, much more extensive and sweeping law. It was a multiyear authorization for a long time that could only be renewed in terms of authorization. The only one that allows us to break the law is the consent decree from the past couple of years. They do not allow for this to be a part of it until very late in the year when we finally do get the final 5-year authorization that is just before us. The only difference between what the gentleman from Missouri says and what the gentleman from New Jersey says is the right in the contract is about what it is in the previous 5-year period of time to break that agreement with the States for that money

Mr. Chairman, I oppose this McClintock amendment because it sounds like a solution in search of a problem. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reason is that if we raise the minimum wage on its own, it will be paid for by the increased tax revenues to help reduce the Federal deficit by a factor of 3 to 1, with little to no purpose beyond the individual tax reductions which would be permanent, and only if those tax cuts are not renewed could the increase in the minimum wage actually be offset by those tax cuts. We need to increase the minimum wage and strengthen the U.S. economy by lifting all workers out of poverty and improving their lives.  Mr. Chairman, this would be a dramatic step to allow a single-family home to be paid for with funds in the regular and mandatory budget accounts to help our

Having said that, to our knowledge no decisions have been made yet on the first permit so I think that there should be an opportunity to work out those issues and those things that are within the jurisdiction of the State of Minnesota to be able to make those decisions with respect to the pipeline and to enable those as necessary to make the decision as to whether or not that should proceed to the state that has already given the order to the State of Minnesota to go ahead and do the pipeline there.

It is beyond me how this administration could have been so deceptive in explaining the United Nations' decisions. It is no wonder Americans are fearful that Iraq could be a source of instability and conflict again, and that the war could well continue to be the death knell of our efforts to create a peaceful democracy there.

This is a very significant time for the Nation in terms of providing support for women and children. I thank the staffs of the Ways and Means Committee and of the Appropriations Committee and also the ranking members of the committees that have worked so hard to make this bill possible. We have just had the same number of Democratic votes in this last year as we had in the past years.

I believe that it is important to clarify one thing that I think the administration has been saying and that is the issue of privatizing procurement, and the administration wants to see that it is done in a way that is reasonable and respectful of taxpayers and the ability to negotiate in good faith with contractors, not taxpayers of our government but taxpayers of our country, the contractors.  We need to see this privatized, in a process, so that we can have an appraisal of a

Let me note that the bipartisan package that was passed by the Senate was balanced in the face of opposition from a Democratic President and Republicans in the House. The package that the Senate passed allowed for the judicial review of compliance investigations of the compliance program in regulatory agencies, providing accountability. It provides much needed certainty to the agency's ability to resolve such complaints without the need for additional litigation and the exposure of private

Mr. President, next month, representatives of the 173 members of the NPT will gather in New York City for their annual convention of the organization that the United States will not sign unless it is fully withdrawn from the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The fact that the United States is still not a signatory of the convention does not in any way indicate that we are a country that is not committed to the Convention. However, the fact that the United States remains a signatory does put our economic relationship with the signatory at risk as it does an important commitment of the United States to the United Nations Convention Against the Crime of Genocide which will be in place for the next 15 years.  I support the effort of the United States to work to establish its own implementation of the convention but believe that a comprehensive commitment

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauer, who died of injuries suffered while responding to a shooting at a Chicago-area community college in December of this year. Paul was only 30 years of age and he was just 23 years of age at the time of his death. He and his partner were standing guard outside the local community college when the shooting took place and they were immediately rushed to the hospital where he was later found by a coworker who was at the scene and in line with the nearest fire truck. However, while Paul was in the hospital he had a surgery that was also carried out by a local colleague and that saved his life in the near future.  Paul was also the only Chicago police officer who was given the Chicago Police Building 2 and 3, and both of these buildings were

If we are not going to bring in more money to the Treasury to pay for new spending programs and it comes out of the defense budget and defense and many other accounts of the Pentagon, then we should be going after every other source in the Department of Defense in order to make sure that we have an appropriate level of pay for our military personnel so that they can meet their responsibilities and our needs in a time of need. It has been discussed that by eliminating the commission in the Armed Services Committee the Chairman of the Committee of the whole that has jurisdiction over defense, I do not think that we have been able to get the kind of measure we need, especially at a time when we are experiencing economic difficulties, when the enemy is tightening its hold on a great part

Mr. President, this spring, the new community health center in Burlington, IA, officially opened for business. The Burlington Health Center is a coalition of healthcare providers who believe that long-term care, especially long-term services, is an important part of a person's quality of life and that being cared for in a hospice community can improve not only the patient's quality of life but also, in some cases, the quality of life for others who will be treated there as well.  Community health centers have traditionally played an important role in rural communities. Nearly 80 percent of the State of Iowa's residents live in areas with fewer than 5,000 people. As evidenced by the statewide rankings for quality of care, Iowa community health centers rank well above the national average in terms of the quality of care they provide.

What is really strange is that the Democratic leadership in this body does not seem to understand what we are talking about here or how it is fundamentally different from what we would be allowed to do if we go to that by way of a constitutional amendment. We would be permitted to do that if we would allow the discussion and the voting that is the way we should go. We have been allowed this for many years now.

In the country today, more than 30 percent of the Nation's veterans are served by CTS-S programs, a program that I was able to chair in the House of Representatives before Congress passed the Vets First Act. Without a dedicated funding source for CTS-S, providers will be unable to carry out the vital health care needs for our veterans. CTS

It is a position which I think should be accorded just consideration on the floor of the Senate and accorded a wide range of other opportunities to be afforded in terms of amendment or other debate to improve that program of protection which is provided by the United States Constitution and which is of some value to our country and the rest of the world.

Mr. Speaker, if we want the recovery package to be successful, we must invest in a number of critical investment priorities. While most of the stimulus package does not provide tax cuts to middle-class families and to the deficit as a whole, we should not be slowing the economic growth of the middle class or making it harder for working-class Americans to get a job. Economic growth should not be done with more tax cuts than is necessary. As the President said recently on the campaign trail, ``The bottom line is that I support giving Americans a tax break of $500 a year for the first time.'' I agree with that statement. But if we are going to tax a $1 out of every $3 in future economic growth we must also give an economic stimulus package which will give some tax cuts for middle class Americans. One idea

There are real consequences for doing nothing. I believe the President should be the first to come to Congress to have this tax increase stopped now.

It was a political statement by the Democrats that he was not really for a balanced budget and that he opposed raising the minimum wage.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment to the Improving America's Schools Act, which would require school districts to require students with disabilities in government-approved activities to participate in government-approved programs or activities such as sports and sports teams in order to receive Federal student aid.  That this amendment is being offered and that I have to come out and speak on it is because our States cannot, and will not, do it alone or alone for our children. Our States must work together in a bipartisan way to make sure that all our citizens receive equal opportunity in education and that America's children are able to compete on the world stage in the 21st century. If we want our children to have a future and the American dream, then we must have a future for our children and for our children's children and our children's

But there are so many amendments that have been offered, we have not even seen the first one yet that have been offered. So there are many things that are going to have to be done. I understand that, and it will be worked out in that effort and certainly we are committed to working with our colleagues on the other side to find some way to get this bill over the finish line in a reasonable amount of time. There are many amendments that have been listed by other Senators, which we are very sensitive to at this time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Secretary of Education branded the 2.7 million teacher-strong National Education Association as ``unserious'' because of its demands that all American schools adopt the Common Core State Standards. Secretary Duncan repeatedly reminded the supporters of the proposed Common Core that ``common core is not about teaching on a separate subject but rather about taking what we know and moving it into an environment where we want it to be used in that classroom.'' The President last year, on the campaign trail, said that ``the ability to get results from education is more important than just a question of who got the best education.'' But to the teachers in the public school system, whose lives depend on doing their job as hard as possible, that statement was a lot of words and it does not do justice to the difficult demands they face. That the Secretary of Education could not

Mr. President, 14 years ago, Congress made a grave mistake. In the dead of night, Congress passed the so-called No Child Left Behind Act, which put the last claim of success for education in America on the back of middle-income and working-class parents and students for the next 14 years. At the time, most Americans were angry with the direction we were taking our country. In fact, many pointed to the massive reductions in Federal funds and the soaring prices at the local school supply stores as evidence that the children of this country were not being treated fairly in Federal education policy.  We all remember the tumult in our schools and colleges just prior to that disastrous act. Many of our young people's lives were being destroyed. It was nearly 10 years after the act was signed that I came to the floor of the Senate to say

My comments have been made in support of it because the process has already been a step in the right direction with the vast majority of the complaints that were filed regarding the ethics complaint process before it was brought to this floor by Members on both sides of the aisle. But we have to be clear about this fact. I understand that House Members and former Members who have been aware of what has happened can hold bad actors accountable for violating their ethics rules. Unfortunately, if that is the case, we also have to be clear that we are not creating an oversight of this Committee of Representatives because the rules have not been established to be so clear about violations of ethical rules.

We are told that the President wants the House to make a mistake and pass the conference report on that floor, and that is why it has gone forward, to that House.  When you talk to the budget, and it will not be as difficult to explain it to a Governor and an elected official as it may be to Senator Glenn and me, is that not the intent of the United States Government to allow us to see the conference report?

Mr. Bernanke has raised similar concerns with this bill when we have been considering bills on national security and other matters since January and the most recent version of this bill has been extremely limited in scope and quality that we have seen, especially with respect to security and national interest policies. This is a critical bill, in that it is a serious attempt to restore fiscal stability to our economy and to reduce the deficit.

Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army SSG William J. Wallin who was killed by an improvised explosive device in Ar Irbid province, Iraq on November 28, 2006. His extraordinary selfless service to our country resulted in his death in the line of duty after returning from deployment.  Lieutenant Wallin enlisted in the Army at the age of 17 and was assigned to a unit assigned to the 101st Airborne Division in Bethesda, Maryland. Lieutenant Wallin was honorably discharged from the Army Reserve after 3 years of active duty in 1988 and was honorably discharged from the Army National Guard in 2003. Lieutenant Wallin's heroic service to his country has earned the respect and admiration of his fellow soldiers and our troops around the world.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3153 and H.R. 2988, the Rural Housing and Assistance Construction Improvements Act of 2006. These bills provide rural communities all of the important services that are critical for maintaining affordable housing in rural areas.  Each community faces unique housing challenges as each of these bills gives local agencies the resources to focus on the housing needs of the most vulnerable communities and not just those who are making a million dollar per year or more income. These two bills together provide for approximately $3.5 billion in direct funding to the State and local housing agencies for construction of new affordable housing units throughout the country. This is the most requested funding increase in this subcommittee's history and would be even more so if it were allocated to the transportation needs of our communities as well.  Much has already been said about the tremendous need

So now that we are here today to do something about him, we are going to have to focus on the President's foreign policy, because it is unwise to leave his policies alone while he is there. President Trump has already ignored Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran. He has even threatened Russia, whose leadership supports Assad. His policies have continued to isolate, isolate, isolate Russia. And we all know that relations between Saudi Arabia and Russia have been strained by both authoritarian despots and peaceful citizens, like the people of Ukraine and so many other places.

The status quo of Iraqi reconstruction is in full swing. Some groups are attempting to fund them or continue existing projects under their control. Others are beginning to band together and launch terrorist attacks against the Iraqi people and Iraqi security forces. We should be prepared to help each of these groups combat the extremists operating in Iraq by providing a key commitment of assistance and resources on top of our $1.7 billion commitment for reconstruction

Mass shootings have become routine for our Nation in this town of ours. Every week, over two dozen were perpetrated.  This year, at least 38 were claimed and 14 others were reported to police. The message that we've heard from the public and from law enforcement officials is that we have to take additional steps to stop these tragedies before they occur. Nowhere is that more important than in our gun laws and the status of our second amendment rights.  There is bipartisan agreement that an assault weapons ban would make a big difference in preventing future mass shootings. According to the New York Daily News, an average of about 10 mass shootings occur each year, about one every 3 days.

That is their reason for opposing the reconciliation bill today. They say the rule makes it harder for them to prevent the kind of tax increases and massive cuts the Republicans proposed last year, and they should know what it does to the middle class and to seniors in this country. They believe the extreme and imprudent budget plan unveiled by the majority will do more to destroy Social Security and Medicare and provide no guarantee of health care to Americans than any current proposal of the Republicans. They say they have offered no alternative to this bill

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. First of all, let us do what is necessary in this bill to provide us adequate funding to make sure that our Members have the financial resources they need to make the tough decisions that will be necessary to get us to where we want to go in terms of a long-term reconstruction of Iraq and we will be able to do that through tax dollars which we are actually going to be sending to Iraq. We do not have to do anything else to do it.  Mr. Chairman, this bill has an additional 7 months to go because this additional money is going to be under the key program which is about $2 billion for Iraq. I would just say that this is not something that is a Republican idea or Democrat idea that we should be doing any longer in our country's history that

Madam President, the war in Iraq is the greatest challenge facing our country. Unfortunately, the administration is unwilling to face this challenge head-on and devote the resources necessary to make the strategy work. Congress has repeatedly given the administration the tools it needs to make Iraq work. More recently, we have passed the bipartisan Iraq Accountability and Iraq Security Act. This act will bring Iraqis to the table and put an end to any looting and destruction in Iraq.  President Bush is rightly vowing his administration will come to this floor and vote on a supplemental supplemental next month to deal with this emergency, but, unfortunately, the administration is now preying on Members and our patience with a point of order before the Budget Committee for the omnibus appropriations bill.  In the past several months, the administration has refused to acknowledge the reality that there is still work

I have been involved in this debate since it began and am opposed to the bill that Senator Snowe and I have proposed to bring up in this Senate.  I have said that the bill before us will have adverse effects on the quality of care for Indians. We have had some discussions about how that would be addressed as we examine the bill in conference. But the legislation that we propose to have introduced in this Senate this week would undermine the quality of care that is provided to Indian patients in this country.  The bill would eliminate the block grant programs that provide guaranteed care to Indians in rural areas of this country. Indian health care has taken care of people in States such as

Mr. Speaker, my friend from New York claims this is not political. Forty-five minutes ago he said Republican funds would go to abortion. For two-thirds of those abortion dollars, the President has promised not to participate, the Speaker says we should spend the money on the women's health and the children's health. For the President, not a penny of his money will go for abortion. But we are told this Republican Senate has endorsed his bill to provide a young woman the right to make the decision whether to have an abortion by the State health department, the State secretary, the State physician, or the local hospital.  It is unconscionable, Mr. Speaker, that the Republicans' campaign to defund Planned Parenthood by proposing to force taxpayers' dollars to pay for abortion services is political.

Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the next several years. The goals of updating our policy have changed from those set out by Congress more than 20 years ago. I believe that Congress should change the policy to reflect the changing U.S. agricultural and food market realities and our new responsibilities as a country.  A review of the current policy during the 1990's has pointed to several issues which need to be addressed in order to improve the effectiveness of the U.S. program in providing support to local communities and other government entities that provide local support for farmers in supplying that Nation's agricultural producers. The following items should be considered as part of a proposed reform of the Federal program to improve the effectiveness and success of the Federal program in this area:

Last week, the House Agriculture Committee and the Federal Aviation Administration brought up legislation that would reauthorize the Office of Policy Research and make some important changes to the legislation.
