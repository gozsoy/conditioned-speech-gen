Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP remains below 5 percent over a 7-year period as the Clinton plan now provides in its budget request to Congress. The Bill Clinton plan has failed to provide for the kind of fiscal stability that the Committee on Rules chairman has called for and that I have supported for many years in the past as a Republican Member of this Congress and as the State Director of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  This provision is not supported by the Chamber of Commerce, and I fear that it may be voted down in the Committee on Rules by the Democrats on the Committee on Education and Labor.  It is not the purpose of this amendment to support or oppose a particular Member of Congress. This is simply a matter of fairness to Members of Congress as they attempt to follow the Congressional Budget Act

Madam President, the shootings last week at Virginia Tech touched every American, indeed people around the world, and should have been a wake-up call to the United States of America to be vigilant and on the alert and concerned for the American people. But no Americans should be surprised that the community and the young people of Virginia Tech would learn and learn and learn about their hero's history in the shooter's arsenal, not, as was predicted, the flashbulbs that shot him dead.  That rifle did not in fact fire, but it did shoot a loaded magazine filled with chambered hollow-point bullets, some 40 bullets.

I am offering this amendment as part of the Budget Control Act conference report because the policies and funding at NIH and the underlying bill are designed to accelerate the elimination of unnecessary medical expenditures. Over the past 6 years, the NIH and the underlying bill have gone through a series of major appropriations cuts that have greatly reduced funding for basic research. The conference report before us continues those cuts to over $300 million below FY14 level.

What the Democratic bill will mean is that all but the senior age of the Nation will see their drug costs increase by over $3,000 a year by the year the loss occurs, a $9,000 increase, that is, the difference between the cost of a given brand of medicine and the amount they would pay out-of-pocket.

I would like to thank my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee, Ranking Member Smith and his good friend from the Financial Services Committee, Ranking Member Kildee for their work that led to this very important result and for their leadership on this issue that we all have the good fortune to be able to support here today as well that they so much so want this very important military so that we might have that well defended that will be available for our Armed Forces and those that need that so that they might not have that much that they are not so concerned that what they do is not what fact on the ground is important.  We have waited for 6 years to put that in place. It is well known to everyone as a current reality that more training for our military needs is an important

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also want to add my voice to her remarks as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and all of those that we are so very proud to support.  Just a few days ago a resolution was passed that said that this is a failure of the United States Congress to properly prepare for homeland security. It doesn't mean that we don't want to secure our ports or ports of entry; but we need to be prepared for any humanitarian emergency to be able to quickly get to our communities.

A $300-a-month increase in your fuel bill. Now, the way to remember all of this, it goes back to what they have been talking about for the last time over the last several years and that is tax cuts that affect one side of this bill when you do a certain set of things in that specific bill for one side of that bill and that is why so many of us have just kind of put the cart before the horse again because we turn the bill over to the Appropriations Committee and say, okay, maybe it's not necessarily so hard to cut back.  Here is one group that they come up and talk about who are these folks, poor Americans.

They could file cloture on the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. That is why Senator McCain has asked that this time be very unusual in that we do not have any other idea in this body, and we have a couple of very unusual ideas that we think we can come together on and make this work so that this thing does not get to the kind of tremendous amount of people that it could have if this thing is not given more time because we think this thing really ought not be interesting.

This is a test of our will and determination to provide for a more affordable, more secure health care system for the American people, but it is not a test of Eisenhower's will nor was it a test of Reagan's determination to provide our troops with the health care that they need and deserve. We are moving into a situation in which an economy is beginning to crumble. The medical care will not be available to the millions of people who will come from a health care system that is already getting out of hand.

Mr. President, there have been some other things he has said that are important and important because it is so important that the South and North have a full understanding of the issues that are at the core of this problem that we have in the United States as well as the major European countries who are trying to find a way to resolve this very difficult question. We have just received the final draft of a resolution by the Foreign Relations Committee that will be a recommendation of this body.  I am concerned about what the Foreign Relations Committee has done, because it is my understanding, as I have indicated, that Senator Byrd and I have been fighting the last few days to

I thank the gentleman. The fact remains over 135 amendments were submitted on time to the Rules Committee for consideration of this bill and it did not take more than a week for the chairman to get an agreement that the bill should be on the floor and that we would put it up for the full week of Wednesday and Thursday for our defense appropriations process to be effective. So we have a very effective process on this bill which has taken some time to bring to the floor but was done in a most efficient way and in a time-efficient and professional way that services the needs of the American people.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The Senator has presented what seems to be a very realistic package. I am certainly not suggesting that we do not take care of the children at the Federal health care agencies and that these funds be taken out of programs that serve them or that they be transferred to other Government agencies with their own needs to respond appropriately to that future benefit.  I also would say that the Senator from Kentucky mentioned the full retirement age of the Federal employees now because it seems to me that was not adequately addressed by favorably acted legislation, so I have a feeling that in an effort to restore order and sanity here, the Senator from Kentucky will address this in an appropriations bill.

They will be short, but I will save them for my final remarks and just say that I do not think it was in the nature of the amendment to take it as an up-or-down vote on the basis of our acting on it before we actually got into it.  Let me also say that Senator Biden was very gracious in the way in which he took care of Senator McCain. I appreciate it very much when the Senator of Virginia makes a Thanksgiving meal and it is a kind meal.  Senator Reid, I know, as well, was very gracious.

Madam President, I know there are others waiting to speak. I don't want to delay anybody who has a question so I am prepared to speak as if I have 15 minutes on the vote we are about to have and that they delay after that vote. We are not here until they have the vote so we need to get that set aside for about 10 minutes to give the remaining questions that may come over from those who are concerned. So I hope we can go on as if we have 15 minutes. After that it will be possible to go to the vote on the pending proceedings on the Durbin amendment and on the vehicle-free-vehicle bill. So we can go back to the vehicles until there is some time to vote.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, I rise today out of deep concern about the budget that was passed yesterday in the House of Representatives and the budget that is coming before the Senate today. I have come to the floor to talk about the budget that the administration and the House of Representatives passed yesterday in the House of Representatives and the budget that the Senate will likely consider later this month that would increase the Federal deficit by almost $1 trillion over the next decade by rising taxes and additional spending.  I want to highlight a couple of things that I think need to be stressed when we talk about the budget that we passed yesterday in the House of Representatives and the budget that the Senate will likely consider later this month. One is that the future for our children is really the future of this country, and that is the problem that we have for our children and that

Madam Chair, first, I would like to thank Congressmen Brown and Crist for an excellent bill to help protect America's public lands and not only those who serve on them but to assist with a recovery of some of the record timber sales which have been taking place at times over the last decade that have been hard-hitting to the rate of growth of the timber industry of this country, but not least the State of Nevada as far as estimates and, of course, the footprint as far as restoring those lands in an environmentally sound way. I know the gentleman from Nevada has been critical of the way in which we have worked to strengthen conservation measures and restore the wetlands of the area of concern in Nevada. The bill before us provides a way to go forward on that and for the State of Nevada to take a stand against this destructive logging practice.

Mr. Speaker, watching Bill and Hillary explain their finances reminds me of an old Steve Martin song: ``All That You Can Take'' or ``Back to the Future Part II.'' Today's tax debate is less about what we should or should not pay as a country and more about whether Congress needs to cut spending more than it has been cut this year to restore finances.  In 2006, Congress inherited a budget deficit of $514 billion. This year, the deficit is $2.5 trillion. House Republicans have now proposed to bring the deficit down to $450 billion in 2009.  Even though Republicans cut spending by approximately $12 billion, that is only 1-year cut and will have a significant and detrimental impact on the Nation's economy. I have a chart here from my constituents at Charlton.net, which I think

Mr. President, anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. Constitution knows that no President can spend a dime of Federal tax money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by Congress--both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.  And no President can spend a dime of Federal tax money that has not been either the product of direct appropriation or the product of a legislative appropriation Act, as amended.  So we have here the familiar story of the congressional appropriation of a bill that is both a direct appropriations act for a specific appropriation account and, therefore, has as its authorizing committee the full membership of the House and Senate of the United States. In other words, it is an authorization conference committee, where all House and Senate bills conference from one conference committee to another, and in some cases even from the executive branch to the

Instead of pursuing that action which might justify that label, the people of the United States of America are looking at the fact that someone had the foresight of putting the greatest threats to our security on the Web site to which they are giving a half-billion dollars, and instead of embracing that action,

Madam Speaker, House Democrats' fiscally irresponsible budget will impose on American workers and businesses a tax hike of over $300 billion over the next decade and raise taxes on American consumers by $350 billion. This bill will directly tax the American people for new business investment in education and environmental protection and prevent Congress from taking steps to control runaway spending. It will raise taxes on millions of families and businesses and will cause them to have to choose between paying the taxes they pay or having a tax speaker tell them they can't deduct the fees they pay. It will send back a $1,000 tax credit to those who cannot afford it or will take a $2,000 tax credit from small business owners.  I am one of them.

Madam President, all of us were home in August. It was a pretty good thing when we went back to our districts and we met people like the guys we see on the DoSomething campaign because we know how hard it is for people to get the kind of thing they want.  Now we get the bill we have to debate today and debate for many weeks to come and those are the kinds of things we need to care about.  I think it is somewhat outrageous and not helpful to debate in a newspaper article, but I did make one point when we are debating it that has probably been around for quite a while. It was on the list of concerns I heard so much from the folks who were concerned about corporate America when this bill came up last fall. They kept saying: Don't you dare add penny-wise and pound

Mr. Speaker, one of the great arguments that I have heard in this debate about deficit reduction is the need to reform and reform this welfare system as much as possible so that it does not work anymore, because in its current form, the welfare system is currently woefully underfunded and largely ineffective.  The House recently passed two programs that address this problem and I would like to focus on one of those programs now before us where college tuition assistance would be paid for by eliminating this tax that increases wages. It would be paid for in two ways, and that is to make sure that the benefit of a college education is distributed fairly and that college graduates who can only find a good job that pays an average of $15,000 a year will be able to bring that income to the average working family.

It was an effort to bring that agreement and the President and the American people forward because that has been one of the outstanding accomplishments of the Clinton administration.  And, if we look at the President's budget request, it is rather flat. It does not make it. It is even less than the President's budget for this year, and more like the administration proposal for the year 2002.

Mr. Chairman, I cannot even believe this debate. Is the border a national security checkpoint or a military base?   Mr. Chairman, in light of the importance of this issue and the need to restore and protect America's border security, I rise in support of this amendment. But I must say this amendment is a turkey mideast policy that Republicans and Democrats have been working on for years and we think they are in for a big win here. Let me first of all state the House Republican position. Indiana has always, this in 1965, historically supported our country by a large majority of all of its voters when we passed a House position, a very strong position, on asylum.  Under Republican leadership, since 1980, Indiana has taken a different view, a different approach to asylum. Rather than go along with the Vietnamese and the Pakistan

We've had hearings to show where we're going to increase spending in every single area except Social Security, except those that the people get in their retirement and their children's retirement.

Madam President, my amendment limits the encouragement of the development of natural gas resources beneath the Outer Continental Shelf and calls for the President to issue specific direction and regulations to the Secretary of the Interior to encourage the development of underground natural gas resources beneath this area.  In accordance with the 1994 gas leases issued by the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary, under certain circumstances, may authorize oil and gas leasing on natural gas resources that lie beneath the Outer Continental Shelf.  Madam President, in 1994, by a narrow, 28-vote margin, the House and Senate considered the use of ``all lands under public control'' for leasing. This language, however, offered no direction or permit for Federal exploration for natural gas or oil resources beneath the Outer Continental Shelf. Instead, it simply directed the Secretary of the Interior to develop

We have changed the way our intelligence agencies analyze threat information and deter attacks. And Congress has passed major anti-terrorism legislation, the USA PATRIOT Act, and passed legislation improving oversight of agencies. We have strengthened our counterterrorism capabilities. We have required substantial improvements in how intelligence is collected and used.  President Obama and the Democratic leadership have consistently fought to protect our nation from further terrorist attacks.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires the Department of Transportation to make safety and traffic safety improvements for highway traffic accidents and to implement rulemaking to improve these safety systems. It provides the necessary funds for safety of highway traffic accidents. The authorization provided for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration provides funds for the safety programs which are required to protect the public. For these programs, there is no budgetary funding.  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation requested the Transportation appropriations conference report to provide approximately $30 million for safety and traffic safety programs for the 1994-95 fiscal year and $25 million for 1998-99. This represents approximately 5 percent of the total budget for the safety and traffic safety programs for the current

Mr. Chairman, let me simply explain that the Lowey motion to recommit will be with the same funding for the week after the first week that the second year is in full funding, provided that the second year is 50 percent less than the minimum needed to sustain program additional funding in the base bill that we have before us today.  So, on a budget basis, we will maintain roughly what is in the committee. For purposes of adjourning, we will have the opportunity to spend money. That is a matter that the majority has made a high priority.

Mr. Speaker, this House continues to conduct an essential debate over our Nation's policy in Iraq and the war on terror. It's a debate that deserves to be well and truly debated in the last several weeks. But let us be clear about what our troops are fighting against Saddam Hussein. That is the terrorists whom Saddam Hussein has sent to kill us in Iraq and now he is killing Iraqi people with this action and the despicable manner in which he did it. The latest news is that this week's New York Times has claimed that the 10,000 Americans killed in the first 15 days of the assault on Iraq are more than double the number killed by the first six months of the Bush administration.  To be perfectly honest, Mr. Speaker, the last 4 months has brought us the most horrific images of our soldiers--with rocket launchers,

I wonder, does the Senator think any parents of these kids earning $10,000 to $26,000 a year would not think it was ``gross abuse'' to cut $2 billion out of Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for the very rich who pay taxes and get money from Medicare and Medicaid programs? The Senator has a bill which funds Medicaid for every child in this country who needs Medicaid care or underfunded Medicaid. How about these welfare payments to these parents? You take the money from Medicaid, the block grant, it goes to poor people. We reduce that in the bill that we are considering. If the President wants to help poor families, give the money to them, it is not gross abuse to cut $2 billion out of the Medicaid program to pay for tax cuts for the very rich. We should say enough is enough, give these children

Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear about the budget for the select panel. The resolution requested by the minority will not reduce the spending to the level requested in the agreement by the House by a single penny for the Government of the United States of America solely because of its allocation for programs funded by the majority to the minority by a portion of the continuing resolution this year. It will increase spending to $1 billion below existing levels for the new and additional programs that will come to the committee as a result of the consideration of the substitute offered by the majority today for the request to receive the majority's cuts.  The Senate has passed a budget which will reduce the overall government spending rate to near freeze this year, or in the case of the appropriations bills will raise it to zero.

He talked about the fact that the debate on the resolution is really over where we can find the substance in the stimulus package that is enacted, but it's not over the ideas that we're all talking about today.  The fact is that we're talking about a $8.5 trillion package, $8.5 trillion in spending. We've already told you that that is not going to work.

Today this House will vote to pass the true reform that the American people are demanding in this Nation questionnaires and voice letters to U.S. Senators.  The American people want their Federal Government to control their own lives.  Since the Watergate crisis, the American people have been calling for change.

Last year at a time when the American people came together to cut our deficit by 25 percent, in a country in which the deficit was over 10 percent, out of control, had something called a surplus, we kept adding $300 billion to the deficit each year.

This is a very important issue that I believe the Senate ought to take up this week. I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to support the underlying legislation the Senator from West Virginia has put in place to commemorate anniversary of the sinking of the American merchant fleet by the Nazis. Senator Byrd and I introduced the resolution that came to be known as the Billion Dollars Billion Dollars trillion For the Victims of the Holocaust, Memorial Act on May 16, 1995, which would authorize $125 million for each of the next 10 years, the next five years, and 1996,

The Senator is quite right, with this one exception: We have provided ourselves with universal access to military hospitals and we have encouraged the American public to use those institutions as the only Federal Government-paid outpatient hospital for the American people. That is what Senator Reid and I will continue to do. But it is important to note also that as we review our spending in fiscal year 1994, we are not going to do any more for the DOD on research to help that airplane that crashed with all the people killed on board. The tragedy, I believe, in the Senator's estimation, would be the fact that we would give $5 billion more for defense items and say ``Okay, here is a surplus--whatever you can spare for the Defense Department.'' If we did that, I believe the Senator would not hesitate to say ``Oh, there

The same American people I spoke to a year ago were eager to know what had been accomplished on the issue of America's war in Iraq, and they want to know what was accomplished to bring our troops home from Iraq.  The financial transactions, the oil revenues and other tax dollars that are being used to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan don't come from the people of America.

Mr. Speaker, $5 trillion of debt, $200 billion deficits, $187,000 in interest debt for a budget deficit of over $1 trillion. This American Congress can solve this problem with another $500 billion, so a balanced budget for this country.  First, for America to have a balanced budget, we must pass a balanced budget amendment that we have never before voted on; that takes the slush fund away from the Social Security and from the Medicare programs, this tiny slush fund that has grown so much that it is taking too much of our limited dollars and, therefore, it would be a system that people would like to have in place for a long time, not only through our children, but through our grandchildren.  Let me be clear, the right way to balance the budget and save this country's future is to pass a balanced budget

I urge my colleagues to support this bill to stop the rise in American drug prices that may result from bad health decisions made by drug companies for years and prevent health care costs for American families from going up for years to come.

As far as the chairman of the committee is concerned, the budget resolution was sent over to the House of Representatives just a few minutes ago and the House side has been moving ahead with their program of taxes and cuts that will affect the health care of millions of people.  The reason we came to the floor this morning, Mr. President, was for the purpose of speaking to this budget resolution, and I had to be in New York this morning because the Senator from South Carolina had an amendment to the Republican welfare reform plan that was defeated by the House of Representatives last night.

Two of those provisions are related to research in human stem cells and would strengthen Congress and the President's authority to approve embryonic stem cell research and the President's ability to authorize the Attorney General to weaken Federal research and development controls. Those two provisions would be the amendments of the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton] and the other representatives of New Jersey [Mr. Saxton]. The first one requires a report to the President by December 31, 2005. We are already seeing how the Bush administration deals with federal grants and permits.

There is a difference of opinion as to what the amount of money that Government spends should be and should not be paid for and should finance programs that it does not believe are worthwhile or worthwhile because they yield revenues to the Government.  The first point the Senator made was that a limitation or a cap has to be raised if we are going to be deficit neutral. The CPI used by the President has been a very unreliable tool. Inflation has been going up, up and up.

Mr. Chairman, at the outset, I want to praise the gentleman from New York [Mr. Walsh] for his very careful analysis of this bill and what it means to some of the most needy in our society, especially the elderly and the poor.

Mr. Speaker, while many are quick to criticize the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the act which this Congress is about to take up today, the truth is this is a good bill for our country and for working families all across this country who need the time off for work and school so they can take time off so they can take time off to take time off day in and day out.  Mr. Speaker, it is a good bill for business and for millions and millions of American families.  It is a good bill for a growing economy, for millions of Americans who want to work, who want to help their families, who want to be productive workers and not just cheap workers.

Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my colleagues Senator Nickles and Senator Bond in introducing legislation to correct the recent restrictions which have limited small business access to capital and income tax benefits for many of their employees.  This legislation is sponsored by the House Small Business Committee and the Senate Small Business Committee of this Government and would transfer certain tax benefits to employees of Federal agencies and to employees and beneficiaries of pay-as-you-go programs. The legislation provides tax relief for financial institutions and financial research groups, and it helps encourage small businesses to expand their payrolls by allowing exemptions for loans, loans for conservation easements, and loan guarantees for construction and repair of facilities. It authorizes two additional tax breaks which will increase the average capital gains exemption for workers, their spouses and dependent children by $10,000 and allows for

While all the recent hearings on Coast Guard funding, subcommittee chairman for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Mr. Blumenauer, and his subcommittee staff have been exceedingly informative and persuasive, it was almost entirely for the purpose of arguing against this amendment that I came to support the amendment.

Madam Chair, I stand in opposition to the amendment offered by my dear colleague, Mrs. Johnson.  The Johnson amendment would make it easier for the IRS to hold its employees at a salary or bonus below the agency should they be laid off if they stand up against the agency and demand more than what was paid for them by the agency. This kind of negative employee retaliation would prevent the Employee Free Choice Act from removing this possibility for employees who ask for a raise, but who are told that by working too hard and being a colleague to the agency they would be fired.  The Employee Free Choice Act allows employees who have been subjected to negative workplace discrimination or threats of retaliation to exercise free choice to get a raise or not receive a raise. This bill also provides all individuals with an opportunity to appeal the agency's decision to fire or modify employment

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system that as far as the eye could see would do more to reduce poverty than the social services that did it with in it would be able to do it on its own by reform and community control. He also recognized that this new welfare system would eventually have to take it down and turn it over to States as a part of a Federal block grant system of Federal aid. Roosevelt was correct in recognizing that poverty could be achieved within the context of the Community Services Block Grant and also when block grants are allowed to act as the front end for improving the human condition of each and every individual within the population.  The political and economic success of this Nation can be measured in the number of lives saved and with the number of people receiving work assistance. We saw this

What we have done today is we have done that in the sense that there is bipartisan consensus that these proposed cuts, whether we accept them or reject them or filibuster them, should not be debated and that, again, that means a final floor vote.  The President's own budget, as has been indicated by a lot of people over the past few weeks, highlights our country's economic strength. There has been very little discussion about the trillions of dollars

He said we had agriculture interests that would be willing to pay for it without our having to vote on it. That is not the case at all. We have made the commitment to pay for this work through the bill itself which the other side has not brought to the floor yet and that we will do so with the human decency that was demonstrated on the floor of the Senate yesterday and the indication we will show again on the floor of the Senate when we vote in the morning. coli?

This is a bill that we would not want to start debating if this amendment were offered and agreed to on this floor today. We would not be serious about the Federal Government interfering in the private sector and possibly requiring violent retribution on those who would interfere with the life of another man or the life of another woman if they were to interfere with their minutes and if they were to inflict the kind of terrible consequences that have been outlined by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens].  This would cause the States, all 50 States, to have to comply, whether they choose to opt in or opt out, and I think that is a dangerous precedent for us to set.

Furthermore, this amendment would eliminate the requirement that there be specific requirements as to how the report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff should be written.

The situation in Iraq is grave and dangerous, potentially devastating to the economy and international standing of our country and has demonstrated to be a primary cause of our foreign policy failure in the last 16 months. We have got to help the men and women who are in uniform and Andy, I want to thank him for all his leadership and most of his support on this bill. We need to keep working to rebuild this Burgess-Grassley-Barton-Rangel amendment which allows funds for our Nation's critical infrastructure.  I am a co-chair of the Iraq Veterans Memorial Commission, and,

I associate myself with the comments from the ranking member of the Government Affairs Committee. Senator Nunn and I worked together to give the President a budget that is both balanced and responsible and reflects the economic priorities of the country of America as it is now composed by Government. I agree with the chairman of the committee that the President did the most important thing he could do in meeting the crisis that is now present in our Government system when he proposed to issue a budget that was balanced and responsible to the American people and that made the President and the Members of this body look like something other than do-nothing congressional Republicans. I thank him very much for that effort.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the majority leadership for bringing this bill, S. 2, to the floor today. Senate bill 2130, introduced on November 3 by Senator Paul Wellstone of Montana, would provide additional funding for the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to address congressional abuses at the IRS and other tax agencies. My amendment would appropriate $25 million to the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for fiscal year 1997 for oversight and accountability at IRS and other tax agencies. I also commend Senator Kennedy for his efforts to reauthorize and reform the Tax Code, and Speaker Tip O'Neill for his quick action on the Senate bill. I also wish to recognize the efforts of Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island for his help on this legislation.  Like many Americans, I have long been concerned that the IRS wastes its precious tax dollars that are collected

For taxpayers across America, whether they work in urban and suburban America or small businesses or farmers, school districts, counties, schools, hospitals, churches or other non-governmental entities that serve the citizens, the rule is going to make life more expensive.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. From the very beginning of the debate over the PATRIOT Act there were those on the other side of the aisle who cited that the Government should be required to obtain a warrant before searching private property in the United States. They said that there were only a few in this country who could have the intelligence to permit the government to even come in and go in the official residence of the President of the United States. And what they were doing was saying the Government would know that such an executive executive executive chairman of a public university, of a public university is going to be traveling in a private residence, and that even if that is wrong, they will not be allowed to access that room or their home or their office.

Nearly 90 percent of minimum wage workers in the United States already earn more than $10 per hour and will soon see their pay raise to $10.10 if this tax loophole is closed.  Last week, Republicans took the first step to end corporate welfare. We stood up for the middle class. The action that took place last week is another step toward promoting our agenda.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Hall amendment. There isn't a more vulnerable group in our country than the poor because they are the hardest hit by the rising cost of living. While every family has to make difficult choices in food, housing, and health care to get by and provide their families with the funds they need to be healthy and contribute to their communities, many poor families do not have the resources to have this affected by a doubling of the poverty line from $7.25 a day to $10.50 a day. The issue here is how much work these two decisions should be made on the part of the Federal Government.  We all are concerned about the deficit and the issues facing the Federal Government, but I believe in reforming our welfare system and putting people back to work. There is no reason to increase the

So for the record I will be very clear that there is no way that we are going to allow a vehicle from the Finance Committee or the Senate to put a land grant university, to cut $1 billion of funding from this bill and then come to the floor and, without debate, vote on a continuing resolution.  If we are going to stay here and have a discussion, I hope the focus would be on the fact that the budget resolution and the regular appropriations bills would go first.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the extension of a very important program which is currently in our State's Dairy Production Account--the Conservation Support Grant Program.  The Agricultural Market Support Corporation [AMSC] provides much-needed support to producers and processors for the production and storage of milk in States that need assistance.  The AMSC funds come from the Dairy Promotion Tax Credits [DPTC] which are derived from milk processors' production credits. These credits have become a critical source of the funds needed to ensure that low-income farmers maintain control over their land and money instead of subjecting it to speculation.  Without the U.S. dairy production subsidy program, dairy producers would have to sacrifice the rights to just 1 percent of their land for a 5-year period--in some cases up to

These programs ensure that children in the poorest communities of America get to eat some of their school food every day and many workers on Federal contractors have to participate in the provision of the school lunch provisions of this amendment. In addition, the amendment would destroy the work force nutrition program for school districts as well as would cut program funding for school nutrition, which is another crucial job training program for the children of America.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Secretary of Education branded the 2.7 million teacher-strong National Education Association as ``extreme'' and ``unfairly biased'' and vowed to change its membership by the end of the year and use ``hard work and determination'' in addressing these criticisms. Secretary DeVos later said that the National Education Association was ``anybody but a ``fair-minded organization.'' That comment was astounding, considering the organization is funded largely by the Republican National Committee, funded by the Koch brothers, and funded by the National Education Association itself.  Despite the criticism Secretary DeVos received last year, nea adam has focused on the bottom line and less on politics. This, of course, means NEA is going to become more brazen and anti-choice than ever.

This decision does not make sense and should be rejected by the President, and I strongly support his veto.  Unfortunately, despite the overwhelming support for this veto message, the leadership has decided not to bring up this issue at a conference of the other body. It may be a good idea to allow this problem to go before the Senate on the budget resolution. However, it is also my hope that we will have additional opportunities to strengthen the inflationary control measures by other means.

The amendment is necessary to reform the President's ``one size fits all'' rule under the 1996 Federal budget resolution. The program to which the amendment is designed was authorized under the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1978 but never fully implemented because the Clinton administration would force the funds to be deposited in a three-track account rather than in the more diversified ``deemed'' account.

Mr. Speaker, President Trump is headed to Saudi Arabia today, which is an authoritarian, theocratic regime of Saudi Arabia, and today is President Obama trying to assert this administration's authority to extend the Government of Saudi Arabia as an ally of the United States. The Foreign Relations Committee has spoken on this, and I hope in due course that we will stand together and have that voice silenced on this rule and this rule vote.  President Trump has authoritarian overlord in Saudi Arabia. We have said this several times before, and the facts are there that President Trump's overthrow in Saudi Arabia last month of the previous king did the following. It destabilized Saudi Arabia's military. It destabilized its domestic economy and caused that economy to spin out of control.  Two weeks ago I saw Saudi Arabia sell 20 percent of its oil to Iran.

The farm bill, C-11, is the product of a discussion between the farm and conservation wing of Congress that was initiated in 1993 and developed by the committee of jurisdiction.  Currently, regulations exist which inhibit the growth and development of our nation's diverse and critically important agricultural sector. This is especially true in areas such as specialty crops, environmental regulation, provisions related to weight regulation, and the farm family

Reclaiming my time, I agree with the gentleman. Whatever you call this bill, on this side of the aisle there are Republicans who want to give children a health care that they can count on and not to give them government-run hospitals and be told what to do.  My only point is I hope that Democrats on this side of the aisle can take a look at this, because I think there are certain things that are possible. I think we ought to consider all of these things. We ought to reclaim the floor and make that debate real.  But for my part, I would rather have children die than go down that road. I would rather see children in pain.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues back to the Senate. I hope all of us in the Senate are in a good mood and a cheer as we all try to understand and put into context what we are seeing as we are entering the Fourth of July and we are trying to get our constituents back to work. We have to go to work because the American people have to be up and about and making a difference in this country and States. They want to be able to send their children to school and they want to see their children working hard and saving for their future.  While my colleagues in the Senate may want to know that the President is still trying to get the unemployment rate down to 6.5 percent--let's be honest about that--that means that people have not counted the millions of Americans who have gone out of work

Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued its ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the court decision concerning the Rule of Law and a defense that Boeing said was not a defense to the protest because the Government would have been required to pay if the Office of Defense had already paid its attorneys for all the work that the agency did to prepare for and defend the court decision and to prevent costs from shifting to other employees who could not afford it because they would have jobs on the line.  This is an important finding, and I am very pleased that the President is leading on this matter in our conversation today, and in the Congress, with Senator Warner.  This is an important ruling. It is similar to the ruling that was issued recently on the Republican side, in which the DOD Inspector General declared that by this point in time, the Inspector
