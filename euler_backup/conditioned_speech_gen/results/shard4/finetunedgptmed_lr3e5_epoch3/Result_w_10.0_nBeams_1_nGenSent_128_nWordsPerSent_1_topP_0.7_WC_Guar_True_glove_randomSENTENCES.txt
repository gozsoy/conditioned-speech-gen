Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare Program Performance Improvement Act of 2003.

In order to obtain payments from the MPP, the health care professionals must meet certain performance goals and certify their ability to meet these goals.

The Committee on Appropriations should immediately follow suit. The House and Senate have both done the right thing.  Our veterans deserve the most generous and best care in the world.

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment gentleman from South Carolina has proposed. I opposed the committee-reported bill because it did not include the Illinois border crossing fee, and I believe that this is a real problem that we need to address.  The Illinois border crossing fee has been a problem for the State of Illinois for a number of years. In 1994, a House Committee on Appropriations subcommittee voted to terminate the current $3.75 per vehicle fee on the southwest border. I voted for this amendment because I believe it is a sensible approach to a real problem that exists in

Mr. President, President Bush has the time but it is not really the time that we should be taking the matter up. We ought to be talking about the situation in Iraq, but the administration seems determined to be totally detached from reality.  In a speech this morning, President Bush made a statement that he says he wants to ``examine the issue of U.S. troop strength and what is going on in Iraq.''  The President's statement was delivered before he even had a chance to respond to questions about the nature of the surge. So the administration has no idea what the American people are saying to them.  Let's look at what

Mr. President, I will vote for this bill because it is a good program and it provides education for children in America. But I also believe that we must address some of the many deficiencies in this bill. I am concerned about many of the provisions of the bill that have been negotiated between the House and Senate.  First, this bill provides a special education education program for children who have been disadvantaged because of a disability, but in many cases cannot get an adequate education because of their disability. This special education program is also supposed to be flexible, allowing parents to transfer their children to another public school if they do not need the assistance. Unfortunately, the

But there is no urgency here in the way of the country and the economy of the island. It is the same urgency that exists with respect to an agreement on Haiti. It is the same urgency that exists with respect to an agreement on the Middle East peace process. There is no urgency with respect to Haiti.  The key to all of these agreements is a political settlement. I hope the administration will work with us on that.

Mr. President, last week State officials in New Mexico and across the country came to a much different conclusion than the government of New Mexico had had in years.  For years, the New Mexico Supreme Court had been ordered by a Federal judge to begin a legal battle over the definition of marriage in New Mexico.  This legal battle, the most significant battle the State of New Mexico has seen in years, is taking place because of an amendment passed by Congress last year to the U.S. Constitution.  This amendment was the result of a heated debate among some in Congress and among the State legislatures that for years the Federal Government had taken New Mexico to

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration. Secretary of the Interior and the Chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure may provide that cooperation would be beneficial to the decision to consider this legislation today.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the relations of the gentleman from New York?  There was no objection.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|> false and misleading claims that the nominations of two outstanding Federal judges have been stolen from the Senate for the sole purpose of supporting their nomination and that nominations received awards under the law that can be rescinded have been given to career officials for their re-nomination. I am particularly troubled by this comment made by the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona. I have known Senator McCain for many years and have known him to be a fair and honest Senator. He has a record of good judgment. He has made no such comments.  The fact is that the administration has not used the law to justify these nominations. It has not abused the authority of the

Mr. President, I want to speak in support of the addition to the bill to permit the use of information technology in the census. As my colleagues know, this year the census will use information technology to count the population of the United States.  We know that the last census, conducted in 2000, was a monumental and historic achievement. However, the last census was flawed, and I believe the public has a right to know what they were asked to count. As such, the census must be fully electronic and fully computerized. The bill we are considering today, the CRS Act, is a reasonable step toward meeting this challenge.  The purpose

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the people of the Republic of Georgia in their struggle for democratic and parliamentary elections scheduled for October 18. Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives Irakli Hasin-Ini will be the next president of this year's elections. I support the upcoming elections in Georgia because they are critical to the survival of the Georgian people and the security of their neighbors. I believe the people of Georgia deserve a fair and transparent election.  This is a peaceful country, a nation where democracy has flourished, with elections and elections for president, assembly, and parliament. These elections should not be held to avoid civil unrest.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Chairman Goodlatte and the National Security Reform Act of 2009 legislation that will prohibit regulations that ``deem or provide for the limitation of the rights of United States citizens or naturalized citizens.''  The provisions of this legislation, and the subsequent legislation that we will be considering, are long overdue. The current regulatory environment is clearly out of control. Regulations that reduce our economic competitiveness, harm our national security, and, most importantly, harm American workers and businesses are being imposed on the American people.  In my home State of California, our economy is suffering from a slowdown in the construction industry. This slowdown

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close the debate on this rule and to the process that has served this country so well and to the people of the agricultural community for so many years.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3919.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.

As gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt) said in his opening remarks, these alliances and investments that have been made by the Federal Government are not just great for the American people, they are great for the world.  It is true that NPR has changed the way we listen to our own communities. It has provided a rich source of information and entertainment for millions of Americans and millions of others around the world.  However, our Nation has made some very fundamental changes

Mr. President, today President Obama announced that Senator Obama will not seek reelection to the Senate next year because of his concern that the way this Congress is running its business could lead to a break in the advantage of millions of Americans who are struggling to make ends meet.  As a nation, we have a long history of providing assistance to those in need. For many, the reason they are unable to pay their rent or their mortgage is that they are not able to work because of their status as immigrants or because they have a disability.  In my home State of New Jersey, we have a long history of helping our neighbors who are unemployed and need assistance
