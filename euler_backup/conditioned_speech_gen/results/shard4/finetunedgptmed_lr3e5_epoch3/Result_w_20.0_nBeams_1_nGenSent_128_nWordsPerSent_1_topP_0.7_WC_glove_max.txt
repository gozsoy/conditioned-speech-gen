This increase will not only help millions of American workers who have been out of work for far too long, but it will also increase our economy and help our economy compete in a global economy.  Currently, there are nearly 8.5 million American workers who earn the Federal minimum wage.  If we are to fully benefit from the economic growth

It is not to be taken lightly.  But it seems to me that the Senator from Arizona has a very legitimate concern about whether or not we are really going to take into consideration the men and women who have volunteered to serve and who are serving in the Armed Forces of the United States.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, I would like to point out that I, too, was a sponsor of H.R. 1217, which was passed in the House by a vote of 406 to 1. I voted for that bill because I wanted to support the troops and the families who were the victims of this war.

Mr. President President administration regulations limit travel by foreign dignitaries to the United States. I am proud to cosponsor legislation that will repeal this restriction.  This legislation has a simple premise. It is about America. It is about America's greatness. And it is about America's greatness.  The President, however, wants to impose restrictions on the travel of foreign dignitaries to the United States. These restrictions are not about foreign policy; they are about politics.  In recent years, the travel ban on certain foreign dignitaries has been renewed several times. Most recently, the President's travel ban was renewed last year. Now,

He spent his life teaching history and civics at St. John's College in New York. He also taught in elementary schools and secondary schools throughout the United States.  In 1976, Bruce became the first person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize

One of the many things I learned while participating in the DCCYA is the importance of encouraging our young people to pursue higher education. A higher education is a pathway to a better life and to a better future. The Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics has identified an alarming number of young people entering college with a diploma or GED.  I believe we must provide more resources for students

<|endoftext|> Gentleman gallery persons, I want to give you a short, specific example. The gentleman from Florida [Mr. Gibbons] and I are both members of the Committee on Government Reform. We have been working on this legislation for the last couple of years.  This is a bill that deals with housing and is designed to give a small amount of help to local housing authorities and the Federal Government. In the last Congress, we provided $4 million to help housing authorities with the costs of constructing, rehabilitating, and maintaining housing for the elderly and the disabled.  This year we provided $3 million to the States for a wide range of

Last week, the President and congressional leaders promised seniors a plan that will fix the system. But the President and the House leadership have refused to offer a plan. Instead, they have passed a continuing resolution that will keep the current system in place for another year. That is what we have here.  We have waited 5 months to fix this broken system. It is time for the Congress to act and to fix it now.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If this provision passes, colleges would have to charge student loan borrowers higher rates than those in other debt categories.  This would be devastating to students, especially students from low-income families, many of whom do not have the means to pay for college.

There is a very good reason for this. Under the present system, when a person becomes a retiree, it is usually the employer that provides the pension for them. So if a person becomes a retiree, they get the pension from

welfare headed home 

Final sequence: 

<|endoftext|>Home Welfare headed for bankruptcy. This is what we are seeing on the horizon.  What this Congress is doing is denying benefits to people who are able to work. The unemployed are now being told by the Republican leadership that they cannot be hired and their benefits are going to go down. What is next?  This Congress is not interested in working with the President. The President and the Congress cannot agree on the most basic of matters. They cannot agree on basic needs of people in this country.  If we want to help those who are looking for a job, we need to have a debate about that. But the fact is, the

Mr. Speaker Committee Armed Services sits on the floor of the House of Representatives today, and the committee will be considering legislation which has nothing to do with our troops, but which has to do with our spending and, quite frankly, has nothing to do with our war in Iraq.  The bill before us today, H.R. 1271, the Freedom of Access to Court for Military Complaints Act, is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's clothing. The truth is, it is an attempt to undermine the integrity of the military justice system by delaying judicial review of some of the most egregious and troubling misconduct and abuses that have been perpetrated by the

The second lesson I learned was that the Republican budget cuts Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the rich.

Madam President States products smoking rates have increased, as have cigarette smoking rates. The increases are the result of factors beyond the control of the tobacco companies.  Smoking is the No. 1 killer of children under the age of 20. This legislation will help reduce that number by making it easier for kids to start smoking and keep it.  As for the so-called tobacco industry, they say it is not a problem. The tobacco industry has said that they do not like the legislation. I think they are wrong. The tobacco industry is opposed to this legislation.  What we are saying is, if you have a problem, don't give up on
