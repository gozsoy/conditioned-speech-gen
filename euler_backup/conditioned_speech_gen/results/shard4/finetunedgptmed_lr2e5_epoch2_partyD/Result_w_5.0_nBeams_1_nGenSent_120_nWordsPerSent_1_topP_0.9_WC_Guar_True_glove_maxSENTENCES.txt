As the Senate needed to be ready for Congress to meet for a period of time to meet obligations imposed on it by law relating to our Nation's obligations under the requirements of the Federal charter, President Obama proposed that Congress address the emergency funding request as expeditiously as possible.  That month Congress could expect an emergency appropriation request from the President for December 1, a rainy day, black Thursday for Federal funding, should Congress fail to act by

New York's home sales vacancies have not improved with the continued upturn in home prices, but the State's continuing supply of existing homes and rapid unemployment rate has driven demand to many for additional housing and other rental housing

Madam President, the bill that is on the floor today will change America's law enforcement policy for America's families and all Americans. It will improve communities across the country and it will support our law enforcement community.  Law enforcement is cornerstone of our national security. It is responsible for keeping our communities safe from the activities of violent criminals, making arrests on violent offenses and preserving the public's faith in our criminal justice system. Loren Mullin from our Capitol Hill Police Department told me about what the legislation will do. She said, ``The Criminal Justice Act will improve our public safety by giving our hardworking, patriotic

Mr. President, we are here to debate a very important issue--the Federal emergency declaration of a State that has been designated a disaster area in the Secretary of Agriculture's 4- page listing. My feeling is that this is the way the regulatory process should work. The regulations set forth in the administration's preparedness lists do not preclude the Secretary of Agriculture from responding to disasters in the event of a Federal emergency.  On behalf of Senator Lott, I believe we should be making this process consistent with the constitutional responsibility of the Government to protect the lives and property of its people.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, my amendment would simply direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a Federal mandate for energy efficiency in government buildings across the country. That is energy efficiency standards that are already required across industries in our country, especially in industries like manufacturing and construction where energy sector jobs are concentrated in States that have energy efficiency standards.  The amendment would also direct the Secretary of Energy to ask the American people to take action by demonstrating its commitment to finding new and innovative ways to reduce energy consumption.  This past summer, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an energy bill that calls for increased Federal investment in energy efficiency

The wealthy children on the top end have the money and the power to avoid a mandatory minimum sentence for their children's misdemeanors--which is not common sense.

He says, well, we will do it for the kids, we will do it for the teachers, and we will do it for the middle class.  Well, the President's deficit proposal was not what we said he was going to do; and then he calls up a really great chart that says the tax cut

Mr. Speaker, this week we saw the much anticipated Democratic health reform plan on the floor of the House of Representatives. If my colleagues are not as committed as they thought they would be to America's families, they know the promise is much more than ``quality'' health care. As we see so clearly throughout Roe v. Wade, the courts have undermined some of the most sacred foundations of American democracy, including abortion.  But after the Affordable Care Act was passed into law, Republicans took some decidedly non-American steps to undermine the protections of Roe v. Wade. First, they broke an unwritten Federal law

Mr. President, the Senate has already passed legislation to establish an independent task force on violence against women which I asked the House to consider last year when the bill was under consideration in the rule. That task force is now being reported by the House by a narrow margin of 100-51. That task force would be the attorney general's commission on violence against women which will make recommendations for national policy, prevention activities and regulations. The Congress sanctioned this commission by providing its first-ever funding in fiscal year 1996 for $200,000. The task force will report to the Congress and will coordinate activities with the Justice Department

While this bill continues to look like the last Congress had the opportunity to floor a robust energy and transportation bill last year when Democrats controlled the House, yesterday the Senate did not have the opportunity to consider the bill in committee before giving up the Senate bill to conference committee representatives.  It is ironic that the majority leader of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has agreed to a bill that will cause disastrous consequences to the health and the environment of American families.

But we are working to address all veterans needs in our health care system.  We hear from them--they come from Ohio, from my home State of Indiana--that they will lose their health care if we adopt the proposal of my amendment. They want us to put in place,

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation which would extend the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act through March 31 of next year. This important legislation extends the Federal Government's economic assistance and tax breaks to middle-class Americans by the Democratic majority, and I urge Republicans to vote for this bipartisan extension of the highway and transit programs as well.  We must pass this bill in order to restore millions of jobs and pay down the national debt. This bill will ensure that all Americans have access to safe, reliable roads and mass transit services. It will create the first deficit reduction in the Nation's history,

If we take the statutory funding of the intelligence agencies and we then look at the cost, there is no security for this
