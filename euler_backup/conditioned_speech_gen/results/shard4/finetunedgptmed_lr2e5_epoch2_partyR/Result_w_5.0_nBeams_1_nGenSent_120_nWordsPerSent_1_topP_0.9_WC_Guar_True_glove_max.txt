In my district alone, almost 900 students have outstanding Federal student loans.  As we look forward

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator Bill Dodd and to ask my colleagues to join me in taking this opportunity to pay tribute to Senator Dodd in his retirement after many years of public service to our country and the people of this great country and care for others.  Senator Dodd has an extraordinary record of accomplishment in his 28 years of public service. He started at the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, Kyl Lane, then joined the Republican National Committee. He went on to serve as an assistant to the Republican Majority Leader in the Senate, my colleague, Dick Gephardt, and in 1998, for

Although we have argued variously on this floor this week and over the last several weeks about various provisions in the legislation and how they arranged themselves, we should note that the general agreement we reached last night was that the bill is, or should be, taken up as if at a House meeting that was before the general election.

Madam Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for offering this amendment that will help lower gas prices and will also allow American families to keep more of what they pay for their bill. This is one of those rare bipartisan ideas that can work on both sides of the aisle and that really does not require America's Government.  We all know that an American family simply cannot afford the high prices they are paying in the gas market. Think about that. Gas prices have nearly tripled since the U.S. Census Bureau put the national average price of gas at $3.84 a gallon. Americans are paying about $

Mr. Speaker, it has been a little over 3 months since the American people have had to endure the government shutdown in which Members on both sides of the aisle of Congress had to act in a manner to enact a balanced budget bill to reauthorize and fund our national Government. Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid have all joined together in trying to get the American people to blame other people when government takes a back seat to the private sector, working on a system of payment that will increase their wages and benefits for people who have worked hard for more than a year and more than a month just to be paid a fair wage

Mr. President, first, I thank President Obama for allowing me to return to the Senate to address the war on terror. He has clearly recognized our fight in Iraq as a war that must be fought on both fronts in a time of war that bill of rights advocates have always fought for and the United States of America has fought for for many years in a time of peace recognition.  His President's budget, the 2007 budget, provides our troops and their families with the resources necessary to be successful and to win the war in Iraq. It also sets a goal for increased efficiency and savings that result from robust programs.

Mr. President, the Senator from Maine is not arguing for a further debate on this issue because the committee has already asked for additional time and additional discussion on this issue for both the fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 1998 budget deficits in the Department of Defense budget context and the needs of the Department for the estimated 7 million dollars interest payments on the debt held by the Federal Government for the debt for the debt that Congress raised by $200 billion trillion to the economy in 2001.

There is a very good reason that the amount of money in this bill cut from our intelligence bureaucracy is in fact $39 million. One is because the highest priority is what we

This amendment would simply create a 1-year increase in the minimum wage. But many who are supporters of this amendment realize that this increase will have an unintended and devastating effect on small business owners and small accountsants.  Every few years we pass some type of

This is just one of a number of concurrent legislative actions that have moved our Nation away from the age of free thought and our history of no substitute for that of the United States as the preeminent world beacon of democracy. We may not always see eye to eye on many issues, but we can never, ever put our faith above others.  In this very Chamber,

Mr. Speaker, in the coming months this body will be considering another critical national security bill, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. This year we have strong support from the American people for this legislation.  This legislation will eliminate some of the more burdensome Government regulations and abuse of power that now corrupt American businesses. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act will correct many of the distortions in this dangerous and inherently unfair system. This bill will help American business to protect its financial interests and reduce needless Government regulation.  Over the next several months this body will take a variety of actions to consider this important legislation

<|endoftext|> amendment No. 3545 offered by my good friend from North Carolina deals with a problem that is very important to the people of North Carolina. It is an amendment that concerns myself and many others that have worked in this area of immigration reform.  It is a technical amendment that would, for the first time in our Nation's history, give illegal immigrants who are illegal immigrants permanent residency status that would allow them to become a full-time citizen. The intent is to put an end to the delay of citizenship and to allow immigrants who are already legal and who are lawfully in the United States to become citizens

This is a career career for my friend from Grand Rapids, and he is truly one of the true leaders of this body and a very, very powerful Member of this House.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The reason we have the budget going to 6 years is so that we have time for them to come

To some Americans, this stands as proof that Republicans are the major problem.  But to most Americans, this stand of fact proves only one thing. That we are responsible.  Now, every time there is a tax increase, President Clinton and Democrats in the House and Senate are always there to lecture the American people about the burden on the taxpayers.  Well, what has happened since Republicans have come to the Senate?  The Washington Post

Mr. Speaker, when the Speaker and I discussed the motion to instruct the Senate to consider the resolution before us today, I stated that this would be a significant step forward in the resolution's relationship with the Iranian regime which has prevented sanctions from being lifted over Iran in the past and Libya under General Muammar Qadhafi.  However, since this year, our side has been hit with new reports and allegations from whistleblowers which cast even more doubt over the Speaker's assertions about the need for these sanctions. The evidence which the Speaker now relies upon revolves around the secret flights to Iran which were suspended by Iranian President

More people are home with their families and paying less for gas, they are enjoying lower fuel prices, fewer sales, fewer complaints about dirty air and higher economic growth.  We also saw that following the tax increase, a 3.1 percent national unemployment rate fell to 6.4 percent, and that even before the tax increase

This week we will follow that up with an important briefing in the Office of the Secretary of Defense where we will be asked about the most urgent concerns in Iraq and the strategy we are considering there, and then the month of September will also be a time when the Congress

Mr. President, first of all, I would like to address the amendments that have been proposed here. They are serious amendments, and they require serious legislation, and they do require a vote on the floor of the Senate. If these amendments are adopted, the next vote will be the one to cut off appropriations and fund domestic programs.  As has already been explained, I have been working very closely with Senator Inouye, my good friend from Hawaii, in a spirit of bipartisanship on these issues, and I believe that my friends on the other side of the aisle are sincere in the preservation of

That plan never came to fruition.  The other thing that the Democrats have said since they

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to make a few comments on a bill which we are working on here in the Senate today which will increase the funding for the Endangered Species Act and other similar laws for many years to come and will do so with the support of both Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber and around the country as long as it is passed by this Congress. I would be the first to admit that amendment after amendment I have voted for in the past, with some minor amendments, the intent of which may be disagreeable, sometimes.  But, nevertheless, there are some things

It is a sobering study,

Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on a bill to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy and to strengthen the President's initiative to address the drug epidemic in this country through the President's drug interdiction and law enforcement strategy and the President's plan to begin the first phase of late-term abortions of unborn babies. There is a strong likelihood that this legislation will pass the Senate without any intent to undermine that effort or that portion of President Clinton's plan that would cut off Federal funds to Planned Parenthood, as my colleagues all know.

Mr. President, the reason we have come to this amendment is that although the law now requires the President to make a report on each year that he has been in office before he can state that he has not met the number of troops required for national security, there is no requirement in this legislation. In many cases, the legislation says:  If you don't have the numbers that Congress wants to know about, the report has to say so.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This bill does not cost Medicare recipients one dime. It creates a savings of $39 billion over the next 5 years. It increases Medicare costs for seniors.

The suspect was only in his early 20s, and one of the victims was in her own privacy until the very end, but she is a devoted mother and an officer in the Georgia Highway Patrol. She is certainly shaken by this, and she wants to be sure her family is taken

Mr. Speaker, this House has a long way to go to improve the lives of our men and women in uniform and to ensure that they travel in the safest manner possible so that they do not become casualties in battle.

This is about recognizing and recognizing the fact that highway congestion is, at best, going to get worse, and, at worst, it will continue to get worse.  These 7 minutes are based on $19 billion in highway trust fund revenues over the past

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the Energy bill to limit funding for the newly announced Global Life Sciences Institute to $14 million. This is an important program and has the potential to bring new and crucial research and management of one of the world's most pressing health and economic challenges President Bush promised would be addressed at the World Health Assembly in New York this week and also at the floor of the U.N. General Assembly in September.  The world is facing the ``Serbia Syndrome,'' as it was put by a former Clinton administration adviser, Dr. Bruce Graham, in his 1991 book ``

Mr. President, the Federal Government cannot or should not assume responsibility for all health care costs but that Congress is, and should be. That is why I have introduced the ``Health Care Security and Health Care Rights Act of 1996.'' Americans should be the primary voters in this institution and they should be guaranteed to know how Congress is handling health care issues and should be persons who have a direct role in their Government. The national health care system that we have today is bad for America, especially the millions of Americans who do not receive proper health care services and who are most exposed to the adverse health consequences of government policy.

It is unfortunate that it is the only proposal that has been offered. In fact, it is laughable that this is the only bill before us today.

It is significant. It cuts benefits for seniors who might save $2,000 per year on their deductibles, but for Medicaid beneficiaries, it actually cuts that benefit by an average of 3.2 percent. The end result is more seniors will have to pay higher taxes and, certainly, we have increased the deficit.  The money we are cutting here in this bill is for seniors who receive some of the largest and most expensive health care in the Nation,

Mr. Speaker, the term ``last week's news'' seems to have turned into ``good news last Thursday night.'' The last week was always an interesting one for the floor of the House of Representatives. House Republicans worked diligently and brought back from the dead an overwhelming and bipartisan majority when we sent our colleague from California, Nancy Pelosi, to the House of Representatives.  The House is now back in session. We can get to work. No more quibbling with President Clinton, no more closed doors negotiations, and certainly no more pretense of political gamesmanship.  Mr. Speaker, I want to once

Mr. President, since the passage of the 2001 Foreign Operations and Export Financing Reform Act last year, I have stood for a goal of reform of foreign aid and have raised concerns about some of the current funding in the bill for programs for American companies and $300 million for Defense Department programs.  The concern with earmarking programs from our allies and one of the biggest disappointments of the bill is that the $300 million earmarked for this program was allocated at a time when there were negotiations on military troop levels for combat forces in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf. This agreement was struck in 2004 and I believe
