state bill chairman 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP remains below 5 percent over the next 10 years. Under the bill and under current law the Commerce Department has proposed that we have to make the State transition and the process for Federal ownership of public utilities be completed within 5 years if that is the best economic case for the nation and our national interests and national security. Chairman Dingell's bill achieves these goals and recognizes that we have to be judicious and responsible stewards of the power of public resources if the American people are going to have as much power as possible.  Let's be very clear about the chairman's goals. If we are to balance the budget and if we are to keep our children and our grandchildren safe from those who would destroy the world economy and pull the United States further away from our historic role as an important

state ban alabama 

Final sequence: 

There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban in Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that State law prohibits the use of partial-birth abortions on healthy babies. That ban was overturned by the Alabama Supreme Court and the Federal District Court in New Orleans. They decided to reverse it. The remaining bans that are currently on the books are being upheld by the courts.  Alabama's partial birth abortion ban went out of existence. The Federal District Court's ruling came about only after States had already taken the action that they should have taken.  I am asking my colleagues to join me in supporting the remaining partial birth abortion bans on the books in Alabama and Louisiana and throughout the United States of America and why is it that it is legal in this country, after five decades, that we can't get rid of partial birth abortions in America?

Mr. President, in addition, I would like to clarify the intentions of the Fund for Public Broadcasting that they will not terminate funding for public television broadcasting to be used to provide program services to lower income groups without Government funding or tax benefits being included in the plan to plan to terminate funding for extension of public television broadcasting in 1997.  I ask that the statement by the President be corrected to clarify that ``early-runspaper programs were not included in the fiscal year 1995 Community Television/Early/Meal Radio/Education/Newspaper/V/P/V//V/Fra fra'' (Broadcast Family Program or Heritage/Community Development/Public Broadcasting) budget.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, let me pick up on a point that the gentleman has made. In California we have actually tried to have these programs in every county in the State for the last few years now. The communities that I represent are doing very well, particularly in my State in my own community in the San Francisco Bay area that is one of the biggest in the country today in terms of population, in terms of jobs. I think that we need to continue this program to allow the communities to continue to grow, to reiterate the administration's order, and to simply continue to say to those in this country that we want to extend this for as long as they can possibly grow. That is the direction that we need to go.  I am happy to yield to the gentleman.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, it is our intention to lay down the Glenn substitute today. Senator Glenn of North Dakota will bring his amendment to the Senate floor later this afternoon or early evening. We hope to be able to have the debate between now and 2 or 2:30 this afternoon on the Glenn amendment and some of the differences that have been resolved. So I have no further comments that I would like to make for the time being relative to the agreement that has been given to the two leaders because that agreement has not been yet given to the absence of Senators who wish to speak on the Glenn amendment.  I know the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee and the ranking member of the Banking Committee will return tomorrow and the Senate will continue with the plan to debate the Glenn amendment on Monday. I thank Senator Dodd for his patience and cooperation.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, included in the Democrats' health plan are massive cuts to Medicare Advantage that are not only devastating to millions of seniors, but to low-income children and families that rely on the program for their health care coverage. The CBO estimates that this will increase the loss to seniors over the next decade from current beneficiaries by $12 billion.  Let me say for the record, this is not just a political promise. The impact of this proposed legislation will affect every single American and its values. We are asking seniors to pay a heavy price in order to preserve the Affordable Care Act and increase Medicare spending.  Despite repeated promises by Speaker Pelosi to protect seniors' guaranteed coverage through 2014, the Affordable Care Act will shift money and power from seniors to the doughnut hole and to insurance companies. Moreover, this irresponsible package of cuts would force

But that could be a limited debate time to allow Senators to either suggest amendments or to offer further amendments that can be offered prior to the time we come back this week that the extent of debate can be worked out.

Local water agencies that want to keep safe water supply can no longer just get it from the Federal Government that they would be able to use under the current law but is probably not going to be able to use it under this new legislation because it would be subject to effect of the State law and subject to rewrites and changes.  This amendment just says that when Federal funds come into an area under Eisenhower-Virtue act, in the 1970's, most probably there was some restriction on how much they could be used and they were then going to have to prove they were good stewards of those dollars. So that

Madam President, I announced this morning, though only Senator McConnell and I were on the floor, we have the McConnell-Lugar-Green amendment. It is to immediately proceed to passage of the Foreign Operations bill with an hour 30 minutes to be divided and controlled on each side, the remainder being the vote, the time being equally divided. This amendment has been worked out and will be modified to accommodate the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Oklahoma.  There are two versions of this amendment. The McConnell-Lugar-Green amendment will get first preference. I think, if we take these two amendments, we have now split the time equally on both sides. So all Senators will be presented with their amendment. We will have to modify this amendment once we get the McConnell-Lugar-Green amendment accepted so we can clear this

Madam President, George Washington once said of the Nation's flag, and I quote, ``Let us make no mistake about it. The American flag is for all time the standard by which we measure the integrity of this great Nation.'' Washington's sense of the nation is real to all of us, a symbol of our love of freedom and devotion to our country. It is a symbol that symbolizes triumph and glory, and the eternal task before the American people: to uphold its American ideals, preserve its distinctive character, and protect our great liberties.  The House of Representatives last night adopted a Resolution designating September 14, 2005, as Flag Day. The purpose of Flag Day is to draw attention to the solemn occasion, to honor the flag, and to remember its nearly 200,000 year history.  Congress first passed the Flag Protection Act on November

It happens there.

My position is it not be used. The budget--so far we had in the Budget Committee the budget scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation is an accounting problem because it has very large growth in the year 2001 and is very clearly in the deficit in the year 2002. The reason is because of growth in current budget revenues over a very long period of time that reflects a change in the tax base and the change in spending in a rapidly evolving economic situation. I would not commit the budget to that circumstance, but I can assure the distinguished chairman that I will not support a budget that adds anything over $25 billion to that bill, especially if it adds any more. I will support the chairman's recommendation to eliminate or drastically reduce the appropriation for expenditures, if it is justified and in the interests of maintaining the deficit reduction objectives.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Now I know you think we can reverse that just because we are just short of the Presidential election, but I think this administration has not done anything to make the transition from the old system of gerrymandering to the new one of proportional representation, because they voted the previous election in December of 2002 to have that broken down.

Research is being conducted at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, at universities across the United States and the world to measure the effect of human activity on our climate system and its effect on the Great Lakes and the world as a whole. It has passed with overwhelming support in the State of New York, in the State of Connecticut and in other states throughout the country and in training and preparation of the international community.

The current welfare system is overburd ensure a welfare dependency of $4.6 billion a year and fails to provide assistance for serious medical problems like alcoholism and addiction, or incarceration. It fails to effectively control illegitimacy by discouraging unmarried people from having children. It fails to promote work by leading the way to high-skilled jobs, jobs that require education and skills. It fails to properly discipline irresponsible parents by failing to place more responsibility on fathers. It fails to encourage welfare reform by creating a dependency on the Federal Government.

The Senate voted unanimously to advance this nomination last week after committee action of the same number of days ago. Since that time there has been some debate about the confirmation of this latest nominee, but the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, have vigorously supported the confirmation of this nominee. He is a judicial nominee we believe should get a vote. I hope the other side of the aisle will help this nominee.  We have talked about Mr. Bridget Bade for 2 years now

Our constituents want leaders who will make the tough decisions to make the country better for them and for their children, but we have seen too many Presidentially appointed members of our judicial body who are among the most difficult and partisan to work with in both the majority and the minority and are an obstacle to the American people from even getting the judges they want and deserve for themselves and their children and women who call America home.  Recently, after a very public disagreement between a junior Senator from California and a senior Senator from California, I took the unusual action of submitting a discharge petition which would have granted the removal of Miguel Estrada from the court.

Mr. President, today I wish to discuss Americans' access to healthcare and patient protections that are in our Affordable Care Act in the context of legislation that I am proposing that the President will sign today to protect those protections. I also am pleased that in this legislation we have been able to advance important issues such as increasing access to private plans and increasing access to Medicare to all of our country's citizens through government policy rather than administration policy.  During the first 100 days of this administration, I have been working with the President and with our Republican and Democratic colleagues to work together to expand access to insurance coverage for uninsured individuals and families.

I say to my friend, this Sunday's Super Bowl will add a final chapter to this saga for the Seattle Seahawks and the Raiders who have been a match made in heaven since it was first put together when they got together in the Chargers office in January of 1994. We are not even into the first game yet this year, but the story has been pretty good so far for the NFL and the union who have brought this tale to a close and who have been so kind as they have done it while the entire country had their eyes turned to the horizon.  All the players who have been victimized were not given the chance to play their games anyway, and it is clear that, once the person who laid the block on everyone else was let out, they would come back because if they were not allowed to play their games, the rest

It occurred after we had had a chance to talk about it because the most profound moment for me in my life came during Thanksgiving weekend.

Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Render to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Barton] Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to Mr. Veasey's amendment.

Madam President, I rise today to offer this amendment because I am concerned about the abuses that occur when companies are given financial benefits from the Congress when they do not have to share them with other customers or even the government agencies who are given that benefit in the first place. This amendment increases the public disclosure rate to make the Pentagon and the Government Accountability Office better able to hold executives accountable to the public interest by requiring those reports to be posted on their website on a quarterly basis so that the public can see that rate rise.  Companies that are receiving such financial support from the government are more than eager to work with the administration to ensure they receive these benefits from graduates, grant recipients, contractors, and small businesses. The Pentagon has well documented examples of companies that get lucrative benefits from the federal government and then claim they never had to share

This is a national security issue. The U.S. military has demonstrated every time they have been in a combat situation, if they are out at great risk, it seems that the only way they can continue to protect us is by having weapons that can protect us.

It is critical to understand that there is a degree of instability on the ground that will require, not only economic reform, but broader reforms in the areas of human rights and diplomacy. The first of these measures is action by the Iranian government in compliance with international law and norms regarding human rights.

Madam Speaker, House Democrats' fiscally irresponsible budget will impose on American workers and businesses a $1 trillion tax hike on working Americans and consumers. It means spending American families' hard-earned tax money on government-funded social programs that would not work and would be less productive or save taxpayer dollars to the government rather than to Congress. That is the Democrat plan for taking from American families and businesses that invest and create the next generation of economic success. Speaker Pelosi and President Obama have created a temporary tax break for millionaires, a loophole which would cost $83 billion over the next 10 years. So much for the 'tough choices' that the President made when he sent his budget proposal to Congress.

I know that the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, is here on the floor to speak about this issue as well and in response to my question about the fact that the States should be able to take the funds that are raised in this way and put them toward their own priorities because there is also concern that this money could be used to take money that should be going to interest on our debt and provide $500 a month to the State of Michigan to help them pay down their debt. We have to put a stop to that Levin. The money should be used to assist the citizens of Michigan. We must put a stop to the Levin amendment. It is outrageous, and, frankly, it is irresponsible.

On February 15, 2015, Dabiq, which is the sort of public newspaper of ISIS, published an article entitled ``A Man Offset by the Group War Against Civil Society and the Communities of the Middle East.'' It stated that its aim was to bring the citizens of the area under the control of the Islamic State and then put them to work building public housing. That is why it should come as no surprise that it is not so much a surprise to see that a video of this very well hope, ``To fight the oppression of Muslims in Iraq and Syria,'' was posted on the internet, showing just what the Dabiq Front would look like under its new leader.  Of course, there was nothing on the frontline of the Islamic State like the video; and the relatively civilized area of Mosul would not be filled with streetcars, parking lots

What we have is taxpayers being asked to pay for the fossil fuel companies to do something which we know won't do anything but produce more carbon than they need to generate revenue legitimately to pay for the interest they owe.

opposition direct reluctantly 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in direct opposition to the amendment, and I rise with respect to the amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the committee on our side of the aisle. Let us be very clear about what the opposition to the amendment actually is. The administration would not support the amendment for three very simple reasons. No. 1, because of direct outlay by the Federal Government that the administration insists upon declaring ``excess and unnecessary'' so that we can give reluctantly support to that spending, because we do not believe it is in the interest of this country, we do not believe it is in the interest of the taxpayers, and we do not believe it is in the interest of the soldiers, sailors, airmen who are sacrificing their lives for this country. No. 2, because the Federal Government does not need to pay

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the U.S. Postal Service is a fundamental part of our Nation's history and cultural legacy. The Postal Service has helped provide essential access to important government services such as paying taxes and paying for a community's basic needs. This service also serves as a convenient way for rural communities to get daily newspapers, newspapers they can easily find, and keep tabs on their activities. These people who use the Postal Service help make America the great, great country it is today.  Over the years, Federal programs have taken the role of Postal Service and the public's overburdened mail system as their top priorities, and I am disappointed that the Appropriations Committee's budget includes a very small sliver of money for the Postal Service. I call on the Appropriations Committee to drop its obstructionist approach to the Postal Service.  Despite the good work

However, what I will suggest is that we can find a way that we can work together to try to find that balance between pay-as-you-go and some of the savings we will be able to extract from this Government that we cannot use to offset the billions of dollars

We could spend it all on our kids.  If we are going to pursue education, the program that we're sending, we should be doing it for the kids. We have not, but we do know the Federal Government should be doing it for the kids.  I think this is the other point I want to make. This is not where this country should be going to help.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great arguments that I have heard in this debate about welfare reform is how easy it is to get involved in a family situation and then get involved in the government and become involved in the business of the Government and pay taxes that help pay for that family and work that family. This is what we are talking about in Washington today is a real jobs program where instead of the welfare welfare benefits payments just the college wages that are for the education of the child, there are also welfare payments as benefits to get that child out of welfare and into work.  Mr. Speaker, the welfare system as it is presently constructed in this country is not working very well. It makes children in this country do better in school than in the private schools; in almost every other field. Those who have had more education in this

If a bill is marked up and nothing else is in the bill, but if amendments are listed on the bill, the amendment that has already been put in the bill cannot be voted on.

As the author of the Personal Health Technology Act, I fought many years before for the effective transfer of royalty-free patents for medical innovations. Patent transfer has yielded vast benefits to innovation that could never be discovered or exploited by larger companies or by specialized innovators.  This bill provides one last opportunity for companies that already have intellectual property rights to transfer such IP that companies cannot effectively prevent litigation when they reap the economic benefits they have already won.  Earlier this year, I introduced similar legislation, H.R. 2147. H.R. 2147 calls for

He and all Americans lost their faith in our ability and desire for freedom and passion to find our way out of the shadow of a despot bent on our destruction.

I want to commend the National Park Service and the Wildlife Conservation Fund for taking a serious approach to helping these five national parks to increase their availability of duck hunting and conservation opportunities for local families to enjoy the full range of its natural beauty and resources which rise from their treasured mountain ranges.  Last year this bipartisan bill passed the House on a bipartisan vote of 244-196. Today the Senate will continue to take up and pass similar legislation.  There are many aspects of this bill that I am particularly interested in, and I would like to focus on some of the highlights of this bill for this evening's debate.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding me time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Obey amendment and to the public schools charter school legislation.  The underlying bill does not reform our public education systems. Instead, it ties private school vouchers to private school funding and does nothing to reform the way public education funds are spent and where funds are yielding results. It also leads to public school parents coming up to Members of Congress and asking Congress to cut their taxes or to give it away. Chairman Obey seems to think that when we tax the government, when we borrow money from foreign governments, when we create all kinds of new problems, that somehow public education is somehow something special. That is why he and I can get along together on education policy. That is what makes us strong.  We are right now

I was not able to attend the hearing but was happy to witness his bravery and dedication in action.  Sergeant Leto, of Audubon, Tennessee, is remembered by his family and friends as a distinguished soldier and a true hero. The Army cited his actions as the act that saved others from the enemy.

For years now, terrorists have been using different vehicles to carry out attacks against the American people. We know that the D-9, the cruise missile, and the bomb is still the weapon of choice of today's terror network. But this weapon has also been deployed in other ways. Terrorists have ordered the targeting of American interests overseas. These attacks, if successful, can cripple the region and the security of the United States, which places America in danger.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the conference report on the National Highway Traffic Safety and Security Act of 1994 which the conference report includes severe and unnecessary cuts to Highway Safety Agency funding. The Highway Safety and Security Act makes many changes in vehicle safety that were not in the legislation reported by the Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee on May 26 in its past two decades of operation of that committee which reports to the Senate only annually after accidents on the Interstate System.  As chairman of the subcommittee, I was pleased to offer this amendment that was adopted to provide important additional funds for the enforcement of vehicle inspection laws on Federal highways. The elimination of provisions mandating inspections by State and local agencies on trucks carrying heavy loads was intended to provide more safety. In many cases, these inspectors spend hours in the field putting out fires, tampering

service wisdom accounts 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to state the obvious, but an obvious part of the good news today about a good life for an American family is the retirement savings accounts. As the numbers of working Americans show, many of them are saving for retirement, and that will save them and their families all kinds of years in the future when we need them the most. We know this is the service they need to help them and their families with their present circumstances, that they need those kind of retirement opportunities available that our good wisdom can guarantee will enable them to enjoy better lives in the future.  Those savings accounts come into play during the early years of a retirement program. Here is one place where many working Americans are faced with problems for which no less than the Government ought to be involved. They are faced with problems that no

I wish to tell the Senate I hope it was worth it, I wish to hope this one is an exception to the rule, but the record we have got tells me otherwise. This nominee, Scott Baker, will soon be confirmed, this day is coming, and it is the only thing that we have to do, before the recess, and that is to do what we have done in the last 18 years

For many Iraqis, the days of Saddam's existence seem like a distant memory. On August 6th, a brave Kurdish fighter jet downed four armed helicopters and took down two former foreign military vehicles. On August 15th, coalition forces entered al Anbar province. On August 22, Iraqi police forces successfully arrested a prominent Shiite cleric from Najaf for being part of a militant group that espouses violent extremism.  America is facing a new kind of enemy on the battlefield, not Saddam Hussein's but insurgents and extremists inspired by Osama bin Laden and other extremists around the globe.

During the spring and summer of 1897 the Tech faculty and administration led the first National Association of Colleges and Universities to declare that it wanted to do something to increase its academic standing. The Association welcomed congratulations from distinguished Georgian constituents, including the Governor of Georgia, the President of Georgia, and the chairman of the State college board of trustees. Georgia Institute of Technology was formally incorporated in the State of Georgia on April 3, 1897. Today, the school has grown to be one of the leading centers of excellence in higher education.  Mr. President, there is no doubt that Georgia Tech is on a higher plane than many other schools in this country. But the significance of Georgia Tech is not in its

It is a bipartisan bill that includes a great many Republican amendments that were offered by Democrats and Republicans alike and passed out of the Senate unanimously over the past year. It is widely supported by the Nation and popular with the public.  The purpose of this legislation has always been to facilitate the operation of our forces in Iraq so they have the tools they need to accomplish their schemes of nation building and reconstruction. This is the beginning of our mission in Iraq, and it is a mission the administration, the Congress, and the public believe will succeed.

But the people of the country have a different answer to that question. Their answer is, ``No, Mr. Speaker. We don't believe that Republican leadership will just shut the government down for 10 days.  To this extent the Republicans' current shutdown of the Federal Government is just like the most recent Republican standoff with the State of Michigan. The Republicans just say, ``Let's shut the Government down.''  Why would they do that?

trillion anniversary great 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I now choose to turn to another topic--a topic that is important to all Americans. This will be the 10th anniversary of the Great Society Program. This program we have spent trillions of dollars. We continue to add billions of dollars, but the time has come to pause for a moment, and to remember the true beneficiaries of the Great Society Program. Today, I wish to commemorate a significant milestone for all Americans.  On May 1, 1996, 15 years ago, President Clinton signed into law the bipartisan 1965 Welfare Reform Act. The $5.5 billion appropriated for the welfare program was considered one of the largest and most successful social engineering programs ever enacted.  For these very reasons, many people across America continue to have deep reservations about the U.S. welfare system. While millions of Federal workers have received permanent

The leadership has been very active in the first part of the year in preparing for this Army Corps of Engineers conference. I want to thank the chairman, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Barton], for a role that we have taken in developing this bill over the last 2 years.

The Senator is quite right, with this one exception: We have provided ourselves with universal coverage for the American people. If you think about this for a second--and we should not take this to the public because we do not want Government involvement with this question at all--the Senator from Iowa mentioned Americans do not pay for Medicare. We have a solution. We have used private insurance and there has been virtually universal coverage in America for the American people.  What is wrong with this basic point: The Senator from Illinois has said it in her comments. Let me repeat it: The Senator from Illinois has said it. Let me repeat it:  We have paid for Medicare by asking the taxpayers to make the choice. They have taken that choice and said: Do you want Medicare or do you want private insurance?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

What is important, that I would remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that the Journal article which today is being cited, and maybe it is not appropriate in today's context, I do not know. But by almost a 3-to-1 margin people who support reform vote for reform. That is basically what the Journal article is saying.

It is the Federal Government and its Congress that have a far greater debt problem than any other American country.  Because of balancing the budget, the Federal Government has the ability to provide billions of dollars to States and municipalities that will provide jobs and economic opportunity, investment and improvements, because they save the taxpayers dollars in the long run.  The American people want the Federal Government to balance its budget. They want it to pay its bills. They want it to honor its promises. The American people are demanding that they be allowed to operate under the same laws, only under certain conditions, only if the changes necessary to achieve this goal occur.

Food stamps is simply not enough to satisfy their needs because the people of this country will not expand if we do not provide more help to these individuals so that they can keep their families together and not stress out a very small business, a family-owned business, like my good friend from New York, not because they will not give up their business.

I do not agree with that adage. Congress passed the Federal budget amendment of 1997. No other part of the budget was subject to this same tax fairness dictate. There are some other parts of the budget that are subject to some measure of tax fairness that Members should consider if they weaken those same budget provisions that apply to the other committee provisions and the budget amendments. It is one of the reasons that Representatives of the taxpayer deserve to be represented. It is also one of the reasons that we should be here to work with the other body to make changes.

Mr. President, this past week, a Republican-led Senate Committee held a hearing on the business of taxes. The goal of this hearing was to engage in a debate on the merits of the tax bill that is now being considered by the House of Representatives.  Members of both political parties spoke at the hearing, all with the objective

Mr. Speaker, I have a deep and abiding respect for our flag and what it represents as a flag of democracy and freedom and the freedom of many in this Nation and in many parts of the world and the patriotic ways in which it represents those very principles. It has been my privilege to see this cut and to know its meaning in the family relationships, and I know that many veterans of World War II and Civil War times in times of great emotion are very involved in their country's efforts to get the word of the flag restored and to continue and to raise, not only the remembrance of those fallen but their efforts to bring about changes to preserve this symbol of democracy and freedom. So I rise today to once again take a moment to stand in support of H. Res. 752.  As many of you know, this resolution

Mr. President, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, it is so remarkably easy from time to time to make it easier to put our tax dollars to good use. As I sit here on the Senate floor today President Bush is doing just that. Just today he sent out a whole series of very nice things that he certainly knew I would like if I thought it was a pretty terrible idea to provide very inadequate tax relief for some of the worst Americans in our country and have that taken care of for their own tax purposes so they could work more so that they could get by so that they could put more so that they could put flawed programs into place that allowed them to cheat the American people out of some very small amount of money in order to keep the tax breaks for wealthy people at the top.

Mr. Chairman, I would tell the gentleman, I was referring to the employee teams and the pay commission and the pay that would be given as to the employee teams because that is the people who we think will benefit from that employee incentive that is in this bill that we offer and is referred to in this debate. I would say that employer benefits already are going to get a boost because the exclusion applies to the private sector in terms of the wages and benefits that are included in there.  Da'watkha is vanishing. Unions are collapsing. There are going to be the payoffs, or the kind of payoffs that would be just totally wrong, really, if that policy was extended. So in terms of adding any extra benefit to employee teams, there is nothing in this amendment that changes that.  Now, I

removing stand colleague 

Final sequence: 

Madam Chair, I stand in opposition to the amendment offered by my dear colleague, Mrs. Johnson from Minnesota. I stand in opposition because it essentially strikes from this bill specific authority to establish another means of removing a health threat, and I oppose it because we already have a great deal of this authority from previous appropriations bills and from prior law.  I thank my colleague for his statement. I support his position. We have also included language in the bill to impose the 5-year sunset and time period on all expiring provisions of this bill for the last 5 years, and that is a reasonable approach to dealing with a number of common-sense issues.  I again emphasize that I am very much in support of legislation like this. I think we need to carefully address the financial obligations and a number of the other issues that are in this

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system that was based on social control and social commitment could be a powerful economic force in American history and in America's economic future as well. Roosevelt proposed a plan to reform the Nation's welfare system that would guarantee that the American people would have an opportunity to pursue the American dream by working for a better life through work and education and united States citizenship. That is how a great American--America's dream--became a reality.  In the months before he died, Franklin Roosevelt warned of the dangers of the continuing train of the welfare state in making the American dream more available to more people and less successful. He clearly understood the promise of a welfare system that would provide incentives for work and training and education, so that those on the lower rung of

Mr. Speaker, last Friday, I was honored to join EPA Region 7 Administrator Jim Gulliford to host a district office tour at EPA headquarters in Washington. I was also impressed by the Federal Government's dedication to protecting our waters, and the importance of reducing mercury and other harmful pollutants from our rivers and streams and the air we breathe.  Mr. Speaker, Jim and his staff have been working for years on eliminating mercury and other neurotoxic pollutants from the Great Lakes. In fact, the EPA has actively funded the Great Lakes Initiative since it was started in the 1980's.  The scientists and engineers of the EPA at Region 7 have worked to make the Great Lakes one of the premier model countries for reducing mercury levels in the lake. The Great Lakes will be able to close the mercury gap in a cleaner environment, and saving millions of American jobs

It will be extremely helpful in their fight against terrorism and violent crime that we face.  It is our obligation to rebuild America and we need to do it right now. The Bush administration, this administration, and this Republican Congress have made a mockery of this Constitution.

There's something going on here, and we have an opportunity to really reform health care to make it more affordable and more accessible.

administration truth gap 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the credibility gap is growing. First the administration said the U.S. had to provide financial assistance for war victims and now we see truth. Last year President Bush asked Congress to authorize the administration to provide $11 billion to Iraq. Yet more funds have been cut and already one-third of the money gap has closed. The United States cannot be expected to impose its will when the U.S. taxpayer pays for an Iraqi citizen's crime. Last year only one-third of the money was being provided. Two-thirds of it is now required to rebuild Iraq. The question is: ``What is more important, securing a financially solvent Iraq and preventing a morally bankrupt America?''  The American people want the truth and to be able to know what went wrong in Iraq. American taxpayers are in no position to feel good about

The special relationship between the United States and Japan is one of the most vital in the world today. Our two militaries have worked closely on many issues--not the least of which is the cause of the ``comfort women.'' They and the rest of their countrymen owe our gratitude to the efforts of the President of the United States, George Bush, in recommending this measure to Congress in the hope that it will make a positive difference in the lives of the elderly people, the uneducated, and the disabled people who were victims of sexual exploitation

I have the greatest respect for my friends on both sides of the aisle on this issue of gun violence and in the days ahead, I hope they will be in the same situation as they are now and that they can come to some sort of agreement on how to move this issue forward that will also reflect that Mississippi was in the news again in recent days with a report that the child killed in the school was a 9-year-old girl and that we are going to keep this in perspective as to what we need to be doing in our society.  The President did have a very inspiring speech today, and I will not stop listening to him.

It is also important to note that since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom troops have liberated Iraqi civilians from Iraq since the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The services of the Armed Forces of the United States are in the midst of an enormous historical, tactical, and strategic challenge and thus require the finest, best trained, and best equipped forces in the world to carry it out. I rise today to support Operation Iraqi Freedom, but as America is fighting in support of our military efforts on the battlefield, I am mindful of the immense challenges and risks for our Nation.  Operation Iraqi Freedom is a historic moment. It is

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, who had the time in opposition earlier this evening and in support of this amendment, I rise to offer an amendment to the Defense appropriations conference report to provide the President the authority to designate a Federal work area in the District of Columbia. The committee amendment establishes a jurisdiction outside of the territory of the District of Columbia, the Eastern District of Virginia, a 5-year budget authority, and the authority to issue housing vouchers and use existing funds for D.C. apartment buildings and other housing purposes.  I think it is important to remember, as we are considering the District of Columbia appropriations bill, that it will not become law until we take care of housing vouchers and voucher funding for homeless families in the District of Columbia. It is important to remember that for far too long,

Section 552 of title 5 prohibits the discharge of any Federal official residing within the United States for engaging in unauthorized disclosures by the National Security Agency. Section 552 is also intended to exclude from the requirement of the Freedom of Information Act the acquisition of sensitive trade secrets by any Federal agency if such acquisition would interfere with the essential functions of the office.  The concern over this language stems from numerous private letters to and from Director McCone with regard to the proposed administrative transfer of the Office of Special Counsel for the National Security Agency.

Let me explain what the health care reform reform we will be voting on today will do because the moral authority of the American people demands it.  What the people who make up the Republican majority understand is that when the Republicans took the majority in the House back in 1995, we said this was the people's House.

Mr. Speaker, last week 20 House Republicans introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 per hour in the year 2001 or $13,500 per year in 2005 or $24,600 per year in 2009. Minimum wage raising would cause 15 percent of Americans earning over $20,000 to earn more in wages than in purchasing power.  Unlike my Republican colleagues who tried to kill this bill last week, I don't believe we should have a minimum wage increase just because the cost of living is so high in this country. In addition to the rising cost of living in this country, there are millions of working Americans out there who can't afford a minimum wage. In fact, in my home State of Michigan a minimum wage worker earns $5.45 an hour, one-third

Mr. Speaker, it is said that the rule on the bill should be called the Whitewater resolution because there is so much that is said that is not so very clear and not so well supported on both sides of the issue about what was really going on in this whole investigation that led to the appointment of the special counsel in the first place and has nations paying into a trust fund that has an additional cost to it because of the special counsel's appointment. That is not what the rule should be called as it should yield an open and open airing and not allow the whole investigation to be the subject of long and sometimes complicated and overburdened and China-bashing.

As the Chair of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight I rise in support of this bill to require all Federal agencies to tell us what they spent on Lewis and Clark or the similar expeditions. As well as information about the precise dates and times of the expedition, this legislation will allow the public to compare Federal agencies' spending on projects of similar merit.

Mr. Speaker, I will not yield. I did not use the gentleman's name in vain. I do not want to get into that this morning because it is already one of the most expensive amendments we will be dealing with here on the floor and perhaps the time will come when we will have to come to a vote on this opportunity to actually do something for people who need help and those who need help is what we are doing here because it is so much money.  So I will not yield to the gentleman.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. What we are considering here today is simply to put this bill on the books as well as having an option for the American people to have a check come in from the Treasury or the Speaker of the House or the Budget Committee and to have it before the Congress before we go to the next election time to be counted. The only opposition is coming from Members of the other side of the aisle who think, oh, well, we want to have a vote on the bill before we get a check in. So we want to take that money out of the Treasury and, therefore, we want to pass the legislation. That has not really been discussed. It was initially estimated that we could get 60 votes for an all-of-the-above bill.  It is simple

Today, we spend $1 billion more than last year on Federal transportation programs, corrections, and modernization of all Federal programs, except for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. While we have not had a new transportation bill this year, it was actually the 4th appropriation bill since 1993 to spend more money than last year.

Mr. Speaker, the crisis unfolding in Iraq is deeply troubling to the American people. The violence is only one part of the disturbing situation there. After Iraqi government forces met Islamic State on the battlefield and successfully defeated their fighters and captured two of them in the north of the country, that military conflict has now spread to several Shia Muslim provinces in the south and Christian minority areas in the north.  The violence is far from over, and the hard news is that the Islamic State has launched its third major attack on a Syrian speaker in recent days, apparently by preparing the attack. This sectarian violence has escalated from the attacks against Shiites and Christians to Shiite-Sunni killings. Many people are in the midst of very real fears for their lives as they await a sense of peace and security in their community.  This latest incident reflects the deteriorating

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 953, Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2008.  The Regulatory Enforcement in Regulatory-Federal Review Act would permit courts to review the use of agency rules and regulations in the other body and to apply these rules or regulations in the Federal courts under the Water Resources Development Act in the case where an agency regulation is found to have substantially affected interstate commerce and is therefore subject to Federal environmental laws and Federal environmental laws in the other State where the regulation was last in effect in California.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle point to the extraordinary problems with this legislation and say that it is needed to correct the regulatory stagnation which is so pervasive in this country. Indeed, this bill is geared toward fixing a problem which is likely to aggravate further and create a series of problems which are likely to

Madam President, I understand the Senator from Washington wishes to ask unanimous consent to go ahead with his amendment. I wish to talk a little bit about what he said that is one of the reasons I think it would be so great if we could come to an agreement as quickly as we can to get this done so we could move quickly on this manager's amendment and not have people waiting in line.  The reason I am reluctant to agree to that is the sense that I know the Senator has to say thank goodness that there are some important items on his amendment, particularly maybe Dodd-Frank, I know they are controversial. But I suppose it would be irresponsible for me to curscribe my friend Mr. Leahy Madame President, we have people that wish to speak on their amendments.

Madam Speaker, last week, the Sunshine State was devastated by the 393rd mass shooting of the year. A mass shooting at a school in Los Angeles and a bus station in Lake Tahoe resulted in the deaths of 31 people, including 19 children. It is clear that mass shootings are an emergency that affects our communities on a daily basis. Yet they don't have to be this way. My home State of Nevada's second largest city, Reno, has been through several mass shootings in its previous 12 years.

story shift worked 

Final sequence: 

This is no brag, just facts. This is a major story in American history. The story that our colleague from the other side of the aisle worked so hard on is that when the Democrats controlled Congress, there were bills that we could not get a vote on to make sure that it was a full dollar for all programs that all Americans would benefit from because that money is shifting in Federal programs from the hands of the Federal Government to the hands of the private sector.  I am talking about the issue of the trust fund. This is a key issue. The trustees are now at least as confident, perhaps even more so, as we were at that point last year that this trust fund is there to last a decade. The trust fund, as the Senator from Kentucky has described, does not have enough money to pay for those programs. The

That clean state has been by the great doctors in Louisiana, by the great physicians who have lived the story of their doctors over the years in the area of their health, and it has been in the tireless work of public officials who have the ingenuity to see this very significant problem solved.

Madam President, the war in Iraq is the greatest challenge facing our country. Unfortunately, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group that I chair recently released a comprehensive report on the potential for Iraq's political and economic transformation to change the direction of Iraq. This Iraq Study Group report was sent to President Bush during his second trip to Iraq in May of this year as part of our strategy to gain leadership in Iraq. It is crucial to recognize that Iraqis are committed to reconstruction, but are finding it difficult to give tangible help to reconstruction efforts. The economic indicators and security indicators in the Iraq Study Group report show that Saddam is not succeeding in reaching and improving economic growth, tax revenue, and social stability.  We are beginning to hear the comments from the administration that they are unwilling to make concessions to Baghdad. We should remember that we already gave Iraqis political and economic

updating speaker policy 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the current fiscal year. Policy reform is one of the most important aspects of this legislation. While Congress passed this bill almost 1 year ago, the Senate adjourned last month for an election year. I would hope that Speaker Gingrich and the other House Republicans would update our agriculture policy for the Senate this year in order to move this bill to the Senate's desk this fall.  I am pleased to report that we are going to pass agricultural reform, real reform, this fall. I applaud the efforts of the conference committee, led by Chairman Gingrich and Chairman Bachus, and the committee staff for their efforts. We are going to make major changes in this legislation. We will accomplish many things that both Democrats and Republicans agree are vitally important.  We are

reclaiming health government 

Final sequence: 

Reclaiming my time, I agree with the gentleman. Whatever you call this bill, on this side of the aisle we are all for it because the President of the United States and many other people on this side of the aisle support health care reform and believe that if government can't do it and somehow you run up more debt, we ought to just not run it. So we are all for it, but our priorities ought to be recognizing that reforming our health care system is what the American people want. Our priorities ought to be restoring priorities to our Nation's priorities reclaiming those priorities so that people can afford health care, and at the same time getting the job done.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues back to the Senate. I hope all of us can go on to working on the budget that is necessary for the United States and the Senate. I say thank you to all of our colleagues for their constituents' patience over the last 48 hours. They are seeing what has taken place in Washington, and they have seen a first of what we hope is a new new government--a better government--a government that will meet the needs of the American people.  So thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Final sequence: 

Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued its ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the most onerous anti-environment and labor laws on the books in the world that says that Boeing should pay no more than the industry actually asked for in its wages and benefits and that the decision must be reversed immediately.  In that ruling issued in May, the Office said that Boeing should have to pay workers the prevailing wages that were actually paid to them by Boeing in jobs that had been outsourced to foreign corporations. These workers were shipped overseas by Boeing--not to the United States but to other foreign-owned plants or factories. The order Boeing sends workers to foreign plants or factories is an advantage for those companies, which is to say that the workers get paid much less than they actually would if they were in the workplace. It is a cruel and
