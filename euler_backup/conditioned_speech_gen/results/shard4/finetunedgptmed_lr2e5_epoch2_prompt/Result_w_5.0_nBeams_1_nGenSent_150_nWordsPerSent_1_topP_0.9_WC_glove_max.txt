state ban alabama 

Final sequence: 

There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban in Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that Alabama could not ban this procedure in that state. I'm not a lawyer, but I can read it. This is an abortion procedure which involves throwing the baby into the uterus and then delivering the baby on the side of the head. So the 10th amendment does not ban this because it violates Roe v. Wade, but it simply says that we have no right to use any form of that amendment to limit the constitutional rights of women.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This is important work that has helped to ensure the success of the life science research we need in America.  We all have access to high quality science, but, for too long, we have not been able to produce the research and development that would expand the programs to ensure our progress in health care.  America currently spends roughly $2 trillion per year to do basic research in the biomedical sciences, one of the largest health care expenditures of any country in the world. Research on almost every aspect of human life and disease spans almost every field and is directly related to the health of all people, including cancer patients, Alzheimer's patients, and patients with heart disease and diabetes.

Mr. President, in addition, I would like to clarify the intentions of the Fund for the Future which now requires this temporary suspension of the capital gains tax deduction for a period of 9 months to allow the House to extend the extension to make the 2010 10-year rate permanent and to extend the 5-year time limit on the deduction to allow the House to enact the bill that will raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour in 2015. The Fund for the Future originally authorized this temporary extension to allow the House to enact the important legislation to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour over the next 3 years. I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Arizona to help clarify the intent of the Fund for the Future, and the fund intends to act on behalf of our constituents to bring forward a permanent change in the

And what we are going to do in the conference is we are going to do in some areas where we have other issues of concern and new areas that need to be addressed to make these important improvements in our Armed Forces, we are going to come back and pass those areas, and then we are going to go through conference on the bill and provide for a conference committee, and they are going to work together and then come back to us and

We hope that those who want to discuss this issue and will help those who are interested in this issue will work together to ensure that the Senate has a satisfactory outcome on the Glenn substitute. We are not going to go too long but I would like to get started with this and get to the issue as quickly as possible in order to get something to the Members of this body that will resolve the differences between the original amendment that Senator Glenn and I have offered and the Glenn substitute in terms of how much time is left to be allocated.

cbo millions loss 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, included in the Democrats' health plan are massive cuts to Medicare Advantage that would affect more than 25 million seniors in my congressional district and millions of other Americans.  Those cuts would increase health care costs for the average Medicare beneficiary and result in fewer benefits and fewer services for the majority of Medicare beneficiaries over the next decade.  This CBO report states that there are up to 12 million beneficiaries in this country who would lose their current plans in the year after 2010 and 16 million more over the following 10 years. Our choice is simple and very clear. We either defeat this plan or we improve it.  Democrats have the right plan to reform Medicare and address the Medicare problems facing the elderly. Our Democratic plan will save seniors money and help secure health care for the next generation of Americans.  When I go home, I tell seniors

I am pleased to bring to the House's attention that this important Senate resolution designates the week of August 10-18 as a National Idaho Three Cougar Week. Idaho has a long history as a three-cornered warrior family that has a proud heritage in the defense of the United States and a proud place in Idaho's history.

It increases the eligibility for Family and Medical Leave Act benefits and makes it easier for both women and men working for the government to obtain health coverage for their children and parents to make sure that they will be healthy for them through the fall and the winter months and for their own health needs. It is more than that it is a way to help to increase the earnings potential of working Americans who are struggling every day.

We put together a crisis response plan that involved the Department of Homeland Security, which is a little different from the Federal Protective Service and the police forces, but one that was extraordinarily important because it required interoperability.

For the next year, the Senate will not be meeting a single deadline for a budget to come to the floor for a vote. Rather, a Senate majority will continue to go through the motions of Government reform and even government spending in the short term to create the illusion that things are going well. That is not going to be the case for long and it will not be the case for the next 12 months.

Madam President, I announced this morning, though only Senator McConnell and I were on the floor, that this morning we will be beginning a 30-minute time period in morning business before the Senate will be voting on the motion to proceed to the Department of Defense appropriations bill for this year. I want to tell my colleagues that that 15 minutes this morning will be devoted to the debate on the motion to proceed. I do not know of any other Senators that would desire to participate in that debate. So that is the 15 minutes today and, if any Senator will want to speak prior to that, I think we could run it into the evening.  I will say at the appropriate time the Senate will be voting on a motion to proceed to the Department of Defense appropriations bill. I want to make it clear, though, that we will not

Madam President, George Washington once said of the Nation's flag, and I quote, ``Let us not cloud this subject with a more white flag of glory that never shall be used nor tarnished in the memory of our ancestors.'' We may be depending on that to Washington as he wrote the advice of our flag for the next few years.  In the months since that admonition was given to our flag, the so-called American Flag Protection Act has been added to the National Defense Authorization Act which was filed for us on the Senate floor this past week. I have written to the Senate on that particular matter several times over the past week, in an effort to get these issues resolved with this legislation before the time expires on the current supplemental which is available. In the same vein, the Senate voted to get the issues of the flag amendment in order

As we weaken those standards, as we have this wide-open trade arrangement with a country that is absolutely unregulated by any kind of regulations anywhere in the world, as we as Members of Congress are giving it the right to export goods all over the world to so many countries that are really not concerned about whether they are actually doing the right thing for their workers or whether they are doing the right thing for their environment or whether they are doing the right thing for the companies that own these companies, and as we have been selling products all over the world to those countries and we are giving the opportunity to sell products to those countries that we would like to have here in America, it creates an incentive for the jobs here in America, it creates an incentive for the success of our companies that provide employment to Americans.

The National Park Service has for a number of years failed to adequately secure any park visitors' property located in my congressional district. The decision was made in a hastily formed executive order of the President in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks to protect no park visitors' property at a park in Baltimore and not seek other Federal funding to do so. This new executive order reduced the Park Service's Secret Service staff and delayed the establishment of a new visitor center at the Big Sandy Motel and announced a new visitor

The term ``so help me God'' occurs before both the headings ``Social Security'' and ``Government contract authority,'' and it is simply a reference to the Endowment to Save and Restore a Medicare Benefit.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

And I know the Senator from Delaware has worked on this, and has offered a bill which would not only reduce the top rate but would provide those families with an earned income tax credit as a reward for work, rather than simply simply dropping it to 25 percent.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Buyer, Chairman Chabot, Chairman Miller, Mr. Reyes, and all of the members of the House Armed Services Committee for working together to complete this committee bill which does many of the things that our people were concerned with a few years ago with the new administration and many of the things they were concerned about on this committee which led us to the current continuing resolution that we are going to be faced with today. The majority and minority members of the Armed Services Committee have worked with us in an honorable and cooperative fashion throughout the course of the day to keep this bill in its current state and to complete it this way so we will not be faced with a lapse in military funding tomorrow morning.  One of the things that I wanted to bring to the attention of all of my colleagues is that this is really a short-term measure.

It is a fact that since we adopted this law back in 1994, the insurance industry has been making a furious push for more and more government control over health care and is much more focused than ever on trying to take control of this country through Federal regulation and government control over health care. Our job as legislators is to try to keep that government out of our lives and out of our healthcare decisions.

Mr. President, I have some comments. They will be short, but I will save them. It was interesting to see the President of the United States talk about campaign finance reform and the $1 billion in spending he talked about, and then I heard him on the Senate floor talk about an appropriation. If he wants to talk about an appropriation, then I would be willing to work with him on appropriations and ask him to do so, because we have been here before. I think it is one of the things that everyone here wanted to discuss in a bipartisan way and have worked out here on this floor and they will come back for more. I think there is a real understanding in the country that the Government should be smaller, and he has tried to turn a little bit of that on its head in the last week or two. I know

Madam President, I know there are others waiting to speak. I don't want to delay the proceedings and delay this situation further than necessary. I think all of us on both sides of the aisle are thinking the same thing. But I do want to continue the process of discussing the issue and trying to resolve it as quickly as possible. And the fact is that there are some problems with our amendment. This proposal could in fact resolve them and give these funds back to the American people who are asking for them. There are some problems with the amendment. I think the amendment ought to be rejected because of what we are trying to do to meet our concerns about the expenditure and funding for veterans health care. But I feel strongly about the need to go forward with this. We should move ahead with this and address some of the concerns that have been

Madam Speaker, I rise today out of deep concern about the budget that was passed this week by the Senate that will give enormous tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations and the very wealthiest among us. This budget is a clear example of how out of touch and out of touch this Congress is with what the American people want. In fact, we should not just call it a big money giveaway but that is what it is because it will give the largest increase in the value of the money that has been given to them since the Great Depression. This will increase the value of money that we will be able to pay today because the profits of these corporations, those who have gone out and bought political influence through their money in this country are going to rise at a rate of more than $800 billion a year.

Madam Chair, first, I would like to thank Congressmen Brown and Crist for an excellent amendment that was offered in the bill for the Central Valley Project. I would also like to thank the farmers and local residents for their help in getting this project approved back in 2006.  The Central Valley Project is an economic engine for the county of Stockton and Fresno County. It provides a reliable source of water for farmers in the western United States, but the need for this water has never been more urgent. After this project expires at the end of the year, it is estimated that it will take a year to pay the $46 million owed to the Federal Government.  My amendment would extend the Central Valley Project and pay this debt back to the Federal Government. We already have a history of not paying our bills in this manner, and so this

I was the only Member of this body to attend the commission hearing in Oklahoma City to receive the findings and conclusions of the American commission investigating the bombing and its meaning. I am confident that it is not about politics, but whether a political scapegoat is out to get President Clinton's pardon for a plot that never existed.  The commission's case and the facts surrounding the bombing not only proved that the primary motive of the bombing was Federal Government involvement, but that the bombing was the direct result of the Bill Clinton and Paula Jones investigations which sought the same, and to date have failed in that effort.

Mr. Speaker, watching Bill and Hillary explain their finances reminds me of an old Steve Martin song from the 1990s about Ayn Rand. It makes for good television, but I have to say the rules of the Ethics Committee ought to be being relaxed in the area of tax shelters.  I'm going to suggest this is not really tax shelters for taxpayers at all. The bill before the House now provides for real estate transactions not tax shelters. Even the mortgage industry has come to its senses.  In order to get access to real estate funds in the real estate market, a very recent measure has been enacted that requires a health plan to establish a tax shelter for the account that serves as the tax shelter and deducts income from the fund. In the case of a home equity finance company, a health insurance company, that's the

As I said to the Senator from Pennsylvania, there is no need for this. The underlying measure in the House is not at all a cut of any kind in the sense of more than $15 million from the Advanced Technology Program. What the Senator is saying is that when we look at the other end of the spectrum where we have increased expenditures over the years for a lot of these, not a one dollar increase, and I would hope we will not end up with more cuts in the Science Program than we did in the Education Program, then there is no need to proceed on this at all because we have all gone through the bill in the past several weeks.

This bill will cost more than ever before because of overregulation and tax cuts for the wealthy; overregulation and tax cuts for the tobacco companies that kill so many people in this country; and overregulation and tax cuts for corporate welfare. The bill is a tax hike for middle class and working families that will raise taxes on nearly every American by $1,000 next year on the issue of cigarette taxes and a tax increase on those that sell prescription drugs for the Nation's seniors and people with disabilities.

Mr. President, anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. Constitution knows that no President can spend a dime of Federal tax money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by Congress--both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.  So when you hear a politician or an editor or a commentator declare that ``Reagan ran up the Federal debt'' or that ``Bush ran it up,'' bear in mind that it was not President Reagan or Vice President Bush who ran it up, it was Congress that did it. It was the will of the American people that Congress control the spending of their hard-earned tax money. It is the people's House. And it is the people's debt that has kept us in this sorry state of affairs for the last 8 years.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.

As I said, at the outset, I was somewhat skeptical of the Department of Education's lack of a robust increase in higher education funds for the next several years. One reason I said this was the Department was hesitant to increase its funding for higher education for a variety of reasons, including the high cost

The purpose of the hearing is to receive testimony on the President's fiscal year 2009 budget for the Department of the Interior, and the effects that it will have on the energy industry and the domestic energy sector.  Because of the limited time available for the hearing, witnesses may testify by invitation only. However, those wishing to submit written testimony for the hearing record should send two copies of their testimony to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, Washington, DC 20510-6150.

Madam President, I rise today to offer this amendment because I am concerned about the price of crude oil and the associated price increase for American consumers as they pay the high prices at the pump today. This price increase is being driven by the escalation of the gasoline price as well as the increase in the cost of crude oil as a result of the price of crude oil. This has put an increased price burden on American consumers and many oil companies that have to cut prices for consumers as well as increase profits for those that continue to drill in the Gulf of Mexico and other areas of the country. In addition to high gasoline prices for American consumers and those who are struggling to pay for gasoline as a result of high gas prices, the increased oil costs for companies that are drilling in the gulf this summer has also significantly reduced the supply of oil that

I do not know of any way to make it better without meeting some very difficult demands of the President of the United States of America who wants to send troops. But we have to give the President the benefit of the doubt in terms of the contents of this bill that is now before us because of the President's great concern for human rights.

We need to make it our top priority in Congress to fund more funding for natural resources restoration, to protect our national parks and forests, to save and provide wildlife habitat and all the other priorities that we see as important in a healthy nation.  The conference report before us does just that. Every dollar that we put in our lands and our water are some of the best spent dollars in this country. In fact, the proposal includes nearly a trillion dollars over a 5-year period, a year before funding increases.  The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the national parks

The question is not whether we are going to accept the Republican budget resolution that says we are going to spend $900 million more than $700 million, the Republican budget resolution that says we are going to spend $700 million more than $850 million, or the Democratic budget resolution which spends $900 million more than $1 billion more than that.

The primary reason that this bill has been so successful is because it will be driven by a law that makes good on a promise we made to our children last year to those of us who have the responsibility of providing them with a place for free and public education so that they will not be subject to violent sexual abuse in their own homes. The easy answer to this is that there has to be a better way for kids to be able to view this kind of material than the tradition of pornography that has become our national pastime. But the very fact that it is more prevalent in this country than in the rest of the world shows that the need for strong Federal protection is the absolute and very necessary

We are not being used to show off our political history or our political agenda to turn this question in this Congress in a partisan way that would not be acceptable to this body or the American people.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, while the United States and Russia are friends and allies in many ways and are good friends and allies in the Middle East, it is not only the safety of Americans that is threatened by this crisis in Russia. We in this Congress have taken steps to seek the benefit of cooperation with the Russians to end the crisis in our two countries. We have worked to continue to work with them to prevent the ongoing conflict between the Russian Federation and its neighbors and support the diplomatic efforts of the Russians to bring peace to the region. And we have acted to pull the United States out of the Middle East because of the recent conflict in the Middle East and in Iraq, which brought the fighting between Iraq and its neighbors into

Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Nickles, and his staff and I thank my colleague Senator Levin for what he said earlier on, because we have heard a lot about confirmation hearings and how difficult it is. There was some discussion last week about how the Senator from Oklahoma wants to avoid the Judiciary Committee, because Senators shouldn't be rushing the nomination--that is one of the criticisms. I think he is being fair. I don't understand how he is saying, ``We don't want to have a hearing, except it is for our own political gain. We don't want hearings.'' I don't think that is fair.  The bill before us today, when we have more nominees, frankly, it is better to have a good Senator on the floor and then a good number of votes. The Senators who are nominated, as

Mr. Chairman, this amendment lowers the appropriation in the Army National Guard portion of the bill to the level of the request of the House earlier in this bill, which is $2.7 million below the bill's total request of $4.1 million and the request from the administration for fiscal year 2008. As such, I support the amendment. I do, however, want to make a couple of points in response to the gentleman from Ohio who just talked about funds in the Department of the Army for the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard for Iraq and Afghanistan.  First, we have requested $8.5 million more than the administration was asking for for the Army Reserve programs as authorized under the supplemental continuing resolution. I understand there is a challenge in trying to take out additional funding for the National Guard, but we have actually

This measure does much for housing and the issues we deal with, that is, the stimulus package that took effect, but it does not do enough to go on to other parts of the housing problem that the President and the Democrats have taken up as part of their war on terror policy of the past year and a half and a half that will bring home to those people they have been trying to break away from their homes so

I have long been a strong supporter of programs that help both local and Federal Government develop important systems and infrastructure improvements. But as Chairman Young pointed out, this bill takes critical steps to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil. The bill includes funds to restore funding for the Interior Department's Senior Water and Power Strategic Plan, supports project-based contracts for demonstration projects to establish new and innovative systems and structures, and improves our Nation's preparedness and resilience against natural disasters.  This bill is particularly timely given the country's current and projected energy crisis.

The Republican majority did not come to this Congress of America with any plan of reform or any understanding of what was good or bad about the Medicare system in America. It came to this Congress to repeal a law that was passed in 1965 to protect senior citizens from a dishonest system of financing which allowed the entitlement to grow out of control and allow Federal Government to contract with private health insurance companies. The Republican majority in this Congress and the last Congress repealed Medicare as we knew it, the law that had kept this Nation from going broke and to protect Americans from a possible Federal Government takeover of health care.

All of the economic transactions that take place in this country today are about government regulation and that is something that we are all for, but not all of the businesses are.  There is a very important group of businesses that pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those that do not pay any taxes at all, and they are a rather tiny percentage of business that we think of as individuals or businesses, or at least the owners of them and the employees and other people that support them in that.

budget roughly fund 

Final sequence: 

I would like to point out it is not only education where we are looking for money and getting people to the classroom that we are eliminating funds for. This budget is $14 billion below where we were 2 years ago. So it is not only education dollars we are cutting, it is the whole equation.  We need to be cutting dollars from small businesses. We need to be cutting dollars from education dollars so they can grow and hire more people so they can build homes and start businesses. That is the only way we are going to make this country and its future work more effectively. The least we can do is to take the next 10 months and do that.   amulet money mr. number 2043  perceptions per capita of income of all Americans per million people  Congressional Budget Office (March 1, 1998)

The Quality Assurance Act would allow States to achieve the program's goals without placing significant risk to public health or the environment. It would provide States the flexibility to be fair and transparent with regard to appropriate licensing rules and regulations. It would allow States to make timely decisions about safe and adequate standards for the dangerous chemicals, provide States more options for developing monitoring and education materials to help them better assess health risks, and allow States the flexibility to be more responsive to changes in the chemical supply chain to improve the public health and protect public health and the environment.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great arguments that I have heard in this debate about Medicare has been that it is a government-run program that should be more closely held by the American people than a private insurance company that would provide a private program of care to the seniors of this country. I think it is a reasonable argument and it is one that I have always found very appealing. I do not think it is appropriate to try to mandate Medicare on the American people and to say that they do not have a choice of what kind of Medicare they can have or to try to force them to buy the best Medicare plan possible when that does not work for them. It just does not make sense.  The goal of this debate is to make it more like the government program and the private program in this country where the government is just working

I do not know that I have ever heard any one person who has been a real leader in the Committee on the Budget on this issue come up to me and say that we have cut $3.5 billion in the Pentagon budget without first having the committee and the subcommittee take a look at it before we do that. That is a very far cry from having the committee and the subcommittee take a look at it before we even go out and do it. If they do not think it is a good idea, that is a great way to show it in this House when we say we are not going to spend that much money in the appropriations of the Federal Government without first having a great deal of time and the hearing in the Committee on Appropriations before we do it.

In a similar vein, my amendment prohibits using funds under the bill to assist the development of new natural gas infrastructure that is aboveground. As these two amendments are the product of private-sector energy companies that are not subject to the competitive bidding process that is used under current law, it is not the intent of the committee to be making this change. As the Department has indicated on numerous occasions, it does not have the power to issue the authorizations that allow this company to establish new facilities aboveground on the Outer Continental Shelf and for use as a test site for new natural gas technologies.

But is it not the case that this bill would go far beyond any cost savings that we would want to bring about? We all know how damaging sequestration is to the safety of the Nation's ports and our environment. I believe that reducing the amount of funding that will be used in ports and for our transportation needs will have an enormously positive impact on both our air travel capacity and our economy, so I do not see any particular disagreement about this at all.   combination

Now, in the last year of the Clinton administration, the impeachment inquiry was held in the committee which was at one point chaired by Speaker Gingrich, but Speaker Gingrich's impeachment inquiry was held in the same committee that we were considering a Presidential impeachment of President Bush. So this spectacle, like most proceedings in this House, involves a minority Member, it involves Members who are determined that their point of view is viewed as serious enough to be aired in this Congress, and then they sit at the Democratic table with the majority's opponents and they discuss their case.  This really goes to the heart of the House debate, and it certainly illustrates a very clear gap between the leadership of the Democratic Party and the process of congressional inquiry, a gap that really is the hallmark of

These funds are available for the purpose of hiring more employees at the border patrol and Customs and Border Protection agencies and for other purposes in an effort to make the country work in the short term.

Mr. Speaker, this motion is a simple bill that will allow for a ban on the first round of regulations issued under the President's so-called energy plan. Specifically, the rule would ban all new regulations after the first round of new regulations are issued and before the new rules expire unless the Congress comes to the Congress and agrees to the extension of the prior moratorium that the administration has proposed. The bill before the House today allows for the consideration of one energy plan only, which is the one we are debating now that the House last considered in January.  It has taken us quite some time to finally take on the challenge of continuing this unnecessary regulatory process. In fact, this House voted to extend the moratorium last year only to find that it was not needed by February. Now

We will see what happens after we get an opportunity to try to get some additional time to try to work this out. But I wish the Senator from New Mexico well with his comments and hope that he does not disappoint Senator Dole in the next

Mr. Chairman, we are in the midst of a great debate today about how we spend our limited government resources. Some have proposed what amounts to the Social Security trust fund be used to provide health insurance to all of America's seniors and their children. We have gone through this debate in the past and know how it would have generated enormous personal and economic problems for our country and all of our fellow Americans. I have some of my colleagues here to urge us not to proceed further and to realize that we cannot take our hand out and take our country and our family into our hands and use this trust fund to provide our children with health care if we know how it would result in untold problems for our Nation and

A strong majority of Americans do not believe that the government should be able to use Federal agencies and other Federal programs as a pay-to-play play for illegal and illegal activities that are taking place on our border and throughout this country right now. Many Americans want us to come together as a country and stop this kind of hypocrisy and to end this particular kind of behavior that is going on in this country right now.  So I believe that we are going to be able to come together and we are going to get this right here in the people's House, and that is what the American people are asking us to do.

Our Nation must have a comprehensive national policy in order to protect the lives of its citizens and its resources and to deter other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction of a similar capability. I believe the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey is one such policy that can and should be implemented. It is one that is based on the 21st century in which nuclear weapons have become part of the cultural and the political discourse and of the information and communications that have made us the world's most powerful Nation and our most vulnerable nation.

It is not available to all Americans under the $500-per-child tax credit or under the $15,000-per-child tax credit or under the $250-per-child child tax credit. So we are spending more money than the Senate says we are going to spend to support the tax on those who do not pay taxes as a tax and by the same token we are spending more money than we are spending in this bill to help those who pay taxes and pay into that system as a tax by paying in.

It is just not good common sense to do that.   zombiefly By whatever term one wishes to use, I want to make the point at one point in the vote we had that on the other side had stood for sitting in judgment. It meant that they would accept the suggestion that my son and my brother have submitted to present to the committee, that if they could not prove in court they were victims, they would be granted immunity, and my amendment takes that away.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I strongly urge Members to support the Lewis amendment, and to oppose the motion to strike.  Adapter:  The good news is that a Republican commission is now off the table if the majority does not allow this amendment to come to the floor. A Republican commission would have had enough credibility among Members of Congress to be bipartisan and would have allowed Members to weigh in as they see fit in a free and fair legislative process that was held up by this Congress and House leadership for far

The United States was a slave to Pakistan in the 1990s and now is a free and independent country with borders to Pakistan that are not even remotely as secure as those they occupied in the 1950s and 1960s. The United States and the United Nations should lead the fight against the horrible war crimes against the civilian population of Pakistan and should demand from the Pakistani Government to live up to their commitments to end the genocide that took the lives of some 1,600 innocent civilian Pakistani people by 1996 and continues to this

The Democratic Tax Reduction Act of 1997 will do that and that is the only reason the Senate has allowed it to take effect, not to give a break to the rich. That is the only reason the Senate has allowed that bill to come to the floor today to allow these tax cuts to become even more generous for those earning over $100,000 a year in America. I think the President can now see that the American people are willing to take even more of the tax cuts under this plan than they ever were before and that is the way the Senate will continue to operate.

Abbott to the Chair.   helicopters now come in when the mission is less important than the money for it. It is so very important we get this war right and we do it this way.

Mr. Speaker, I am proud that I voted for the coalition budget. The coalition budget is balanced, Medicare reform is in place, tax cuts for all Americans are in place, and so I stand here to support the coalition budget and for tax cuts.  Mr. Speaker, I am not one who believes that budget cuts should be targeted on their victims. That means that Medicare and Medicaid funding should be increased, and I am glad that the Republican budget, which will cut Medicaid by $270 billion, has a budget that provides funding for Medicare and Medicaid in an increase over the Republican budget which cuts it significantly, by $270 billion. But when the budget that is proposed cuts programs in Medicare by $270 billion and cuts tax cuts for all Americans $270 billion, I think that is really wrong.  That is the budget that Medicare

So I would say to the Senator from Ohio that he has really been much more on the side of the program than the idea that this bill is about to be passed without his vote in the Senate or without the Presidential approval and without his participation in this debate. So I hope that his cooperation would be a most welcome experience for all of us in the years to come because he has been the unquestioned leader in terms of fighting for the 10 years and has shown

Mr. Speaker, while many are quick to criticize the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the so-called stimulus act of 2009, because it included $20 billion to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands in order to pay for corporate welfare and social spending, that is not the truth. It is important to note that the bill added some new programs that will have an immediate impact on the people of this country. For example, the money goes to the 727 Federal bridge that serves some of the largest highways in the country. This new bridge is at a place called Westport which has a number of places where the war on drugs and the so-called war on terror has not yet been accomplished because the American people have not yet made up their minds to take care of our country and our infrastructure needs when the time comes for them to make those

Since 1992 the number of employees at the State Department's Department of the Inspectors General for Management and Pay has increased by almost 70 percent in that same time period, so the increase in the number of employees on the State Department payroll has been modest at best. Even the small increase in the total amount of funding from $16 million to $40 million which we offered in this bill does not reflect an increase in employee salaries or costs that would be necessary to provide the necessary staffing to carry out the tasks of the Inspectors General in the manner which we have recommended in this legislation.

I am a strong supporter of the work of the new civilian acquisition organizations and I appreciate them making this change and developing new business models to obtain contracts for things that are now, or have been in the past, offered by the Department of Defense.  But this amendment simply makes a technical correction to the defense procurement system to better recognize the need to have two separate systems that the President can sign off on and that the Congress can check and approve, without having to go

It would remove the need for the FBI to be directly involved in counterintelligence operations in the interior of our Nation.  Unfortunately, the question is how. Why does the Congress stand by and allow foreign agents to recruit, spy, or infiltrate our security forces and now use our law enforcement personnel as spying tools? Why does the Congress allow the President to secretly use military forces and resources as agents of justice when we have one in Congress who has just as much right to hold any executive branch official accountable for criminal or foreign policy wrongdoing that has occurred

She served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1982 until 1992. In addition, she served for two terms in the California State Assembly before being elected to Congress in 1994 as a co-chairman of the Los Angeles Public Utility District and later was elected mayor. In office Barbara always had the good sense to take care of her constituents and on the issue of the Outer Sunset that was of great concern to the entire county. Barbara served in the Santa Clarita

The first legislation would extend critical oil security inspections to critical oil pipeline lines that transport hazardous liquids, such as crude oil and natural gas. As our Nation continues to be faced with an unprecedented number of terrorist attacks and other kinds of harm to our national security and our way of life, we need to make sure that we have a comprehensive and effective system for ensuring that our nation's critical national energy infrastructure is secure and the necessary security measures are in place. The second legislation would require the Department of Defense to provide to the committee the cost of a site visit of all Department of Defense installations as well as the total cost of all phases of the Homeland Security Advanced Transportation Technology Program and the Global Security Technology Program.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of Northern Kentucky University in George and Grace Hill State Park.  Located in the city of George and Grace, the Northern Kentucky University campus was named for President Theodore Roosevelt, who wanted to preserve his ``western vision of public education as a central part of America's national effort to restore our national commitment to public education.'' The campus is more than just a place of learning for students and faculty. It is a place of great history and public service to the University community. Since its founding in the spring of 1874, Northern Kentucky University has been a world-class educational institution serving the students of the University of Kentucky and Kentucky as a whole. Students enrolled at Northern Kentucky University as freshmen have received graduate degrees from 12 of Kentucky's top universities. Along with more than

For the last 20 years, the politics of fear has dictated how and when Congress should deal with the budget, only to ensure that when budgets are produced and the economy is booming, Congress will again resort to political games and spend at the behest of special interests.  If President Bush's record as a war criminal and the fact that he has vetoed more budget items since being sworn in was not enough to cause a Federal official to alter his mind, the GOP has taken matters into its own hands.

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system which penalizes self-reliance in the individual and discourages self-reliance in the family would have serious and perhaps destructive consequences on States like Maine and New Hampshire. Roosevelt believed that welfare reform that rewards illegitimacy or work and encourages work was ineffective, ineffective, ineffective. While family structure and children's education are improvements, having more children of one's own is not.  As the family values movement has grown in our country, so has the history of America's welfare system. The welfare reform movement has become something of an anti-family political football because the program calls for more work in the long run, but most children have no real choice in the matter. And I can tell you that most parents are looking for the best

Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for his input and, like him, I support this process that is working here to get us to the goal of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States and to the point where we can give to the American people their first glimpse of what it might look like if we did that. And I think this is something that we need to do today to give them that first glimpse of the type of fiscal discipline that is in this country and what the real-world impacts of that will be for our Nation as a whole as we move forward to give them that first look and make them really understand the discipline in this House and in this House leadership which is leading this country and giving us this opportunity to pass a balanced budget amendment that we cannot get from here to there unless we give this

It does not apply to any member of the body after that date.  The only second-degree amendments permitted to be offered on appropriations measures or a motion to recommit under clause 2 of rule XXI is the modification which declares the pending amendment as expired, which has already been done for over 120 days in the past, and the one to which the gentleman from Missouri just referred is not even before the House right now.

The problem is one that we all believe we are in and, more importantly, one that exists and which ought to be dealt with in an honest and effective way so that we do not continue to be in the situation that we are in today and in any future years when our trade laws prevent us from pursuing a fair trade policy and when our economic policies cause us to trade in a way that costs our citizens too much and in the wrong way for a number of reasons.  Now this is not to suggest that we should continue to ignore this law, but the way this amendment is worded and the way this amendment will be enforced is not a good way to provide a solution for this issue without dealing with the concerns that the chairman

I want to further talk to the Chair about the issue of congressional oversight of agencies that are charged with the responsibility of improving public health and ensuring that public health and the public welfare are not compromised. One area of Federal Government that is not up to the same high standards that should be the top priority of any Member in the House is the Food and Drug Administration.  The problems that we have with this agency under FDA are many, including the inadequacies in the agency's existing infrastructure, problems with its oversight over its jurisdiction, lack of oversight of its actual activities. I think it is very important that we understand exactly why we need congressional oversight of this agency.  The reason we need oversight is to make sure that the Federal Government functions in the same

Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the majority leadership for bringing this bill, S. 2, to the floor for the first time. Over the last 2 years, I have come to the floor almost every day to highlight the extraordinary achievements and pressing challenges facing the Nation as we prepare to debate and vote on the budget for fiscal year 2002. These are the kinds of priorities that the Congress should be focusing on in the spring of this year. The Congressional Budget Office has forecast that the cost of President Clinton's fiscal plan for the next year will be $19 trillion. The alternative has a comprehensive plan that eliminates or in some cases substantially reduces the deficit in the next 7 years by over $1 trillion. While President Clinton's proposals have been criticized for failing to address one of his main proposals to reduce the deficit, what I would like to address is

Is it not true that this administration has pursued their own agenda in the public interest, in fact, and has essentially been a special interest like no other in the history of this country?

I have said all along that I think the primary role of Congress in addressing the housing crisis is in the Congress of the United States and not in the Congress of the State of Alabama. The Federal Government can and must do more to help the African American community, but we also need to do more in the States, especially in the rural areas where the housing crisis is greatest, to understand that the Federal Government should not be on the front line in trying to bring about housing reform in our country.

Our country will suffer.  Democrats are standing up and demanding accountability from the majority and Republicans are paying for it. The American taxpayers deserve better. And we don't need another Government shutdown.  For these reasons and many more, I am offering legislation to bring about a cease-fire between the Government and the American people. It is a very simple, straightforward piece of legislation that simply says when the government must reopen to fund the activities of the Federal Government, it should reopen.  It should reopen on Monday at the earliest. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

There are some troubling signs that the lack of preparedness in public schools is worse than most of us are aware. Earlier this week there were reports that a school in the city of New London in my State had not been built in a year and a half. This is the second school to be built under the so-called Local Improvement Program, which has left some school districts with less resources than they could possibly supply. Today in Connecticut, school districts across the State are planning for the worst. The State's school superintendent has announced that Connecticut's schools may be facing shutdowns if nothing is done soon to improve funding for the program. Since Connecticut was selected for the program in the first place, many school districts

However, in 1986, with a small donation from the President, the General Accounting Office [GAO] was able to report that they were proceeding with a program of confidential and cooperative information exchange between the Government of the United States and the Soviet Union to

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the passing of Chicago Police Commander Paul Bauer, who was a leader in Chicago and across the country in the fight against violence. On January 30, 2010, Paul was shot and killed in the line of duty in the city of Cook County while responding to a burglary call. Officer Bauer had just completed the third burglary in his 7 years in the police force.  Paul was very much a family man, and family is at the heart of all of my relationships. My father and my mother worked together in business, and my brother and sister-in-law in the U.S. Navy.  The people of Illinois lost a man who embodied the love of duty, and I join in mourning his loss.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

When I was the Democratic leader, I came up with a unique vision for America, that the problem we have with providing health care for all of America is that health care is too expensive. And with Senator Brownback as my Health Advisor, I brought health care to all families in America. I now see that we are a nation of health care delivery systems. And when

We all know the importance of ensuring veterans receive the highest quality of health care. This is a decision that both sides of the aisle agree to, but in the recent decade we have witnessed some tragic events occur, in which the health care of our veterans has been threatened or had to be thrown away by the agencies of government that have been tasked with the care of our veterans.

I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Vermont on this issue, but I want to be clear that what the Senate is asking for this evening is a vote on the subject of student loan interest subsidies that is supported by this Senate in the belief that it is the right thing to do for America and will not in any way limit the ability of this institution to get its work done or make it harder for students to get access to education in this country.

It is an amendment that simply states that the Congress has decided that the question before the House is whether Congress has the will and the will of the American people to pass legislation to stop the illegal immigration problem in this country. I think that is what the American people want us to do and that is what this legislation does. It says: ``As Congress has determined that the Senate has not yet passed legislation to control the illegal immigration problem in this country by enacting legislation in a comprehensive way to deal with the issue of illegal immigration, Congress has therefore determined that Congress will give the President the authority to take such legislation to the States for enactment.'' So the bill says what the administration has decided to do and the State of California has decided to do. But

Madam President, I simply want to take a moment to say a few words about a very important issue. The issue I bring up is one that is about the future of our country and of our future in this country and in this world. I think it is an issue we need to address in terms of energy policy, and it is an issue that all of us should be working together on.  What I would like to do is to take just a few minutes to talk about some of the problems that we face in the United States and in other countries as a result of the President's broken promises on the issue of energy and the problems that are at the very top of his list and the kind of pain he has caused our country in this country and in other countries where we find the country without a way to pay for its

There were no hearings or anything going on because we did not want the people to know about what was in this bill before it came out and everyone had time to work out the differences in this bill and come back to the people and say to them and to their constituents back home about the good things that have been done and what should be done with the tax cuts

This would be a blue slip for a judicial nomination that had no more than one Republican vote in the last Congress, even though there were about one-third of those who were against it then.

minimum raising percent 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, last week 20 House Republicans introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour in Washington State and raise the minimum wage by 10 cents over 4 years. Since the Democrats were in the majority in the House, the minimum wage has fallen from $4.25 in the middle of the 1980s to $3.15 today and it has barely increased in value since the mid-1990s. It is much more than a minimum wage increase.  In a nation that is becoming increasingly competitive for low-wage jobs and increased travel costs, this tax increase could cost Americans nearly $100 billion a year for the next decade alone as more and more workers will be left out of the work force while their wages are increased more than 20 percent.

Mr. President, I certainly concur with my friend from Vermont. We hope to finish this bill as soon as possible this week. I think the other amendments have been cleared on both sides of the aisle and have been accepted and would go on as the managers will have them before they go to the other side of the aisle. We are having an all-day session this week. The issue of the vote and the number of Senators to attend the committee hearing, as we have worked on that, is up to the managers. So, that will take some time and probably deal with other amendments this afternoon.  So, Mr. President, with respect to this legislation, we should have final votes at the appropriate time. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his support. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The  utilized

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Secretary of Education branded the 2.7 million teacher-strong National Education Association as the most anti-education group in America. They want the public school to fail, the public education to fail. And yet this Congress has passed a bill to replace the Secretary with the respected chairman of the Education Subcommittee, Alan Dershowitz of the Southern Baptist Convention. But what the administration doesn't tell you is that if we had voted on this in the House yesterday, the committee would not have had a chance to offer its recommendation for the administration to write on the new Secretary. The same people that want to give a head start to the international corporations will not have a chance to help with the political school. The same people that want to provide tax cuts for the wealthy will not have a chance to help with what the media wants to

Patrick and I were both elected to the Senate in the same election in 1992 and have enjoyed working together in a number of positions as Senators and as Senators in the past.

Mr. President, 14 years ago, Congress made a grave mistake. In the dead of night, Congress decided to authorize and the administration had to start giving up the ghost and take up the bill to put people back to work while we spent time working out how to pay for it.  For 18 months, the White House fought every step of the way. The goal was to raise the debt ceiling in order to get the financial markets back in work. What we did not have time for is to deal with the debt, interest payments on the debt, interest payments on the Treasury's bonds, and the credit cards and the taxes on that debt. The money they raised from those other markets, borrowing to pay for things that Congress never considered, could not even pay interest.  It would be as if we had taken up the issue of Medicare and

I support the amendment because it is important that people have a tax that is actually like a check that is actually sent to them that they can send it back to Washington and not have that money used for anything other than to raise taxes or make the government worse. What we have done here today, Mr. Chair, is to make a bad situation worse by increasing the tax that Americans send to Washington that they do not have to pay back to the Federal Government because it is simply not enough.

His announcement that there would be an increase in rates in the near future is a threat to economic stability in our economy and to interest rates throughout the world. There has been increased volatility in this global economy as countries face the upsurge in inflation due to increased exports and burgeoning consumer demand.  These developments, coupled with unprecedented U.S. economic growth, has resulted in a shortage of credit and low unemployment. The economy is growing, creating jobs and boosting productivity. But our economy remains, in fact, fragile.  It is my belief that our economy is in significant disarray. The prior President's economic policies--policy that contributed to high unemployment and low growth for too long--have continued

We all should not fall victim to fear mongering, not this time. Consumers, their doctors, their insurance companies, and the administration support the caps. This is a negotiation between the private sector and the Federal Government that continues to lead us to an improved health care system. We should not go through this again.

Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss of U.S. Army SSG William J. Sarbast of Knox, NH, who died on April 15, 2003, after a battle with smallpox at Fort Detrick in Fort Carson, CO.  William served with the 82d airborne division in South Korea and was assigned to Fort Ord. Colonel Sarbast was a product of George Post's Littleton High School in Knox.  A general officer for the Marine Corps Reserve in the Army, Colonel Sarbast was wounded during a tactical combat operation in October 1991 in North Vietnam. Colonel Sarbast served as the battalion commander for the Marine Corps Reserve Force Forces Association and served with the Sixth Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment, 26th Marine Regiment in the 101st Airborne Division in Europe.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3153 and H.R. 2988, the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act of 2003. This bill will improve the health care services available to our Nation's veterans and allow them to remain on the battlefield and continue their service to our Nation.  The financial assistance this legislation provides to our Nation's veterans will allow them to continue to work with military authorities to provide services in every one of the VA medical facilities that they currently rely on for care and maintenance. This will help ensure that they are not excluded from our country's medical system and will allow them the ability to receive timely health care services from our Nation's veterans while in service to our country.  Madam Speaker, this legislation is of critical importance to our Nation's veterans because the quality of their care will be enhanced by providing better access to

We have agreed with the Senator from Alaska, we did accept his proposal, and he will be moving to put it in his bill. It is an important one.

If it has an impact on the budget process of the Congress of the United States and the President, it ought to be brought up for consideration.

I have already spoken about the government of Iraq with respect to the number of Iraqis who have fled their country and are now seeking refuge in the United States and other countries because of our great number of Iraqi citizens and foreign nationals that have not returned home and those who have fled from Iraq and who are facing enormous hardships in many of their own countries, including in the Islamic Republic of Iran and Lebanon.

There are reasons to be concerned about the potential for shutdown of the Federal Government if Congress does not come together and get the job done. But there is no problem because the budget and the budget agreement before the House could not be handled and would not survive this session. There is a reason to be concerned that the House of Representatives will not come together in time to reopen the Federal Government or give to the President the agreement he has made that the people of the United States should be kept on the payroll through October 7 of this year.

While I do not support every provision in the bill before us today, I will support this important bill because it contains several provisions which I believe will help small businesses and small Government agency employees in Tennessee and throughout the Nation to be able to pursue their business plans more efficiently and effectively without the need for unnecessary additional Federal regulations and regulations for which there is no clear purpose or requirement

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. First of all, let us do that right at the outset to get the record straight as to what this amendment is about. It does not change existing law or affect existing contracts for new defense contracts. It simply sets up a more open process.  If a contract was awarded in 1995 for $23 million and accepted as a new contract in 2006 it will have to go through the appropriations process. But if it is a contract that has already been awarded and has to be bid out under this bill, it will have to go through the regular procurement process. And once the administration requests the procurement dollars for a specific purpose for some reason, that request would not be allowed under this bill.

Well, I thank my friend. And I too want to just extend our appreciation for all of the work that you and the members of the committee have done to make sure that we are still funding all of the Department of Energy's priorities. But it is very clear to me that all of these people that are talking about this simply never knew about the promises that we made, the commitment that we made to the American people that there was $10 billion in spending that we were going to reduce by at least 20 percent in the budget of the Department of Energy.  So when I hear the supporters of this amendment say that it is only a 10 percent cut, but it is going to increase our imports, that it is going to increase our imports and cost jobs; they need to know that we are making progress in reducing these Department of

Madam President, the war in Iraq is the greatest challenge facing our country. Unfortunately, the response of the U.S. Senate has been a complete failure. Let me be clear: We have not yet achieved victory in Iraq and have not yet won the war on terrorism. But we have some things to be proud of today and tomorrow and today and tomorrow. And we have some things to say about Iraq that are positive for us and that will strengthen our country long into the future. So today I wish to outline three big problems our country must have and correct what needs to be fixed in Iraq. I am concerned that the Congress has failed to achieve even the initial goal of getting our troops out of Iraq by the end of 2006.  The war in Iraq has cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and billions more will likely be spent to

Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion and debate today about the Indian Education Act and the provision of the legislation regarding what the Senate is considering today. The debate has been so heavy on the amendments that are related to the bill, the underlying legislation, that we have been unable to address all the substantive questions of the legislation.  As I understand it, there is a very short time available to address the issues relating to the Indian education provisions in the legislation. There will be a vote on the confirmation of Judge Michael Sanzenbacher as a United States District Court judge in Oklahoma, the day after, not the next day.

Mr. Speaker, my friend from New York claims this is not political. Forty-five minutes ago he said the President of the United States and Republican Members of the House are not bringing to this House the majority to fund the government this year. In fact, it was the Speaker who earlier this week said this House is engaged in a political battle, and the President is engaged in a political battle as well. The President said this House will not have the opportunity to vote on his bill to repeal the gas tax without Democrats being here to call for a vote, and he said it just as the House did yesterday when they voted on that bill.  He said today that the Republican leader himself has made a political statement by threatening to not allow any debate, which is a statement that the President is now making in his own office, but he also said

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1775, the Democratic Act, which would extend the work authorization for the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, through September 30, 2013.  There is no question that the 2014 Federal Government shutdown forced the Department to divert resources away from vital functions to protect Federal employees, provide treatment to unemployed workers, and protect the citizens of the United States.  My goal with the Democratic Act is to bring that crisis to an end.   blew away for a good chunk of the spring. Everyone in this room has been traumatized by the despicable actions of the Republicans who broke our civil rights laws, attacked Planned Parenthood, and did the unthinkable in a matter of hours.

Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the future, which will affect our ability to export commodities to our strategic markets like Europe and Asia and serve our own national security interests. The administration has stated that our policy should be updated as soon as possible.  The FY 2000 bill was approved in October 1993. But unfortunately, the House Appropriations Committee has not yet approved a budget request for fiscal year 1998, and as chairman of the Subcommittee on Agricultural and Foreign Affairs, I am troubled by the lack of leadership on this subject.  On October 26, the House voted overwhelmingly to approve a $25 million in funding for the Congressional Research Service to conduct a study on our foreign agricultural policy. Speaker Gingrich was particularly supportive of this request. While I voted against the committee's request, I remain deeply concerned that

Whatever you call this bill, on this issue the President has already taken a huge step that we need to make a move in that direction because this is a crisis not just in our health care system but in the economy and it is our national debt that is the problem here as well as the Government.  What we are doing with our side of the aisle in the Finance Committee--and I do not agree with many of the things they are doing--we are doing a historic oversight of the entitlement programs that are paying some of our bill today--such as Medicare and Medicaid and the earned income tax credit, all of which will be completely reformed and completely reformed in this year, next year and next year.

Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued its ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the agencies, the Office of Personnel Management. As part of that action, Boeing filed an action against the Office of Personnel Management to enforce the terms of a temporary reemployment provision that would allow it to maintain its headquarters at its former site while it is allowed to relocate to an overseas base. Boeing intends to defend its case, arguing that the permanent facility at its Seattle headquarters should be excluded from the reemployment benefit which it has been given since 1986. It is clear that the office should be allowed to move on its own without these very reasons because this decision does not have a significant impact on other agencies. It simply places Boeing at an out of federal Government agency's legal standing in the process of providing benefits in this matter that should be left to agencies to
