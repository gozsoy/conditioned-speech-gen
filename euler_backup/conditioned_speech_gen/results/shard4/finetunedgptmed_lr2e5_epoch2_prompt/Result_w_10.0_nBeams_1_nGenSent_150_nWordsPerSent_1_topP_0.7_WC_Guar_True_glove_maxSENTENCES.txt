Mr. Chairman, this amendment would repeal H.R. 50 if GDP remains below 5 percent over the next 5 years and the bill as currently written would state that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who is not on the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, is required to make quarterly statements on the outlook for the United States economy.  This amendment is in line with the concerns of the committee. It would send a signal that if the economy grows below 5 percent, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board would make quarterly statements that would be quite different from what is currently in the bill.  As a matter of fact, I believe the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be required to make a report every quarter to the Congress, the Senate, and the President on the outlook for the economy.  I am opposed to this

There was an already-passed partial birth abortion ban in Alabama. The Supreme Court ruled that State ban unconstitutional because Alabama is a sanctuary State and did not have a problem with using its money to help the victims of the abortion.  I want to tell you about another State, Tennessee, that was recently found to have a part-time physician who performed an abortion. He was working in a car repair shop, making about $8 an hour. When the owners of the car repair shop wanted to sue the doctor, they sued because they were under the jurisdiction of Tennessee's law, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. This is the law that prohibits partial birth abortions.  Under this law, Tennessee could not have a physician in the car repair shop, working in a car repair shop, make up his mind whether or not he would perform

This is a bill for social security. We have had to deal with that in the past.  When we talk about welfare reform, there are a lot of people who want to argue that this is just about welfare reform.

Mr. Chairman; I will be very, very brief on my amendment. What this amendment simply does is simply say that the people that we are going to be helping in the country of the future and the people that are going to be in public housing should not be faced with a circumstance where they are going to have to go to the Board of Supervisors of the Federal Government to get back into public housing.  The problem is that the Federal Government has not kept up with the housing needs of this country.  Let me tell you what I am talking about. I am talking about the issue of community based public housing. This is the kind of people that are in public housing in the country of the future. I am talking about the children, the young people, the elderly, the disabled, and the handicapped that live in public housing

She quickly became known as one of California's leading advocates for women's rights and the empowerment of working women.  In addition to being an advocate for women's rights, Senator McBride was an outspoken advocate for environmental protection, a strong supporter of public housing and a strong advocate for families.  Senator McBride was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1940. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in history from the University

I think that the public will look at the polls and see that the American people are very concerned about the national debt, and that we need to reduce the national debt.

The Senator has presented what seems to be a very realistic package. I am certainly not going to respond to the question of the health care proposal that is favorably referenced in the CBO, but I am going to respond to the question of the CBO, because I think that is the issue. I will also state, and I think the Senator from Oklahoma has pointed out, that the issue is not whether or not the employer can offer health insurance to his employees, it is whether or not they can offer health insurance to their employees in their jobs. The employer can't, in my judgment, offer health insurance to his employees in his jobs, and that is the issue.  I do not see any reason why the employer cannot offer health insurance to his employees. We are talking about a $2,700 per year per employee per year

Madam Speaker, I rise today out of deep concern about the budget that was passed today by this House Budget Committee and this House this week that increases taxes by $6 trillion and increases spending by $20 trillion in the next decade and increases the debt rise to $21 trillion.  The cost of this will be borne by our children and our grandchildren, and we have a responsibility to do what we can to address it.  What the budget does is it eliminates the Children's Health Insurance Program, because it does not want to fund the children's health care.  The reason we do not fund the children's health care is because we want to reduce Medicare to pay for this tax increase.  This is a great example of what happens when the party of tax cuts is in control of the Congress.  It is a great example

This measure will allow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the number of children who will die from diseases that are preventable if we acted more aggressively on preventing these preventable deaths.  The last time I checked, children don't die from preventable deaths. The CDC estimates that about 11 million children die annually from preventable deaths. There is no question that we have a tremendous responsibility to ensure that we protect our children from preventable deaths.

For example, the Department of Education has decided to cancel its outreach programs for disadvantaged students.

We should not accept an invitation to play political games with the American people's security, to play politics with the security of our border and to play politics with the security of our ports of entry.  Our actions today reflect the bipartisan and bicameral decision we made a few days ago to accept a bipartisan immigration bill. That immigration bill included a number of amendments which would have protected our border. But we refused to accept those amendments, and so we were forced to accept the Republican budget resolution which cuts $1.2 billion from the Department of Homeland Security and provides zero funding for the border and ports of entry.

Speaker Pelosi is telling the American people, We're going to raise taxes on everybody else.  In her budget, House Democrats make drastic cuts in Medicare, education, and the environment. In fact, they even say they want to raise taxes on seniors.  But even as House Democrats attempt to impose an $8.5 trillion tax increase on America's families, American families are making record payrolls.

In addition, the Federal share of the State capital budget, $6.5 million, would be appropriated through a lease agreement with the Washington City Airport Authority and would not count against the cap.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the use of funds to amend the original concept of the United States-Peru Free Trade Agreement or the proposed United States-Peru Trojan Horse Agreement.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the United States Congress is not forced to change the Uruguay round text to accommodate a U.S. trade agreement with Peru.  The Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Peru was negotiated in good faith. It was in the interest of all involved to reach a negotiated agreement that was acceptable to both countries.  The Peru Free Trade Agreement with the United States is, and has been, fair and in the interests of both the U.S. and Peru. The agreement provides protection for American workers, is in the interest of American manufacturers, and is in the interest

Mr. Chairman, I reluctantly rise in direct opposition to the amendment, and I rise with opposition to direct spending cuts because it has nothing to do with how we spend money in this Congress. We should not reluctantly ask the people of the District of Columbia to spend $70 million more than they spend now.  Let me give you an example. Last year, the District of Columbia spent $2.5 million more than the President requested for their own affairs. They spent more than the people of New York, the District of Columbia, and Massachusetts combined. We should not have a situation where we ask the people of the District of Columbia to spend $70 million more than they spent last year.  Let me say that this amendment is a very narrow amendment.

Mr. Speaker, one of the great arguments that I have heard in this debate about college education is that we have been working for a number of years now to make higher education more affordable for wages. The Democrats want to double tuition at public universities. They want to double loan interest rates at public universities. They want to change the way that the Federal Government provides financial aid to college students, but they want to make it harder for middle-class families to go to college.  This bill will cut that. It will make it more expensive for middle-class families to go to college, and they will be penalized for going to college. I am concerned that the proponents of this bill are going to try to scare people and say, ``Oh, you are going to have to pay higher tuition. You are going to have to

Born in the small town of Enfield, Tennessee, Sergeant Taylor enlisted in the Army in 1984 and served for over 8 years before moving to Signal Mountain in 1992. In 2003, he was called up to the National Guard and deployed to Iraq, where he participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sergeant Taylor was wounded twice in Iraq and returned home to return to Signal Mountain.  The young Army sergeant is survived by his wife, Jill, and their two children, Jacob and Sarah.  Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Taylor has

Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to join the members of the Merchant Marine Committee in support of House Resolution 1227 designating the Federal Aviation Administration as the ``Commissioned Officer of the Year Committee'' for fiscal year 1996.  I am particularly pleased to have been an original cosponsor of this resolution and to have had the opportunity to meet with the FAA in the months leading up to the markup of the authorization bill, H.R. 3389.  This legislation is needed to ensure that the FAA has the necessary resources to meet its mandates, and to provide the full range of aviation and aviation related services to the Nation's airline passengers, to aviation interests and the general public.  The FAA has been doing a tremendous job in its mission, and I am confident that this authorization bill will give the FAA the resources it needs

The purpose of the Highway Trust Fund is to allow States to fund the Federal share of construction and maintenance of our Nation's roads and highways.

Mr. President, last week we voted on an omnibus bill that completed our long-delayed work on legislation that would extend tax relief for millions of working Americans and Republican tax cuts that would help the most well off Americans get a bill on the tax return they file. Those are the kinds of measures that help families pay their bills and provide incentives for businesses to create jobs rather than schemes to increase the debt.  I am pleased to announce that this omnibus bill has passed the Senate. We will soon be voting on final passage of the bill. This is the culmination of months of work by Senators and House Members on a bipartisan basis. I have had the privilege of working with Senator Collins and Senator Shelby on the legislation, and I look forward to working with them and their staffs in the months ahead to make sure that this legislation is enacted.

I believe that is the kind of information that the Intelligence Committee needs to have in its possession. I would suggest that this legislation will have to be a carefully balanced piece of legislation. We are talking about 25 percent of our people who are at risk of death or great bodily harm, a $500 million investment, a government program, and a public safety program that we have a responsibility to protect.

Mr. Speaker, the American people have spoken. A strong majority of Americans do not believe government should be involved in people's health care decisions whether they want it or not. But that question is being raised again and again by the Republican majority in Congress, and it is time that the American people stand up for the right to choose, for the right to make their own health care decisions.  Unfortunately, the Republican majority has a new approach to health care. This is an approach that could result in devastating consequences to the people who rely on health care coverage for their health. The health care reform legislation proposed by the Republicans in this House would cause all Americans to lose access to affordable health care, and it would also be an enormous burden on the Medicare trust fund.

Mr. President, I just wanted to say a few words to the Senator from Pennsylvania. Senator Santorum and I were in Pennsylvania this morning for a service. We visited the funeral of Congressman Halverson, who died in the line of duty on September 11, 2001. He was a very active member of our community, serving as mayor of Braddock Township. He was a member of the State senate.  He was a very good friend and someone who I respected greatly.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in advance of the back-to-back votes brought to the floor by the other side of the aisle to help Americans keep more of their hard-earned money so they can care for their own families and to help families continue to have the peace of mind to keep more of their hard-earned money so they can help their own efforts to care for their families.  The second bill before us, H.R. 1425, the CARE Act, does exactly what I think all of us in this body would want, and that is to ensure that we have the resources we need to provide care to the people who are sick.  I do not know how many times I have heard people on the other side of the aisle say, ``Well, we have to take care of people who have preexisting conditions

This bill is a good bill. It is a step forward. It is a step back.  But I will vote against this bill because I do not think we should have been asked to support a bill that did not go far enough to ensure that our public schools have the resources that they need to serve the needs of our children.  I want to talk about what I think are the real problems with this bill.  Let us take a look at the two principal problems.  First, the legislation provides for a 7-year extension of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a provision that was passed in 1965.  As a result of that, this

The House Armed Services Committee was able to adopt a policy last year that gave the President authority to spend up to $500 million of discretionary funds for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, to help pay for the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, but it did not give the President authority to borrow that money to fund the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. That was the policy of last year. It was a bipartisan policy, but it was a policy that was made in order by the Congress, the House of Representatives, and the Senate.

The Senator is quite right, with this one exception: We have provided ourselves with universal health care coverage that is not Government-run health care but American-made health care that is very similar to what Senator Dole, Senator Hutchison, and I and others have been advocating for for many years. We do not go out of our way to undermine those efforts.  I believe that there are some individuals who might have some reservations about what we are trying to do.

Mr. Speaker, drug prices can be higher in some cases for consumers than in other States because American taxpayers have been forced to take the lead in this case of drug price gouging by the government of Canada. However the intervention of American taxpayers in the Canadian market has not produced a better price for the American consumer.  Drug prices in Canada are lower than in the United States, but the average Canadian consumer pays $9 more for a pack of gum. A Canadian Government price of $3.90 is the equivalent of the American price of $1.50. The average Canadian price for Canadian cigarettes is over $2.50. That is a 30 percent price difference.  But, if American taxpayers are not interested in a higher price for the American consumer, they should join with the Canadians in eliminating the Canadian Government price gouging

I think it is important to note, if we look at the Medicaid Program, the Medicaid Program was created for people who were poor and who had no place to go.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was first passed in 2001, and since then it has had a remarkable effect on job creation, on the economy, and on America's priorities. It is the perfect example of what can happen when a strong economy is based on an effective economic growth plan that promotes growth, job creation, and tax relief for our citizens.  The act includes numerous provisions to strengthen our economy, boost jobs, and stimulate economic growth, including targeted tax credits for small businesses, tax cuts for working

Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my colleagues Senator Nickles and Senator Dorgan in offering the Small Business Jobs Payback Act of 1995. This legislation would transfer a portion of the $12.4 billion in new spending from the SBA program which we have already appropriated to small businesses.  Mr. President, as I have said before, we have all been dismayed by the decline in small business ownership and the increase in the number of business owned by the Government. A significant portion of the reason for this decline has been the Government's unwillingness to pay the promised loan forgiveness for first-time home buyers.  The Small Business Jobs Payback Act would increase the loan forgiveness program by $4.5 billion and also include a small increase in the State portion of the program, which would result in a $3

The Mojave National Park will be the largest open space park in the world, including more than 5 million acres of wildlands, including almost 500,000 acres of desert. It is also the only national park with a fully-fenced national park boundary.  Mr. Chairman, this legislation is not a perfect bill. There are some provisions that are not perfect. However,

Mr. Speaker, politics is all about choices. One of the biggest choices facing lawmakers is whether to vote for politics as usual or change the economy and Americans' lives.  I believe that Congress needs to have an economic stimulus plan that focuses on jobs and growth. In the process, we will ensure that America's financial system is sound and can handle any future downturn in the economy. We must also take action to stimulate job creation.  We can do both by creating new jobs and reforming our broken welfare system.  My amendment to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which I introduced with Congressman Charlie Rangel, allows the President to submit a stimulus plan that invests in American jobs and can create American jobs.  My amendment creates jobs by reducing red tape and ensures that those who earn less than $40,000 a year will

Mr. President, in 1935 Franklin Roosevelt had the foresight to realize that a welfare system which states could reform was the better way to go. Roosevelt's idea of ``poverty is not the result of luck, but of character,'' has guided our Nation's effort to achieve lasting and positive change. The result is a welfare system that works for millions of people, one that is better for the children of those who need it the most.  The main reason I am here today to speak on welfare reform is that I think the American people need to know a little bit about the issue. The system we have today is a shambles. It is a sham.  I believe the American people understand that we have a moral responsibility to try to get people off welfare. The President of the United States has said he is for welfare reform

As the economy continues to recover and American families are tightening their belts, I hope that we can quickly move ahead with this recession-busting legislation that will create jobs and rein in skyrocketing costs for all Americans.  Mr. President, the House is continuing its Republican assault on small business by bringing forward a bill that will block all new tax credits for small businesses, and even if the House passes its bill, we have a long way to go before it is enacted into law.  In the Senate, we have been working for months to develop a bipartisan small business tax relief bill that will provide incentives for job creation and provide tax relief for small businesses that are struggling with the current downturn.

They are talking about Iran's WMD.  We do not have to go to war with Iran. We can wait for them to be attacked. We have the best military in the world, but if they attack us, we will win. We will win by a war that is not in our national interest.  We should be focusing on diplomacy and less on war. We should not be waging a war in the Middle East based on a fabricated Iran threat.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important project. In the next couple of weeks Congress will consider the government funding bill that limits the ability of the Federal Government to spend taxpayer dollars. The Congress should be mindful that this bill represents an important step in restoring the fiscal health of our Nation. I want to speak briefly about the important provisions in this bill and the impact they will have on the District of Columbia.  Mr. President, this bill contains two major provisions. First, it limits the ability of the Federal Government to pay out Federal contracts for construction projects in the District of Columbia. Under current law, construction contracts are not considered to be public services in the District of Columbia. This means that the District of Columbia is unable to participate in many of the programs and activities of the Federal Government. For example, the District

Mr. President, next month, representatives of the 173 members of the NPT will gather in New York to remain in the United States for the first time in more than three decades and begin the process of providing materials and equipment to their former colleagues. As the world marks the anniversary of the original United Nations resolution on the demilitarization of Cyprus, it is appropriate to take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the security of the members of the NPT, their families, and the United States.  The NPT was established in the late 1950's and early 1960's to ensure that no nation possessed a nuclear weapon and to prevent nuclear proliferation. In that respect, it is important that we maintain strong and appropriate U.S. assistance to the NPT as it pertains to the NPT member states.  In addition,

Paul was only 6 months into his third year as a Chicago police officer when he was shot and killed in the line of duty while responding to a domestic disturbance call.  Officer Bauer was only 3 months into his second year of police service when he was killed in the line of duty while patrolling the western suburbs of Chicago. Paul's wife, Michelle, who was with him that night, and their children were there with him in the morning. Paul was the father of two children, Christopher and Christa.

Mr. President, yesterday, by a vote of 345 to 64, the House of Representatives agreed to accept the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] rule that requires all new television stations to be publicly named and shall be subject to the same disclosure requirements as other public morality or religion stations. The decision of the House of Representatives is a good one and I am proud that it was done so as God forbid an indecent, indecent, indecent, indecent program, would be aired on the air.  But it is a matter of concern to me that the FCC has now made it a Federal crime for a public morality or religion station to run a program that glorifies homosexuality or to broadcast a show that glorifies homosexuality.

Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak on my amendment encouraging the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide veteran choice for the Representative-to-Representative Program for veterans' doctors.  My amendment would ensure that veteran choice is available to VA doctors, and that there is a competitive process for veterans' choice. This is important to ensure that veterans' doctors are given equal access to VA care.  I support this amendment because it would promote access to VA care, and it would reduce the backlog of medical care waiting for veterans.  The Representative-to-Representative Program has allowed for the exchange of highly qualified physicians and surgeons for the lowest paid medical professionals in our country. Currently, many veterans seeking care in VA have no choice but to wait for an appointment at the local VA facility. This has led to a medical system that

Let me, if I may, respond briefly to that remark.  Mr. President, I listened with great interest to my colleague from New Mexico, who made a very eloquent statement about the meaning of the ABM Treaty. I had the opportunity to be at the Tokyo summit in 1992, and I recall that we had the opportunity to listen to the testimony of our President and others who had said that if we were to sign the ABM Treaty, we would be saying to Russia, ``You cannot maintain a nuclear deterrent.

They promised to reform our health care system, but they also promised to bring accountability to the system.  They promised to create jobs, but they also promised to get the economy moving again.  They promised to get the deficit under control, but they also promised to work on the budget.  I have worked on the budget since I came to the Senate. In my first term, I helped the Republicans pass the largest deficit reduction package

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. First of all, let us do the job that we have been sent here to do and that is to fund the President Bush dollars for ATP.  What this amendment would do is simply put a limit on the dollars that can be spent by the President on this program. If we want to give the President money, we have to do it in the context of the American people's priorities.  I would point out that, in fiscal year 1995, we have already put a $600 million cut in the program. That is the reason we have to make this effort. The President has requested $700 million more than the level of funding that was appropriated last year.  Now, I know that the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] has expressed some reservations about the ATP program

Well, I thank my friend. And I too want to just extend our appreciation for what you are doing in this effort because there are people who have come to our attention that they need help in their efforts to bring the promise of health care to those in this country that they do not have access to today. And the statistics that you have cited are just astounding.  Let me just read from the Associated Press report, a very critical report, and I know that you and your staff are going to be discussing that in a moment. And you quote from the Mayo Clinic: But what this really shows is that people who can afford it, who can work, who have the resources, are being denied coverage because of preexisting conditions.  The idea that we can turn this around in a short period of time, that there is

Madam President, the war in Iraq is the greatest challenge facing our country. Unfortunately, the strategy in Iraq has been bipartisan for some time now and Iraqis have overwhelmingly rejected the Bush administration's plan for Iraq. In fact, it is the only proposal the President has submitted for a strategy in Iraq. I am very disappointed that the President continues to drag his feet on this important issue.  The President's plan has been drafted in the face of overwhelming opposition from the Iraqi people and is a disaster for the country. It is a disservice to the people of Iraq to continue to propose a plan that the President has not yet approved. We all know that the President's plan is a colossal failure, and it is clear that he has been paralyzed by political considerations and a lack of a plan to achieve success in Iraq.  Madam President,

Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion and debate today about the Indian bill of rights amendments and the debate about the Senator from Nebraska's amendment.  I will say this. I believe that the Indian bill of rights amendment is a very good amendment. It is not controversial. It is a good amendment. It will not cost any money. It is very straightforward.  I believe it is important to pass this amendment. I believe that if the Congress is going to have the right to the people of this country, the people of this country have a right to the law, and they should have a right to enforce the law. I do not believe there is anything more important to this country than that.  I do not believe we have the right to legislate on this issue in this country without the courts having jurisdiction

Mr. Speaker, my friend from New York claims this is not political. Forty-five minutes ago Speaker Gingrich said Republican Members of Congress would not take this vote unless Secretary of State Powell agrees to sign a peace agreement in Bosnia. He also said this is not an attack on Clinton. He is a crook. He is a phony. I don't know where he got that information from.  I will say this. If you are going to defend Secretary Powell, then take your proof of it from the newspapers. The other side has been on the attack. They have been covering this issue with lies, distortions, and conspiracy theories.  Now, if the American people do not believe me, I will ask for a recorded vote. If they believe the press, I will ask for a recorded vote. If they believe the President, I will

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1775, the Act to protect the Alvarez Pueblo Apache Tribe from unlawful removal, as it is known, of members of the tribe. I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. Istook] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] for their leadership on this issue.  This legislation is very simple. It protects the Alvarez Pueblo Apache Tribe against unlawful removal, and, if it passes, it will remove the people of the tribe from a reservation that they have lived in for over 200 years. The members of the tribe have spent their lives serving the public, not just as a tribe, but as a people, and the present situation makes it more likely that they will lose their homes, their livelihoods, and

It is good public policy for Colorado to provide tax incentives for wind and solar power and for wind and solar jobs in Colorado and for those tax incentives for additional penalties for those who fail to invest in clean energy.  The legislation before us today contains a new tax credit for electric and natural gas companies that will create thousands of jobs in the energy industry and will help those companies develop the most efficient and efficient technology possible.  The bill also includes a new wind energy tax credit, a wind energy tax credit for new technologies, including new wind technologies.

Mr. Speaker, Congress is in the process of updating the Nation's agricultural policy for the coming year that will allow the policy to update itself and the economy as a whole as the Speaker of the House, the ranking minority member of the Committee on Agriculture, and the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee move forward with their oversight.  I would like to highlight one provision of the farm bill that is particularly important to me and my constituents in North Carolina. This provision allows for the export of American wheat and soybeans to nations that do not currently allow the export of U.S. wheat or soybeans. It is an important provision that will help to increase American agriculture exports.  There are some people in North Carolina who do not like this change in the law. One would think that this provision would be a controversial issue. In fact,

I think it is an important step for the American people to know what is happening, because this is not a partisan issue.

Yesterday, the Government Accountability Office issued its ruling on Boeing's protest of one of the Office of Management and Budget decision to cut jobs in 1,000 Federal civilian and military jobs. Boeing's contract to build the next-generation military fighter jet was terminated by OMB, which said that the Boeing team would have to go back to the drawing board to find a way to meet its contractual obligation. In response to this, Boeing argued that it is in fact the Federal Government that is responsible for the disruption of this contract and that the Government should step in and make sure that the contract is completed. The GAO said that this could be a violation of the statute of limitations because Boeing could not prove that the Government should have known it was breaking the law.  We need to take the time to find out what is going on in this
