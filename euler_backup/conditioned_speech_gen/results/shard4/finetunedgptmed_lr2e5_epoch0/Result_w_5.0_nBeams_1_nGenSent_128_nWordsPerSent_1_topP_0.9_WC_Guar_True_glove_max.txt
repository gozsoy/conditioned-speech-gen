ohio plan speaker 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the Michigan Legislature passed a bill last week that will reform public schools by cutting funding for the Michigan program that prepares and is ready to move a plan to replace the failed No Child Left Behind State standards with Ohio's Common Core State-Based curriculum.  I am not an expert in education, but I have heard Speaker Ryan tell students and I know we must be ``fairly aggressive'' in having our public schools tested. I strongly oppose that because this year's testing standards are worse than they ever were and too comprehensive. The results are almost a year and a half away, and millions of children do not get to know that their parents

Last evening, the Clinton administration sent an emergency supplemental appropriation bill to the Pentagon for $390 million for fiscal year 1999. This money will be needed until the administration certifies that it can allocate additional funds needed for filling filling reserved military and security posts. The amendment offered by Mr. Schrock and Mr. Rahall would put the funds on a glidepath to a

This is especially important because of a recent report that showed that more than two-thirds of people in the world have very little to approach today's resources in terms of food or nutrition. And, even as we bring intellect, creativity, and ingenuity to bear in the fight against hunger, it is nearly impossible to know how to address this problem. It is not the economy that can stop hunger, it is the

Mr. President, I will vote for the reconciliation bill because this is what we should be doing: We should be doing what Congress wants us to do. We should be saying ``Senate Democrats Senate Republicans vote to provide all Americans with health care coverage at a time when most of our country is experiencing the health care crisis we have faced for the last 3 years with great difficulty and tragedy of record proportions.'' And then when Henry Morgenthau, after almost dying as a result of asbestos exposure, found out the Government was working with him, he signed off on the result. So do I agree with all of those things? Yes. I would agree with these

Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to be here to support legislation to prevent individuals from being able to take their children to Washington State's first congressional delegation in 20 years. Last year the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight held a hearing that asked both the Department of Education and the Department of Justice to begin to go after this issue immediately. Unfortunately, there are still many other forms of child abuse that are being carried out without public accountability, and we must continue to push for the recognition of the danger of child abuse in our society.  I am proud to have introduced this legislation to put pressure on the Department of Education to take action and start educating the

In fact last week they said they had a bill that they had made up that was a week ago but would not allow for the actual passage of the Senate legislation which would put the annual budget convention in full session. The issue is what budget conference agreement do we want, the Senate conferees, to allow us to get to this conference

The Tax Code provides important tax information for the American people that provide a connection between the tax we pay and the investment opportunities we can access. By simplifying the Tax Code, we can finally ensure that each taxpayer is receiving the information they need to make tax-free decisions.  Over the past several years, the Tax Code has been grossly simplified, making our financial and personal decisions more efficient and more friendly. But millions of families who make

Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by saying that I did not support this particular speaker today who seemed to be speaking on a different subject at the same time than I did. I think I have found on this particular subject that the debate in general terms on the floor of the House of Representatives has been regimented by the regiment infantry forces that have been over there the past 10 years.  There are so many of them that were not able to make it to a uniform uniform because of very political disagreements on what side of the aisle they were on or on what issue. I think it has been more of a justified thing.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I was there when the minority tried to cut the child support from the budget of this House. It was literally cut to us from the tax cut we wanted to take up because we decided we could not raise enough money to protect our kids against their horrible break adage, ``pay the bills.''  It is time to continue to protect our children. We cannot weaken our security to pay our children to protect our security. We must keep it up or our security.

But I think this CPI correction will, hopefully, help us to broaden the base of support for the kind of deficit reduction package that we need in order to have success in 2013.  So we had hoped to put a deficit reduction package together that would make progress. I have worked on that. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to work on this as we work on fiscal reform. So I think this is a good bipartisan bill. It

When I came here in 1993, I had a mandate to protect the interests of the American people. And my priorities were clear. One was to reduce spending for programs which we must constantly expend money for. I cut taxes and cut spending.  As Senator Kerry so eloqu

However the Commerce Committee has passed a bill that is clearly designed to further the ambition of the Bush tax cuts and drive the economy out of the ditch.

repeat home president 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I again thank the President for his recognition of the importance of a new and different approach to border security than the old one which has been used for the last 10 years when this country was home to the most uncontrolled border in the world and our criminal offenders overstayed their visas so they could get into the United States again. Let me repeat that again. The President of the United States has recognized that the border itself needs to be protected from people and drugs entering the United States. The President of the United States is insisting that the border be searched more closely to screen out illegal immigrants as well as law abiding people.  The current plan

Madam Speaker, since the last election the Democrats have been trying to convince the country that they are the party of the people and not the government of the special interests but that they support the security of the small businesses and that they support the interests of middle class Americans. They have been able to convince the country that if you will uphold the Constitution and serve the people of this country, you will get the help of the American people in paying for Government and in Ukraine and elsewhere.  Now, before the election, I was opposed to raising the debt ceiling because I was concerned that this would be a series of hyperboles that are not defensible.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw my colleagues' attention to the rule for H.R. 2728, the Health Education and Welfare Reauthorization Act of 2006. This rule contains a number of provisions that will help to protect the health and welfare of our Nation's working and middle class families and order the Federal Government for the first time into an unprecedented period of budget surpluses over the next decade. Speaker Gingrich, under the leadership of Speaker Gingrich, has worked tirelessly to expand Federal role in health care coverage and to address Medicaid as a separate program. As one of the most conservative Members of this House, I am happy that this rule

I oppose that day as a day to condemn war and to not support troops who have the mission of fighting terrorism. It is one more sign that the Iraq war has failed and Iraq has fallen in Iraq and Iraq has fallen in Iraq. Baghdad must be liberated. The Army must be reorganized into a military police force of efficient troops, not a shadow of itself. We must provide adequate funds for Iraq. We must secure Iraq's humanitarian access through a no-fly zone and a ban on weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's oil revenues

It's called the National Law Enforcement Members Appreciation Act of 1997.  In general, the Federal Government has a commitment to protecting America's communities.
