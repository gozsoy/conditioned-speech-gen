Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Ohio for his care for this bill and for bringing it to the floor and making the point that it is not a leftwing bill. The Conyers-Collins bill has a right-wing pro-life component because it seeks to reduce the number of abortions in this country. It is an amendment that was filed on May 26, but it is not made in order until June 28. I think that is very telling. That is just an admission of fact that this is what they are doing.

Mr. Speaker, it is over a year since Iraq invaded Kuwait and nearly 1 year since the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize this war that has devastated much of Iraq, burned homes, killed civilians, and maimed so many. The humanitarian situation remains dire and troops continue to spend hours in total darkness before fighting in the last day of July. The United States is still in Afghanistan as a result of this war, and more than 300 Americans are dead. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been displaced and millions are without food and medicine.  Congress has failed to act. However, the Bush administration and Congress can at least have one major resolution to

We have an out-of-control spending problem here that no one here has come to some kind of agreement about. I think the whole point of the conference on this spending bill is that it will finally bring it to the floor. They got to get it up here so the people can vote on it. It has to be

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today, the House will consider H.R. 1535, the American Family Partnership Act of 2019, a bill that will further strengthen and expand the American Family Partnership. As the day of our resolution of war in Afghanistan approaches, the military and our veterans need our continued and more active involvement in the war against terrorism and in counterproliferation. In addition, it will help provide important support to our men and women serving our country in combat.  The House passed H.R. 1535 by unanimous consent earlier this year, and the Senate passed the bill by voice vote

<|endoftext|>A 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center and the University of Southern California and the Center for American Progress revealed that a record 71 percent of people in the United States believe that a major policy proposal by the President should come to the Congress for a vote. The last step before a major legislative decision should be made by the President, not by a majority of Members of Congress.  Of course, it is not that that is impossible. Senators can filibuster a proposal before the vote, as has happened before for many of the issues that Americans agree upon. But the fact is that the Congress should act on a proposal when unanimous consent is sought and the

Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on this and for all the work that we have put into this rule for this measure. It was also a chance for us to ask a question to the President of the United States and to let him decide the course of action that we need to take on this issue. The President has said that we have a situation that needs to be resolved. In this case that is very clear to him and to the American people as far as the safety of the American people and the security of our country.  For the last 3 weeks it was on the House floor the President sat in an all-white Cabinet

Madam Speaker, just yesterday this body was gripped with a particularly vicious attack against our police officers. Not one American was harmed. The media and our allies were quick to leap on the incident and cast its wrongful accusations as a blow to the National Guard and the public safety. But here in the United States Congress we have a distinct alternative view of the events that occurred that day in Charlotte. We had a Federal judge rule in our favor and grant bond for the first of these two officers without the claims being made that these officers were part of a terrorist cell.  I was proud that we had that verdict because I believe that the fight against terrorism is
