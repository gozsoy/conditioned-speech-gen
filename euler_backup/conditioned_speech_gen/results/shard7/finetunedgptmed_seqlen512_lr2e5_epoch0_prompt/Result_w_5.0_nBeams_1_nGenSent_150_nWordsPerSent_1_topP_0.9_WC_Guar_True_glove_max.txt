Mr. President, today, the Senate has approved landmark legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for 1 year. That legislation is a critical first step in the long-term reform of the nation's schools that will provide students the education that they need to learn and excel and will help to ensure that children are able to find a better life for themselves and their children when they leave school child care.  This legislation would not be possible without the generous support from my colleagues and local school boards in Michigan and across the Nation who have worked so hard to make sure that the program remains open and in place for many years to come. It is also a reflection of the bipartisan support this legislation has received from the Governors of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois.

Mr. President, I rise to express concern about the budget deal that seems to have been in the works for too long. Concern with the way spending is being structured is bipartisan, but when the Republican-controlled Congress is not willing to work with Democrats to produce a budget that actually benefits the American people and their families, it should be a huge problem in this country for the majority of Americans to grow crops and pay the bills on a daily basis.  In looking at a couple of examples, we can begin with the Agriculture Department, which has been steadily shrinking and having cut some of its most important work.  At the same time, we hear that there are cuts in the Interior Department and that we have cut the Department of the Interior by $7 billion.

contest consent senate 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I am pleased the administration has decided not to contest condition 9 in Senate ratification of the American Security Act. The consent agreement and certification that the bill would be subject to a vote without a single vote in opposition is the best political announcement I have ever seen in the past 6 months. The vote was scheduled for next week and would have been scheduled for this Thursday night contest.  I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to vote on this bill next week, and I urge the passage of the American Security Act.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Our colleagues across the aisle in the Republican leadership know what is going on here. They have been given the jersey for the last 2 months now to work out a deal on funding the government and paying our bills.  The Republican leadership has already tried to raise the debt ceiling of this country and have threatened to block the President from raising Maryland's debt limit until after the election in November. In fact, the Republican leadership also says they want the Massachusetts and Connecticut debt ceilings to be raised before the election.

Usage of this line, ``don't get it wrong, don't change it,'' is grossly offensive to people who rightfully believe in equity, that we should be sensitive toward people with disabilities and their rights, that our country is reclaiming its own vision, its own unique vision, and that we must understand all people of all backgrounds and experience, be mindful that all voices, regardless of their backgrounds, should be heard, that all viewpoints are equally valued, and that we respect and honor the important rights of people with disabilities.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Berman amendment. The defense export loan guarantee program has been a key program that has made an enormous difference for the United States of America and has kept our military strong at home and our allies around the world and helped reduce military spending in the public budget. While the defense export policy has not always performed to its full potential, the funds that are provided through this program guarantee that our defense industry will be able to provide our country with key supplies that it needs to make our Nation stronger. This program is important to our Nation's security, and this amendment attempts to cut off funding for the program at a time when it is also beginning to make a dent in the deficit. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Berman amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

First of all, we talk about the problems of China. What is the relationship between the U.S. and China, what the trade situation is? That is a matter that will get resolved in the two-thirds of Americans that are really interested in having that kind of partnership.  Secondly, China is a leader in this region.

I thought some of the things we are hearing this morning are a little bit perplexing to me, because I think the people on the other side of the aisle have gone out and put their money where their mouth is. There are babies being born in the United States that are being born today and we know, the European women are talking about the babies, and we know, the Jewish women are talking about the babies, so where are the votes?  Why are we not being realistic and honest about where our Nation is on a year-to-year basis? I do not think people are really looking at the numbers.

The President of the United States has not asked for the authorization of the United States military for some major wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan for a number of reasons that need to be laid to rest for a few brief minutes at least before offering this amendment. No major war in Iraq has been started for a long period of time and there is not an increase in costs to reduce the complexity of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has said so on many occasions. No major war has been started and the American taxpayers have not asked for it. We are now trying to slow down the drawdown in Iraq.  There are some ideas floating around the place about a delay in getting to war with Iraq, but we

Section 116 also would prevent the Park Service from limiting the inspection of the National Parks or Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to areas where signs directing boat safety inspection are in use.  If the Department fails to include a right-of-way inspection requirement, it will be reasonable to rely on other penalties to obtain necessary information from the visitor.

I hope that if the rules are approved by the Rules Committee guidelines are carried out in the next few days, the budget will be balanced in 7 years.

Mr. President, this amendment would establish a commission on postal reorganization, basically a BRAC. It would determine if Congress is adequately funding postal reform efforts on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and after the fact. It would have both oversight and accountability to determine if Congress has succeeded and is meeting the needs of the postal community and if Congress has not succeeded or is not meeting the needs of the community as it is today as President Bush contemplates reducing the size of the Postal Service and moves toward privatization.  We have both had success in stopping union consolidation at the Postal Service and there has been a large dropoff in the revenue generated by our Nation's mail service. We know that competition and competition drive the cost of mail more down. It makes more money for the Postal Service. Yet our post offices and post offices have fallen victim to the mail. That

Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Penny Celeste Forrest of Waco, Texas, who passed away on December 13 after a long battle with a rare form of cancer and a battle to win the November 10 election to the State Senate which would have put her in office for a third term as she was on her way to becoming a three-term Texas State Senator for November 2009 and 2010 and November 2011 before she was taken ill on December 3 at the age of 28 months June 22, 2011.  She was the oldest woman to ever be elected to the Texas State Senate by a margin of 75 to 31. Penny was not only a leader in her community, she was a top-notch judge, attorney, legislator, and advocate for the people of Texas and our great State.  Her passion for public service propelled her to become one of

I believe his particular example of the truly comprehensive health care plan and the fact that we can grow it as we grow the government is something that very many of us would like to see endangered or, in many instances, simply eliminated altogether in this country in the near future.  One of the other provisions in this important bill is the important species recovery bill, which is truly a national treasure.

This is a community that has a rich heritage that extends past a number of generations, and yet was born as an outpost of the great Italian American community of Denver, in 1932 Joseph W. Grover founded this place called Italian International Airport, and the airport was named after him. I'm also happy to say that this community has been led by Speaker G. Kline, who led the effort on this legislation that created this place and named it after the great Speaker of the House, Michael B. Grover.  In 1938, the U.S. Congress created the Italian American National Heritage Area in Denver to teach new generations of immigrants about the beauty of the New World and how our country was a

These agencies deal with $2 billion dollars worth of Federal law enforcement equipment and training funds for their law enforcement agencies and other agencies around the Nation to help combat drugs, weapons of mass destruction, and weapons of mass destruction program. Navy Yard was forced to hire 3,500 police officers to conduct its ongoing criminal investigation at the site. Subsequently, the $750,000 spent at DCIAC to procure volts for the military equipment was diverted to fund Blackwater Security Systems.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment provides additional authority for the Committee to pursue investigations on the use of DIA equipment at Blackwater, but it does not bar the Internal Revenue Service from using

Mr. Speaker, today we will consider an issue of fairness to farmers who have invested millions in the construction of the small business loan program and paid no more than the total of what is offered for the last 5 years of the Small Business Administration today.  The American people should be asking themselves how they would like to finance their children's college education by giving them a higher interest rate on the small business loan. The biggest flaw in the SBA's current system is its confusing and burdensome process for evaluating creditworthy applicants.  I will use the example of one business owner, Nels, whose family has spent more than $6,000 constructing the foundation for the new inner city Greenpoint Market. One of Nels' biggest responsibilities is to help the City rebuild and move the market into the new outer beltway in the hopes

Mr. President, in recent years more and more observers have noted Africa's failing states, ungoverned regions, and civilian and military problems as well as the hundreds of thousands of people who have died as a result of the long and violent civil war there since independence from Britain in 1960. Despite many hard and some short-term reforms including limited official control and the opening up of the markets for food and medicine, Africa is a ``failed state'' of one kind or another.  Early in President Carter's term President Clinton has called for the United States to draw a clear and lasting distinction between the struggle for freedom and the political, economic, and security goals we should pursue. The stakes in the civil war are high: while both sides claim to be winning, and in some cases have gone so far as to claim that their opponents cannot possibly win,

So, as long as States have this language, we would have no problem that they would be able to go forward.  It does, however, raise a certain question as to whether it is clear to me and to others that we need to sort of include in the formula some language that will allow these States to get a lot of money out of the Federal Government.

Mr. President, in our search for ways to eliminate the crushing poverty that afflicts billions of people around the world, we often focus on the poor as those least able to pay their debts owed to governments and to the United States Government. The poverty among the poor, however, is much more serious because of the fact that it is the most pressing social problem in our country today. In fact, among the five States that support the initiative under consideration by the Senate, Mississippi has the highest rate of poverty among all States and the lowest rate of income for any State.  This poverty exists because the U.S. Government does not provide the money necessary to provide the basic goods and services needed to put food on the table for people. In fact, in Mississippi, one-third of children live in poverty. Ninety percent of children

The result of Senator Santorum's effort will be a reform of the Senate that will prevent this body from in the future in the same financial and political danger to which it has fallen in the last 15 years and in 2005 when it was again in August April February August October February. It is imperative that the Senate adopt this legislation to ensure that Members of the Senate are not rewarded with perks and privileges that have been granted to Members of the White House, Congress or the media.

Madam President, I rise today in support of Dr. John Fleming's nomination to be the Secretary of the Army. I believe Dr. Fleming is a strong and willing partner for the Department of the Army and a well-qualified economic development leader who has invested $60 million in two projects from $50 million each to help improve energy supplies and service our Army bases throughout the country. Over time Dr. Fleming has invested $10 million dollars in every single one of these projects.  I also want to commend the administration for the good work they have done on energy policy for the last decade. Prior to this administration, the administration lacked a strong and consistent position on the problem of climate change and had been unwilling to commit to a comprehensive strategy for confronting the problem. In the final analysis, I think the administration under President Obama has invested in an

It would provide a health plan based on personal responsibility and provide real access to quality, affordable care to a fraction of the middle-class earners.

This amendment does just that. It does give flexibility to the District to go after some of our backlog and allow our businesses to grow while they still have time to do that while they go out and actually lose time doing business and other businesses in the District of Columbia who need flexibility to make their money in other ways.

I have long supported a stronger arms embargo on Bosnia in security and humanitarian terms, particularly for the Bosnian people, but also the people of Srebrenica, who suffered from Serbia's genocidal actions there, as well as the women and children who were massacred. For those reasons I join my colleagues in urging the President to continue the arms embargo.  Madam President, we now find out that as of May 1996, the Bosnian Serbs had taken over the city of Sarajevo and over 100,000 people, most of whom were women and children. How many of them were exterminated by the Serbian troops?  As I have said many times, we must begin to seriously reex

While the Speaker of the House is marching forward with big plans to increase the cost of heating oil, we are reducing the benefits of smart energy policies. And they do have two big problems.  The first is that President Obama's energy policies call for too much drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and offshore in the Outer Continental Shelf of the Arctic. With regard to the Outer Continental Shelf, Mr. Speaker, Madame Speaker, the reasons are well known. The Arctic is one of the few places in the United States where there are no pollution concerns. The owners of oil and gas in that region of the world are ``shovel-ready'' and their exploration activities are getting done.

If I might, because I think this is an important letter, I wish to report to the Senate the status of health insurance for Members of Congress and their staffs with respect to this bill that was just passed that is not called up now that is called up this afternoon and that is called up later in the week that is called up this weekend and that will affect the System Administration offices and will also affect the agency staffs of the offices. This letter informs us that Members may be receiving security warnings in the inspector general's office of that agency.  I would hope that this information will be shared with Members so they can know what the status of these health care benefits for their staff and their offices. I see the gentleman from California [Mr. Dreier] and the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Shaw] are here with us

Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of all of the lines in the sand on this issue of funding the government and not just the political debate on the issue of whether we need to cut the Federal Government or not have people get up and say we need to spend less than Americans have had to pay for their standard of living for the last 60 years of their life to pay for this bill that will cost more than the cost of health care for one of our great quality of life provisions--but they won't tell us who they are because they think that is an unfair situation.  Lou Stenslade from Indiana, when he was in the House--and it may be here today--he was so brilliant that he realized that he had $34 million to spend for one thing. He wasn't going to spend any on

Mr. Speaker, today, I stand with the United Automobile Workers by honoring General Motors workers and workers in the auto industry in my district in Detroit and throughout the country for their tireless work in creating the future for our Nation. In the last couple of decades automobile and light truck manufacturing jobs have come back to America and the American worker and his family can be proud of the well-paying jobs they have created that are making it possible for them to care for their children and grandchildren for child care and food and clothing.  When I was elected to Congress, I promised to ``fight to make America a country of the people, not the powerful.'' So today I join the rest of the American people in a nationwide march to honor the hard work and dedication of the workers of the United Auto Workers union and the workers of General Motors.

Mr. Speaker, we are considering the important matter of whether the United States should extend an embargo to the People's Republic of China by establishing the first American military presence in the country to combat Chinese aggression and to work to support the United States-China relationship.  The United States ought to have the leverage to achieve our objectives if we choose. But, of course, that is not the case. The President, like most of his predecessors, is acting primarily because he believes that doing so will maximize his political power and further his personal political advancement.  It is no accident that the pressure for an immediate withdrawal has been strong. China has attacked us with a guerilla warfare strategy against the United States--hundreds of miles from the Chinese border. We are now watching the damage to our economy, foreign policy, and, tragically

seniors deeper constitution 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2560, which attempts to manipulate the Congressional Budget Office to approve tax cuts for the very wealthy instead of allowing seniors to receive their benefits under the Social Security Act in 2005. Republicans continue to try to push through legislation to allow the President to extend the Bush tax cuts beyond January 1, 2001. The only way to expand Social Security into deeper funding is to allow the President to provide continued tax cuts for the American people who would have to pay for them because the Constitution does not allow for spending more than $250 billion in revenue to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. And Republican leaders say they oppose $350 billion in revenue for new Social Security tax cuts, but their bill would add more than $350 billion to the deficit in 7 years.  I cannot believe Republicans would take the time

As the only New York City public official to rise to defend service delivery, I am convinced that the recent wave of demerits has set back the Postal Service's efforts to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding population.  This legislation would simply provide postal workers and employees with more time to meet their needs for information, transportation, and supervision. It would also expand the Postal Service's commitment to customer service, and would increase the quality of customer service for all consumers.

I urge all Members to support this legislation because the committee and the Armed Services Committee have made the very best of what they have. If the average increase in spending for the current fiscal year was 5 percent above last year and rise to 9.5 percent, it would be the biggest one-time peacetime increase in a half century.  This conference agreement contains $816.7 billion in new budget authority for the Department of Defense. It also contains $40.2 billion in cuts for our Nation's special operations forces and special programs. But we must take a close look at how much of these savings will be spent to ensure our troops are well

Mr. President, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world for a number of reasons. It hit Europe first and now we are being warned that it may be even bigger. It took many years before we knew the health of the world would be so bleak. People suffered flu disease even though they had been vaccinated for influenza because the flu virus strains were so different. The flu vaccine was injected into patients through the nose rather than onto the skin or injected into a parenteral route which is only safe for children. It is very difficult to detect the flu vaccine without seeing the tiny cocoons that are created on a person's face and nose. The children in my home State of Texas will need many years of training to recognize the cocoon and how to operate on a patient without pulling it out.  In 1914, the

So it should be perfectly clear to both parties why this is necessary to guarantee that States and cities and others who already have permanent laws which pay for the benefits of President Bush's so-called Common Deficit Reduction Plan, plus payment to cities which have also signed a support agreement to be paid by that plan, are not subject to unilateral rescissions of their pension obligations from their central State pension fund.

Public school funding is now at a record $50 billion--$50 billion more taxpayer money than it was in fiscal year 1995, even though the budget released last month budgeted $6.8 billion for public school appropriations, about 4 percent more than for 1995. This money is necessary because in 1993, every State spent less than it received in education, and Washington spent more per capita on its public schools than any other State except Louisiana and Mississippi.

Mr. President, today, I want to say a few words about one of my most beloved friends, Senator Bob Dole from Kansas. His life and work have touched so many of us in Washington, DC. His achievements, his influence, his depth of thinking and his history will always be remembered.  Before being elected to the Senate in 1984, Bob Dole was a State senator and Detroit auto dealer. In 1986 he left the auto dealers and started his own agency in U.S. Capitol City.  Bob Dole has been an essential adviser to President Reagan, Congress, State and local governments, farmers, small business owners, and those of us who love to bring young people together. He has always been friendly and friendly. His presence is always welcomed and the Senate has a tradition of thanking him on occasion.  I

Mr. Chairman, I would like to pick up on the last couple words that were just made by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee on the basis of the most recent administration analysis that the situation on the country's military budget is the worst we have seen since World War II and that we are continuing to fund the military at a time of substantial military spending cuts that have been ongoing for more than a decade and a half and are well beyond the chapter 8 years that Congress is now dealing with and could not do a better job of balancing our books than the committee has done on education.  The chairman was quoted in a Politico article this past weekend as saying that we should keep our hands off the military. What this is suggesting is that the military shouldn't be held accountable. We shouldn't stop at the status quo, let's

I think that comes close.

That is why I believe the only way to burn the heat is to talk about health care and, if we do that, we will be able to move this thing forward. But that is not what we are doing, and that is why we should never be in this position, when we are at a stalemate. We need to come together and find ways to get things done in a bipartisan manner.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, I am very pleased to join my colleague in paying tribute to Wells Fargo in the State of Missouri. Wells Fargo is a pioneer in the health care and credit card industry. From national offices in New York to more than 30 countries and territories across the globe, they continue to make sure that we are confident we can come together to achieve the very things we pleased to do as Democrats in Congress on health care reform.  Wells Fargo is a proud member of America Health Care Reform legislation and immigration reform legislation in the Senate. Since coming to the Senate in 2002, Senator Dodd has worked to reform immigration law for good and to secure our borders.  Senator Dodd worked tirelessly to protect our Nation's lives. When his health was seriously compromised in September of 2009, he worked with our colleagues in the Senate to extend much needed disability

Mr. Chairman, it is not as though the House has had this debate. It never has. It was not discussed in the Rules Committee. So I will say to the gentleman from New Jersey that he is doing a disservice to the House if he does not go on the record and support this amendment which will protect thousands of women of our border region from having to buy their own birth control in order to prevent the government from mandating that they purchase it from the Government itself. But this amendment would make it even easier for the Government to mandate that law-abiding citizens purchase this constitution.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

americans legislation provide 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2 to repeal the 2010 health care law. Americans have come to expect some measure of protection for their health care bills under this legislation. The law fails to provide real transparency and due process for cost-payer-funded legal actions, strips protections from nearly half of Americans with pre-existing conditions, and prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to develop or administer a plan to improve coverage. Unfortunately, a majority of Americans who have seen the job creators' bill would not have been able to pass this legislation in their home States.  We now have several bills to repeal the health care law that were both hard-fought and won. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership is rushing to block these efforts so they can avoid the people's economic concerns.  The majority has chosen to ignore the growing challenges

Other medical providers in other parts of the country are also trying to do the same thing and have done so in the past as well, and if we are going to try and make sure that the American people have the same health care coverage as President Clinton and President Bush and Bill Clinton and others, then I think the best way to do it is to pass this bill.  It is not perfect. It has some things that could improve it. But I am very supportive of this bill.  I appreciate the fact that the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee worked out a compromise that does include a number of the things I mentioned earlier on here.  I hope that we will be able to work through these with Senator Vitter,

The President of the United States has a historic mandate. He has authority to borrow money from the public to pay down the national debt. He has an opportunity to reduce the deficit. If he chooses to use that authority, he should not incur the tax burden on the rest of us.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I knew Jack Kemp and worked with him as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and also for the Governor of California in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other areas of government support.  I want to talk about what we have here, in this legislation. The children of the uninsured and low-income families in this country are most at risk of experiencing homelessness. Their children are already living in family violence and neglect situations. Children with autism suffer from anxiety, tics, and repetitive and escalating behaviors and are at increased risk of having any such issues associated with homeless parenting.  I want to say, Mr. Speaker, this is a balanced bill. This has been improved in response to recommendations from the Baltimore Children's Zone Commission, and

Mr. Chairman, I would remind my colleagues that this amendment is new. It applies only to small businesses, rather than to big businesses that have a huge presence in this country or where they do business all over this country and to companies that sell our products overseas and this Member has been working on this issue for some time.  We have not worked together on this before in the Committee on Rules to have a vote of ``yes'' that I have colleagues in this Chamber come before us and vote yes and you will hear of my colleagues' business interests and be introduced by those businesses that sell here to us because they see that this amendment would actually change the vast majority of small businesses' lives in this country.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I am pleased to vote in favor of the Taxpayer Relief Act, which has been working its way through the Senate and the House of Representatives for the last several months now. Americans know their taxes are too high. They need to know what their tax rate is going to be, and they need to know what incentives they will have to comply with their obligations in order to have their money treated fairly. They need to know how they are going to make their hard-earned money more productive.  Let me be clear, I would like to see all income, and even capital gains, taxed fairly in this country. All of this is what this bill will do.  We all know we have too much debt and too many deficits. We all know the dollar is rising at a rapid rate, and we have just a few

Congress must rescind the spending limits that were imposed on the President in the fiscal year 2008 budget bill. With the Dodd bill enacted in 2008, Congress also granted to the President a waiver for the SPEAKER pro tempore to exercise the class action option.  In adopting this class action bill, Congress wisely looked to the experiences of other countries, including Spain and Japan. The reform efforts of the Japanese received a lot of media attention, but the reforms applied only to the U.S. Solicitor General, not to other trial lawyers who might face similar restrictions.

It is about abortions in the most limited circumstances in all circumstances in all States in all States in the world and in the most limited circumstances in States in Germany and in Norway. It is about women's constitutional right to choose.  Again, the purpose of this amendment is to prevent all abortions except for rape and incest. And there is absolutely nothing in this amendment that would stop a woman from having an abortion. The ultimate ruling in these cases is in the consenting physician's

crimes war terrorist 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, most Americans recognize that our continued success in preventing another terrorist attack on American soil would be even more dramatic and dangerous if Congress were unable to fund the war against terrorism with an even larger national debt than we have today. Unfortunately, we know this and are pursuing solutions to avoid another terrorist attack by changing the way the war is being financed.  This bill would prevent another terrorist attack and provide the resources necessary to continue to prosecute crimes committed by al Qaeda and other groups. The bill addresses the U.S. military's failure to keep both the nations of Afghanistan and Iraq free of terrorists. The problem that we face in both countries is caused by a lack of meaningful Federal resources to conduct homeland security operations and our inability to fund a host of other important Federal programs.  With only a few percent of the world's population

Although this amendment is within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I do ask for its immediate consideration. It concerns legislation to provide for the provision of gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf and under the terms of section 203 of the act which would provide for $25 million for feasibility studies of such provision. Amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by my friend from New York would be further discussed on this side as we proceed.  cells issue No substantive changes to title XVIII of the act, nor would any changes in the statute have any effect on that language or title XVIII of the act. the Amendment is substantially identical to section 204 of the bill, which concerns the United States supply of gas to India.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to speak in morning business about a bill that I introduced in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the same day that the agreement was reached with the Government Printing Office regarding a loan program to help pay for a program that I proposed that would allow subsidized loans to be paid back to taxpayers while subsidies and protections for the big oil companies continue to be in the legislation.  Let me be very clear. The Federal Government should not be handing out taxpayer money to some of the most profitable companies in America, because they are getting the lion's share of the benefits from the bailout that we have seen.  Companies like Shell Oil, ExxonMobil, BP, ConocoPhillips, and Enron are piling up enormous profits. As the oil companies continue to continue

There were 11 Republicans and 16 Democrats in the Senate who voted for that amendment on the Budget Committee, so I wanted to send it to the desk so there would be ample opportunity for discussion on it. Unfortunately, the chairman, Senator Isakson, objected to the procedure. He objected to the consideration of the amendment. So this time we have not yet been able to discuss the Senator's amendment.

The bill before the House today strikes a reasonable compromise in terms of reform and incorporates a number of new policy features which my Republican colleagues have worked hard to put into the bill. Speaker Gingrich and Senator Obey have offered several good amendments that have been thoroughly debated and have helped significantly to strengthen the bill. All of them had much debate, just as the markup for H.R. 1399 was much more contentious than the markup for this legislation, but all have helped create the good-faith compromise needed by the House.  I support the legislation offered by my Republican colleagues as the best protection of American trademarks in

For too long, the reconciliation bill has been focused on deficit reduction. I and the other Republican freshmen in the leadership helped to achieve the largest economic deficit reduction plan in Social Security history. We have been opposed to big cuts to Social Security and the Budget Committee report eliminates provisions that would reduce our deficit to its lowest level since the start of the Great Depression.  For the last 7 years, the fiscal and economic policies of the last Congress have made a mockery of our fiscal sanity. For decades, the Tax Code has been put on a path toward insolvency, forcing our economy to rely on

Republicans would likely vote ``yes'' Gingrich, ``yes'' Dent, ``yes'' Casey, and yes in an effort to increase Republicans' chances of winning elections. Democrats would likely vote ``no'' Gingrich, ``no'' D'Amato, and ``no'' Clyburn.

block amendment contract 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, this amendment has the effect of placing a serious impediment, if not an obstacle to contract negotiations that are already underway between the United States and the European Union for the sale of 70 percent of their natural gas supplies to the United States of America. The amendment will block any commercial exploration and development in American U.S. coastal waters by the Secretary of the Interior or by any State in the Union with a source of natural gas.  While this provision is necessary in order to preclude USCG offshore development in the offshore portions of the New England production basin, this amendment is not necessary to prevent a sale of U.S. natural gas to the European Union which is expected to increase this demand to the United States. A Senator from New Jersey has said he has concerns about the outcome, but will be willing to work with

difference groups colorado 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the key difference there is that contractors are already covered by Government regulations and penalties. These people pay for their activities and make these huge mistakes to clear the way for their friends and their groups to make use of their services. However, there are still no penalty for getting the wrong people into the wrong buildings and failing to get enough work done to make sure the difference was made. If a company goes through all of that with the very little they pay for the contract to the Federal Government in the first place, the government will get Colorado Springs wrong.  I am supporting my colleagues' amendment and urge them to do so.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If we are going to spend dollars on government, we need to know who is paying for those dollars so that we can correct them when they go wrong. We are not trying to end transparency, but we have to set up requirements that will make the private sector part of the solution rather than the problem. We need to provide disclosure to lenders so we can make sure they are providing adequate funds to every small business in this country.  I also announced on Monday that

This is not a Republican issue.

But even this additional testimony by the administration indicates that the proposed changes to these mandatory voluntary programs are not having the desired impact. In fact, the data collected by the data scientist studies show that even in the majority of drug-free workplaces, drug testing would still result in higher rates of incidents of employee drug use, violence and workplace accidents.  So in the 21st century, the administration is coming to Congress and stating that we need new regulations, we need more enforcement mechanisms for Federal agencies, and we need to spend more time policing the workplace and on

I thank the gentleman from Iowa. Just for a brief question, the gentleman's home State of New Jersey is now the only State in the United States that has an entire legal medical cannabis program within the early phase of a new medical cannabis program that is only on the inpatient part of that program but not at the end or even at the beginning. It is now so under the contract that we have not seen that as any kind of hurting of the program or disenfranchisement of those already involved with it.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

taxpayer court courts 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today is modest in amount, but it is significant in that it would provide a level playing field for all taxpayers in the State of Minnesota who would be eligible for the tax credit of up to $500 if the State had not adopted the alternative minimum tax in 1991 and 1992. The current law does not provide for this treatment for this court-ordered tax credit which is going to expire in 2001. There is no provision in law that would allow courts to extend it.  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that if the tax credit were extended, as originally designed, that it would bring $2 billion in new revenue to the Treasury over the next 10 years. It is small, but it is an incentive to provide fairness for all taxpayers who do not get any tax relief.  It is important for the

Over the next several years, the Small Business Job Creation Act will create over 45 million new jobs for Americans through the reauthorization of our H-2A program, which is a responsible immigration policy that not only helps these employers hire workers but provides necessary direct service through the H-2B, which was lost in last year's spending bill.  In my home State of Ohio, we are home to over half a million businesses that employ more than 40,000 workers.

He can do this in America.

yesterday gingrich leadership 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a historic day. The passage of welfare reform is long overdue. It was a great day for millions of Americans and for the Republican leadership of this Congress. I would like to take this opportunity to call on those on both sides of the aisle to help me finish this bill today.  Yesterday afternoon we heard both sides of the aisle talk about putting the rights of parents back on the table. Republicans believe that the Republican plan to force families to live on welfare should not be passed as a Gingrich vote. They are not interested in compromise and compromise does not work in a debate on welfare reform. The Speaker of the House himself has called for the end of welfare.  The Republican bill ignores the welfare bill, the States rights, and tries to get welfare out of the welfare bill. The States rights bill has been passed

Mr. President, 4 minutes is not a lot of time, but let me just rise today in support of the amendment we have just agreed to to provide the Department of the Interior with the resources to implement the Tribal Self-Determination and Outreach Act of 1996. This important legislation will help people of Indian ancestry successfully navigate the Government in their own communities by providing an opportunity for them to file a separate request to Federal court for the purposes of access to a Dodge-Vazquez self-determination fee.  Tribal governments have long relied on the Department of the Interior to provide them with a mechanism to organize their governments and provide for a sense of community and self-governance. One of the principal needs of Indian self-determination is for localities to know the status of their natural resource resources and the extent of their participation in the

But we are also pleased the Senate has decided to give a fair time to the House side of the equation, a greater consideration of the Republicans' own priorities, and a better understanding of where the Nation is going. That is what we all intend to do, and that is why we have been willing to move ahead with this agreement.  We are also prepared to begin legislative negotiations in the very near future, so we will continue to work with the House side and try to resolve

Mr. President, last November, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. This legislation reforms the current drug pricing and the Nation's system of price controls to allow the market to work more efficiently and effectively. While many of the provisions in this legislation are common sense, the Senate Republicans have put in a new requirement to buy pharmaceutical manufacturers' goods and services from foreign competitors. This provision runs counter to the approach taken by the House and has the unintended consequence of encouraging more foreign imports of our products. I strongly oppose this provision and will vote against final passage.  That is why I have drafted bipartisan legislation that the House has endorsed to eliminate the requirement to buy drugs from foreign companies. This bill recognizes the fact that pharmaceuticals have a critical role in American health care and that foreign competitors need to be forced to pay the bills for purchasing

Airlines seek to reduce their security risks and access to the infrastructure required to implement this essential security technology. Under current law, there are no sanctions on airlines for failing to employ mandatory security measures like death detection systems.  Our amendment seeks to preempt the ban by instructing the GAO to conduct an examination of the airline, the U.S. government, and any other government agency or entity that takes a hard look at the appropriateness of U.S. funds used to implement these mandates.

Mr. President, let me begin by commending Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for their work in crafting and agreeing to the amendment to the Science and Technology Act of 2003 that we are about to consider on this very important matter that will have a significant effect on our economy and on American workers who would be hurt if we were not to make adequate investments in cutting-edge research and development.  Science and Technology Amendments Act of 2003 authorizes the budget for science and technology at the Federal Government through fiscal year 2004. The act would increase the Department's budget by $2.5 billion, reducing its noncommissioned personnel from 180,000 to 140,000.  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Mississippi, Senator Thune, for his vision, persistence and leadership in moving the Science and Technology Authorization Act forward.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for the leadership he has given on this issue. We have a serious problem here in this country that we need to resolve now. As a Republican Speaker, I rise to condemn this action that we are considering here in the House.  What this is about is the price of oil for consumers. This comes about because the United States is not allowing the world market to be competitive as it should be able to be because of the anticipated increases in the prices of gasoline.  It is estimated that by 2020 we are going to be driving Americans back to 70, 85, even 100 miles a gallon of gasoline and no one is going to stand up and say we want the American people to do the same thing.  So what we are talking about here is that we are not going to sit back and do

I thank the gentleman. I would respond simply by saying most indicators are the voters will do it, and what we need to do is come up with a plan to reduce the deficit. It is the Democrats who would never agree to the Democratic budget proposal and the Speaker of the House, the former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who supported the Democrat proposal in the first place and the former Secretary of State William Perry voted against the Republican proposal in the first place because they wanted the Commonwealth of Kentucky to be able to carry this burden that the U.S. Congress has imposed on them. I mean, it was the Chamber of Commerce of the United States that played a big role in raising the debt to zero in the first place. So we need to come up with a plan that will do that. I mean, what is the cost?

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I believe the immediate 30 percent increase is sufficient to pay for the cost of the program.  As we have already heard, the Administration has authorized an additional $6 billion in grants for these programs over the past year and a half. These grants are already paying for significant increases in public health insurance programs and the costs for other health care programs. So it is no surprise that these increases are being used to help fund the program that we are all supportive of and should have all institutions and providers work to keep open and provide needed health care services to their patients.  But, Mr. Chairman, as you said, the administration has not yet authorized any additional funds for the Patients' Bill of Rights Program. I want to stress that this is not a change in the underlying bill,

That will be an important change for him to make in order to get the rules of the Senate corrected to be consistent with the United States Constitution.

This particular OCO unit has a staff of 400 full-time workers. Many are doing absolutely amazing

This part is really much more important than the debate over the actual problem of the citizens who will be hurt and going to be hurt by having our economy slow down so much because of keeping our pipes fixed.  This is really what this bill is about, trying to level the playing field with the rest of the industrialized world and bring down this cost of investment in our water systems. Let's get this right.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, today I rise in opposition to the resolution before us from my colleague from Nevada and chairman of the Senate Science Committee, Senator Murkowski. This resolution would permit our colleagues to cut funding for many scientific research scientists by over $1.5 billion, including some who are critical to the health and well-being of the American people. It would mean that researchers will be forced to cut their funding to key environmental pollutants dioxide, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and sulfur in order to reduce toxic tailpipe emissions at our Nation's airports, which are vital to New England. In fact, the Clean Air Act requires that air pollutants are only permitted as safe pollution controls, unless the source is specifically exempted from being subjected to pollution controls.

Bill Emerson began his political career in the late 19th century as a farmer in Ohio before moving to the South in the early 20th century to work in the fields after the First World War where he met Sunday school teacher and neighbor, Millard Taylor, before settling in San Francisco, and eventually working in the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.  Following an intensive course of study in political science at Stanford University, Bill moved to Los Angeles in 1938 where he found his calling

I love Tom and I have loved him for his many years of service.

The credit markets in the United States are not stable enough.  With respect to the deregulation provision that we passed earlier in the year, the Bank Governors Association wrote an editorial saying it was badly flawed because it did not accomplish its true objectives.

I ask colleague to say that the record indicates that the list of those States that are the first in line is a good list, the areas of greatest need for emergency funding are the first to receive the aid.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, soon the Senate will act on the conference report on the fiscal year 1997 Budget for Medicare and Medicaid Programs. This will be a big step in helping the future generations of Americans to continue to get the care and the benefits they need and deserve to keep them healthy for years to come. It is crucial that the country preserve its strong Medicare and Medicaid programs, and I commend Chairman Biden for his hard work on both issues.  On a health care issue, there is already some good news in the budget. All States have received waivers allowing them to continue improving their Medicare and Medicaid programs, as did the majority of Republicans and Democrats. Two-thirds of States that we have met with in discussions have now agreed to require employers to cover employee health insurance for their workers. This is an important step to strengthen Medicare and Medicaid as

However, if the changes the Senate has already made to the Affordable Care Act are not spread out across all of the offices in the Senate, those changes will only have an impact on workers.

It represents the most serious investment of Federal taxpayers' dollars in public health care in recent years and guarantees low wages paid to salaries at Kaiser Permanente hospitals in California and New Jersey for family physicians and nurses.  It guarantees that Kaiser Cares will make money, too, by reimbursing them for caring for uninsured and low-income people in the rural areas of California, New Jersey, and other parts of this Nation.  The cost of the legislation will be modest. A conference report between the House and Senate will be proposed by the week of September 20. I commend Chairman

What the Democrats' agenda is doing is telling the small business owners and businessowners who are counting on their new government support that they will have no problem expanding to provide jobs and higher wages. But that will not solve the real problem of this economy, which is a huge job-killing tax hike, because the average American's paycheck has only grown by only about 2.6 percent in real terms since 1986.

This legislation would put funding in place to enhance the performance of all Federal response agencies that contain their content into the next surge. This will yield more readily available help to victims of natural disasters that consume more resources.  Of particular note is that States, localities, and private individuals will have the opportunity to determine their FEMA counterparts' needs for resources and to weigh in with their thoughts and proposals for the way they can best meet their jurisdiction's needs.  Madam Speaker, I am pleased that I have this opportunity to speak to these concerns at the beginning of this year. As the Vice President of FEMA, I am now on the verge of deploying the second

This is a unique relationship in which the United States benefits not only from the hard work of its partners around the world but also from universal access to its products and services. As the Nation gains global competitiveness, its health expenditures should increase far more rapidly than revenues. But what if America's competitors--such as Mexico, Japan, and India--learned that there are a lot more innovative ideas and health products and services available there than are available in the United States? That is exactly what has happened. In 2001, the United States and Mexico negotiated a bilateral agreement establishing an exchange program to share foreign-produced health products and

In fact, they are in the pocket of the oil and gas companies, which they once fought to keep out of the tax system.

Over the next 2 years, this bill will build on and strengthen the current housing assistance structure by streamlining and simplifying and streamlining section 8, which provides critical protections to families with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level.  In 2010, Americans who live below the poverty level--such as those who are Latino or working families--will see their unemployment benefit go from 4.2 percent to less than 2 percent. This is a

The bill does not create a new government recordkeeping office. This bill does not give law enforcement a new way to gather information and to share that information that is already recorded in the Federal Records. The bill does not pollute the records with excessive government identification numbers. The bill does not create a Federal law requiring the commission to determine what information in its files is appropriate for investigation.

But the issue we are talking about today is not about food in agriculture; the issue we are talking about today is whether these very modest food programs will go unfunded.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not change our food programs. It simply says, that if those programs are going to survive this year, it should be because we are going to keep our promises, we are going to continue these programs.  It would be better if we had passed a bill providing that relief, but we did not. The status quo has not continued that so long that we have to take a different approach.

The research and the data shows that smoking is the single most harmful thing in our society. Nearly 2 million American children died as a result of smoking in 2005. If tobacco was sold at lower cost on the black market, then a person who would have bought it would have saved $260. Would they have been able to use that money to start a family or to pay for education? No.  Tobacco is the single most socially damaging industry. There are millions of

Another matter that concerns me is the recent audit that was performed on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline which was part of this $4.7 billion energy bill that passed out of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources just today because it was part of this $4 billion that we have been able to increase in the last few days because we have been able to get some very important things done that this Nation that so much of this time seems so concerned that we have not yet come out of this factionalistic bickering and, more importantly, have been able to deliver these many additional benefits that I hope and hope the American people have.

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, thank you to the gentleman. And I would like to say thank you also to my colleague from New York for coming and really working on the issue that our committee on which I serve has been working on for months. I wish to say something that really is a very personal commitment of mine as well. I am proud to have a child of Indian heritage and someone of my own heritage here in this country because of what our experience brings to awareness, to trying to make a difference for those communities.  I first got involved in Indian affairs when I was 19 years old. I thought what I would be doing is joining the Navy, and then I went into law school. It was two years before I was married. I stayed in law school; I actually got married and got out, but it was a young family,

I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from South Carolina to spread the word on this issue and help spread the word to the American people that we are going to have an opportunity to provide a critical earmark for a study on Ebola and other infectious diseases that have occurred in West Africa. And this is one of those vital programs that is very important for the Department of Defense to be at center stage in order to try to control the spread of infectious diseases. And I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Wisconsin to bring this bill forward so that we can make sure that the Department of Defense is at the forefront in this way of trying to control these types of infectious diseases that may have occurred in West Africa.  I yield the floor.  The <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I would like to explain the content and purpose of this amendment, which simply would provide for the establishment of an exchange in the Caribbean as an additional security assistance program for the Caribbean region in support of economic, political and other economic development efforts.  It is my understanding that this exchange would operate under the same existing security and other operations standards as those previously established for such institutions already in operation in other businesses in the Caribbean.   Museum of Modern Art.   L'Oreal.   Disney.   Gumroad.   Jet-Rough Travel.   Members of the Caribbean community are very concerned with the lack of such facilities.

back jobs unnecessary 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, as the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Mr. Gekas and Mr. Clinger, have pointed out, there are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle that have put up this money in the last several years to try to get us to get back some of these jobs out of the country. This is the point that we are making. It seems to me that by doing so we would have some incentive not to reduce unnecessary taxes, which is what we have been doing since this measure was passed, which actually cuts out over $1 billion out of these funds which is over $300 billion a year of interest and all of the other goodies that are being put up for the administration, I mean, it is basically asking them to either run the deficits or cut the spending.  If we do that, then we would be seeing a lot more
