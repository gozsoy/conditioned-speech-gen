However, the President wants to pull back on health care reform by just adding a one-time tax penalty for higher-income individuals.  In 2008, the Bush administration proposed a tax on Social Security and Medicare. But the tax was only supposed to go into effect in 2009. President Obama wants to lift the tax penalty on Americans earning more than $1 million per year and, at the same time, cut spending for Medicare and Medicaid.

Deputy prime minister Dmitri Trenin had reportedly been dismissed after the opposition leader said that he would be replaced in the next round of Presidential elections. Deputy prime minister Dmitri Trenin was accused of unethical conduct for taking his wife, Yulia Yablokova, off the payroll of public television.  Russia and the West both have much to gain by eliminating Mr. Trenin's office. If Mr. Trenin's family and friends are to be effective partners, the U.S.

Under current law, the Federal Government's failure to extend unemployment benefits on a given day is meant to discourage people from leaving work and finding new jobs by creating an unsustainable cycle of joblessness.  When Congress last reauthorized the unemployment insurance program in July 2009, it allowed for a 5-month period in which the government extended these benefits on the designated week of June and July, but had to first sunset them on the dates of November 20 and November

This legislation will also protect the water supply for future generations by addressing the potential for adverse effects on both the local economy and the environment and by protecting the rights of the people and their property.

Madam President, the Senator from Arizona raises another issue that we have not addressed in this bill, and that is the question of whether the government will have to participate in these decisions in the private sector. The President has said that Federal employees will not have to participate. But even if they were, they would not have to participate, because the majority believes the taxpayers of this country will not be provided with information to be sure that they are receiving fair compensation for the services that they give. So, in fact, they are proposing to turn this job-killing proposal into a job-creation proposal in that it will require that private firms must give us information

Mr. President, I have five important reasons why I voted against this amendment. I think this amendment would be a complete waste of time for this body and for the Nation if it were to ever become law. One of these reasons is the history of the 13 years since the 9/11 Commission has said that the old attempt to use the PATRIOT Act to invade and do the unspeakable to search the records of this body was a most arrogant, abusive, and illegal abuse of power. The commission has said that the program to harvest information from the American people was unpatriotic and unconstitutional. It has said that the program was illegal because

It has been several months since the Kennedy facility was commissioned for shipbuilding purposes, and there is no permanent mission there.

Mr. President, in the days before this week's big tax increase on middle-income Americans, some were making the important case for how it could be done through a middle-class tax cut as opposed to more spending and bigger government. Now is the time for more than one middle-class tax cut in this country. They have the force of law now because of this new law that the Senate has passed to put the same number of middle-income Americans at the same level of the State and local tax deduction as the one that was last year.  I am committed to working with my colleagues to get a middle-class tax cut of the kind

Before I go into what these sanctions should cover and how they would work to address the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent tragedy, I would like to discuss one of the most glaring violations of international law in Iran's recent conduct in Iraq.

Madam President, we have before us a very important amendment to help reform our credit card industry, an amendment that I have cosponsored with Senators Bayh, Feinstein, and Casey. It is the second major credit card reform amendment we will consider next week.  Every year we throw all kinds of junk into the credit card system that we all know can put us at great risk. And I think the credit card industry has an awful lot of very good junk in it. We all know we need to get rid of those things that can put the American economy at risk. Yet many credit cards default on their first try without any warning or any explanation

This administration, with its economic emphasis on the private sector, which is by now the predominant source of Federal spending and tax revenues is putting limits on increasing the use of fiscal and efficiency savings to deficit reduction.

Mr. Speaker, this week at the White House the administration did its best to undermine the environment in America by bringing its proposal to the President for approval by Congress. This week we have learned that after 4 years of being totally ignored by the American people this proposal has already been voted on in Congress by the Republicans in 1993 and 1994 and could be voted on by the American people again today if the President is unable to even meet with the public about the plan and thus can't get his legislative agenda done in time for the American people in 1994. This is what the Republicans have been doing over the last year and a half.  This is the same old

Mr. Speaker, as the Speaker of the House in all of this for the past 25 years that I have been here, I have listened to the debate about this balanced budget amendment today. I have also listened to a number of the Members who have spoken to the House on the floor and here in the Chamber about their support for this balanced budget amendment, but I have also heard from the other side of the aisle who will not allow us to consider the issue. This is not about the Clinton proposal, it is about a very simple proposition. This is a call to action for the Congress of the United States of America to bring the Nation into balance by

Mr. Chairman, in my district in southern California, people are seeing increased weather-related illnesses due to pollution from industrial facilities and in high-rise buildings. These adverse health impacts are being experienced by communities like mine in Riverside County.  The residents of my district are suffering from asthma and other illnesses which were caused in large part by these pollutants.  I recently received a letter from Dr. Jim Boeman from the Children's Hospital of Southern California. Dr. Boeman is an ecologist, a public health official, and one of the leading authorities in the field of environmental health. He and his wife Jane recently attended a conference on the environment at

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment, which will provide the balance of our homeland security spending for fiscal year 2004. This increase will be offset by reductions to other domestic spending.  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has not been spending enough to keep pace with the level of modernization needed to keep our ports secure and our Nation's national parks and monuments secure. We have increased spending on nonmilitary defense in the last decade, putting our Nation at greater risk in many areas of the world.  I recently traveled to

<|endoftext|>Public Law 109-43 to extend the deadline for the Government Accountability Office to conduct its audit of the Medicare Program for a year was adopted by the Senate last month without controversy or public debate. Since its introduction, however, the Government Accountability Office has not even begun to do the work it has promised to do when it files its report. Moreover, the agency still has not agreed to release the Medicare program's administration plan to help prevent fraud and abuse and eliminate wasteful spending.  Let me be clear: the Medicare Program for beneficiaries is not for sale. Medicare beneficiaries have a right to know whether or not their savings are going to be spent wisely

I think it is important that we provide adequate funds to the American work force to enable them to gain a safety net that they need to work in this difficult economy of ours.

In its place is a more open economy and more prosperity for all of us.
