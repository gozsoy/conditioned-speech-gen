I can think of no more appropriate time to come to the floor to urge our colleagues to support this resolution than to satisfy the dual purpose that the United States was charged with in the first place and to find a way to deal with the underlying question of what is best for our own interests, because it is for our own

Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of discussion about the growing number of legal immigrants today in this country, not only legal but also illegal. We have had an increase in the number of people in private sector jobs that we have required them to have in order to keep the government going. In order to do this, people in the legal system are working the illegal floor.  The Republicans, in fact, are not only trying to force the legalization of illegal workers, they are also trying to force the legalization of legal workers, but that is not right either. It is shameful to let people in this country have to work legally, to allow them

That is a program which we passed in response to the attempts of several administration officials to use tactics which made it easier for illegal aliens to escape and escape only to be apprehended on the border, where they have been little more than Maine potato chips. But much of that effort was aimed at the unaccompanied children who were particularly susceptible to being crossed into the United States and apprehended by the Border Patrol. It was the best known program of its kind because it

Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues Senator Simon and Senator Graham in introducing legislation that would extend the bipartisan Family and Medical Leave Act of 1994 for a year. I first introduced legislation in the last Congress, and it passed the Senate bill in the last Congress, but it was opposed by the other body, and at that time there were many of us, I believe, who were convinced that this issue was going to be resolved.  We had to focus more attention on this issue because on a much larger scale, my colleagues in the Senate, House, and administration--President Clinton, Senator Simon, Senator McConnell--were all doing very well

Mr. Chairman, we are the first of many. A committee that was created only in 1987 and before the year 2000 still has the committee chairman as its chairman. The committee should not be held up in such a way that the States can not come forward to plan. I regret that the language allows some of those that are already involved in that type of activity not have any exception any longer even though instances have occurred in our committee where the gentleman has such a provision.  We are the first of many. We can't wait another day until we complete this whole process.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

We should not have to use force to combat organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which has been calculated to threaten and destroy the United States and our allies and which we have had the ability to provide intelligence agencies of the United States to gather.  If that fact would dissuade those who are fighting ISIL that the peace and normalization process which this administration has initiated, which we have

Last year I had the opportunity to speak in front of the House Appropriations Committee, this time, the Senate.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1562, the bipartisan Amtrak Service Transition Act of 2005. Congress and the Administration have made our Nation a better place by having Amtrak work with Federal and State transit authorities to build a new Virginia-New Jersey regional rail network. We have now before us a long overdue opportunity to make this happen. This bill before us today simply recesses the statutory deadline for passing legislation to implement a joint rule to become effective.  Mr. Speaker, Amtrak and the local communities and governments that rely on it will continue to put on hold some very costly and problematic projects to fix its aging infrastructure. However

The need for this bill is a personal one for me and a business in Colorado as well as the other session. I have been fighting against a plan which forces small businesses to pay for the existence of the vast number of agencies within our intelligence communities, and for Government to determine who lives or dies for its mission.  This measure would force large companies to pay more for participation in these marketplaces, and small businesses to pay less for them. It is also a proposal that

I have had the opportunity to meet with students from New Life High School as well as Foreign Leaders from the United Nations and other international communities about the subject of global warming and the environment. One of the oil companies I met with last week was ExxonMobil.  I asked them how they had gone about identifying problems with global warming.

Madam Speaker, I think that if people in this room had had more information on this issue of welfare reform before the adoption of this measure, that would have been helpful because we have all seen the children and mothers and children who are these welfare recipients because they simply do not have health care coverage, and it is very difficult.  We are not addressing that, Madam Speaker, and that was not the intention of this resolution.  Madam Speaker, I want to point out that this resolution does not change the President's budget. It does not move the Government into October. It says that this Congress will go through regular order.  <|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, one of the greatest honors of my lifetime has been to serve in the House of Representatives as a United States Senator for the 10 years since 1992. Since recognition of my election to the Senate, I have been a tireless advocate for the quality of life for the vast majority of American citizens. I consider preserving affordable housing as one of my most important goals for the remainder of my term. For me, affordable housing is the answer to our urgent need for clarification and development of housing policies which can bring economic opportunity and security to our citizens.  During the past 18 months, the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity held two hearings on housing policy

This is the Congressional Budget Office. In discussing the deliberations of the conference committee on the House bill on the Budget for fiscal year 1998, the Congressional Budget Office stated: The CBO also points out that the plan we have before the Senate achieves a single major savings, for the purposes of budget resolution purposes.
