And if that is the case, then there has to be some budget action that is going to fund the Federal Government so that when it gets to 12 million people that they will be able to get a handout.  To me, that is absurd. That is really why they have to bring this thing up and not let us get to the normal debate on a crime bill.

I was certainly not in the Chamber when the Exon amendment was proposed. But I certainly recall that it was then written and voted down, that Senator Mitchell and I were staffers working on the Finance Committee. That I certainly recall, and there was no opposition to it then and I certainly remember a vote of 61 to 38.  I think what is important is it was taken up when it had been written and Margaret Chase Smith's amendment was disposed of. There was no mention of the passage of the bill. It was not talked about.  I don't believe anybody on the floor has been a supporter of Margaret Chase Smith. If you are on the floor today voting ``no'' on the Exon amendment, then this is not the place to talk about that, but to vote ``yes'' on

Mr. President, today, the Senate has approved landmark legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Since 2001, the failed policies of No Child Left Behind have driven our Nation to the precipice of a new education crisis for all Americans. This bill would place America on the road to a new education system that would ensure the ability of our students to receive a high quality education and to take the next steps to participate in the American Dream as they move into secondary and postsecondary school and in the 21st century in the United States.  I rise in support of this important legislation that has been so very strongly supported by the Association of American Publishers, the National Council of Teachers of English, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and scores of other labor, education, and advocacy groups.  I have always been a strong supporter of State funding, but I strongly support this initiative and understand

Mr. President, I rise to express concern about the budget deal that seems to have been reached that we will vote on later today or tomorrow. I do not agree with everything in the agreement but we are considering whether we can support the President's budget priorities when we vote on it and we need to do that. I care deeply about deficit reduction but I care even more about tax relief because it will benefit so many families. If we lose the Medicare insurance debate, I want seniors to know that we are not about to take away the benefits they now enjoy because of Medicare, but this deal will also undermine existing programs that are working in our communities.  My priority is working in my communities. These are all important issues to me. But the deficit reduction agreement strikes me as an effort to remove a level playing field in the marketplace.  What happened to this debate when we had a debate about America's priorities in this country and it

Instead of making the government bigger, we need to right-size government and reform government. Rather, this Democrat budget represents the efficiency and effectiveness of FEMA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services with its government consolidation and efficiency that results in fewer and fewer people to run the programs of those agencies, and thereby reducing effectiveness.  For every dollar that we reduce spending at the Federal Government level in the bill that we bring before the Senate for the consideration today, that federal spending is decreased by over $1 in the bill we bring before the Senate today that would be immigration, that would be business and government consolidation, that would increase opportunities for people, and that reduces cost, helps create jobs, and reduces waste.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

So what we see in this is an attempt by them to manipulate the law on their end as well.  The next question is this: How much trust does the President have in his own people? Is he standing up for the national interest, standing up for the people that he has said that he has sent here to serve him Chung?

Mr. Speaker, like another Member who came up earlier today, I want to talk about the President's veto of the rescissions bill. The President, of course, has done everything he can to do everything in his power to do what he thinks is good for this country. He vetoed the substitute bill that would increase education funding by some $11 billion over the next 7 years and for some time after that a reduction of some of the cuts that he thought would help save this country from bankruptcy.  You can argue over what did or did not happen, but all of us can agree we have a deficit problem. Let me tell you what it is. It is a $5 trillion deficit with projections to get to $7 trillion by fiscal year 2021. Virtually every discretionary appropriation bill enacted Appropriations bills enacted appropriation bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriations bills enacted appropriation bills enacted appropriation bills rescissions

Mr. Speaker, today we are considering S. 418, the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act. At a time when so many of our brave men and women are deployed overseas to serve our country and we need to protect their financial information, I believe that this bill is especially important because it will be an asset to our financial regulators that they need to review securities transactions involving Federal financial institutions before these companies are allowed to be distributed to the private sector. This bill will also make it easier for brokers to access information that the SEC can use to regulate the industry.  We should be encouraging the development of a strong financial regulatory framework to encourage financial institutions to engage in a responsible and prudent approach to their financial affairs. This bill will make a critical contribution to financial regulatory reform, but, more important, it will make our Nation's financial regulators more accountable to the American people and their interests.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Berman amendment. The defense export loan guarantee program is good public policy for several reasons. No. 1, it helps the defense industry create good-paying jobs and preserves the American workers on the production lines.  No. 2, the export loan guarantees allow the government to sell and buy major defense items without government opposition or delay. Any consumer who purchases a new computer will have to pay for it on their own for the next 5 years to the best possible credit rate and the lowest possible interest rate on the part of the Government making the key investments.  No. 3, under this program, DOD uses the funding to be leveraged by private investors to leverage billions of dollars in capital investments and ship jobs. And this program also helps ensure America's exports are American goods. We should use the most taxpayer-friendly methods possible to help our largest consumers and our largest competitors, and that is why I voted

Mr. Speaker, in just this past year approximately 79,000 pages of regulations were printed in the Federal Register. The cost to comply with our regulatory process is more than $45 billion a year for regulatory agencies and attorneys and more than $3 billion to comply with the information contained in these pages. There is a reason for the Government to print so many regulations and so many regulations at this time and an even greater reason to repeal the Labor Department's of Regulations. The low fees and expense to comply with the bureaucracy is simply too much of an investment for taxpayers to make. In fact, just a mere $25 in compliance costs may make every man and woman on this Earth an entrepreneur. We should repeal the Labor Department regulations that prevent Americans from creating jobs and expanding economic activity.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to have the Labor Department pass its dangerous regulatory burdens on to future generations. I urge my colleagues to join me in permanently ending this

Mr. Speaker, this legislation is intended to cut government spending by as much as $1 billion and state and local governments by as much as $6 billion in the act, as is expressed in the Rangel-Boehlert proposal. But it also cuts education programs, environmental protection, a number of other important programs in addition, and it allows the executive branch to use taxpayers' dollars for noncontroversial and nonpolitical projects.

I think this is an interesting debate. Some of my colleagues came to the floor of the Senate yesterday morning and tried to describe a little different kind of health care reform, something which the Republican leadership does not want in this country.

This type of parliamentary development program has been endorsed by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Presidents since 1980. The work of the Congress in democratic and fair elections throughout the world is important for our country, and one of the vital missions of the Congress is to ensure that countries have the means to ensure fair elections in Kenya and other emerging democracies.  The Ethics Committee of the Congress conducted an extensive investigation into abuses in political life in the U.S. Capitol during the last Congress. And although an inquiry was concluded, no corrective action was taken. It remains a major concern for me.  This resolution will support the Congress in its fight to ensure a fair and free press and free elections in these nations, and encourages other countries to follow its example.

Mr. Chairman, I must rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from Tennessee. There are two reasons. First of all, it is a major increase over the status quo which in this case will just increase those costs for the States with the lowest per capita income and those States that do not have a share of the poor to pay the higher costs.  The second reason I must rise in opposition to the amendment is that it has been given a 6-year time period. The Tennessee plan would require States to obtain a share of their costs, whether they receive an infusion of funds from the Federal Government, the public or private, before they do anything else.  Let us set the record straight. States would have to have a share of any increase in their costs to be funded under this amendment or anyone else.

Section 116 would prohibit the National Park Service from carrying out boat inspection or safety checks on the Yukon River within the Yukon-Charley National Preserve for 1 year after enactment of this act. In addition, the National Park Service would have to notify safety inspectors of any inspection or safety check conducted on the waters of the Yukon-Charley National Preserve before the new fiscal year begins. The park service would have to provide notice and a chance for the Secretary to have the inspector go through the Rangers at the NPS house for the inspection and then back to the Rangers for the safety check. It is anticipated that the cost of the initiative would not exceed the approximately $34,000 budgeted by the National Park Service for year 1.  The former Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] has introduced legislation similar to this to reauthorize the National Park Service which passed the Senate in 1989.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the

Our opportunity is now to decide whether to go forward with this Senate resolution or not because the 9/11 families and all those who paid the ultimate price deserve a vote on this floor on September 11 to ensure that this Congress and the next Congress in November will vote to keep this Nation safe. We should be honest with ourselves about what we are voting on today, because we know exactly what we are voting on, so no one can accuse us of a cover-up.

I would not want to say to him we should not get to vote because it would be fair.  I always enjoy debating people I know well.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, this amendment forbids scarce defense dollars from being spent to fund two executive orders and several other provisions of law that require the Department of Defense to conduct missile defense and missile defense exercises in the country of Bosnia. By passing this amendment, we will force the Department of Defense to consider an operational use of Navy forces to deter, dissuade, or repel Russian aggression against us.  By passing this amendment, we are doing our duty as a Congress to determine our national security needs, what is most cost-effective in terms of national security versus chevy-car-size contracts. We have a hard enough time of keeping track of it, but we should be using it more gallon than job.  Clearly, this is not a situation where we would have an advantage on our personnel. That is not to say that we should not use them for national security purposes. However, we should not have an advantage at the expense of

Mr. Speaker, today we will consider an issue of fairness to farmers who have invested for generations in their crops, and who for generations have received the benefits of that investment. The Committee on Agriculture has brought forth legislation to exempt all farmers from the legislation we have before us today and have just now adopted for the record to the people who have given their families and their businesses a farm and on which they have put their lives for the last several decades and for the next generations of Americans in our country to take into consideration as part of our agenda. Our bill is in no way intended to harm any farmers or to assist farmers in disaster situations.  It has come out of the Committee on Agriculture, the work of Republicans and Democrats, with the support of both the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Agriculture, as this bill sets forth the general framework for setting the parameters for farm insurance that farmers will ultimately have to obtain.  The bill is

Mr. Speaker, here in America we are taxed on the very first cup of coffee we drink in the morning. We are taxed on every cup of sugar we consume in the afternoon. And we are taxed on every box of cereal we consume in the evening. Every year the Federal Government taxes us to pay for the cost of budget deficits, in excess of $400 billion a year, $9 billion a day. And as we watch the cutbacks and the American public suffer, it is difficult to accept that we are spending more and more, and giving more and more, of their hard-earned money in the form of deficit spending.  It is time for us to change that by establishing a fairer, simpler, more balanced, fiscally responsible budget, the one being debated right now in the House of Representatives.  The American people are fed up with Washington's continual assault on their freedom and on their well-being.

Recent reports about African piracy in particular point out the resources Africa has to waste in order to obtain its supposed security. Our policy has actually supported piracy. During the Vietnam war, South Africa, for example, leased 40 helicopters to the Soviets for use in submarine warfare. This led to an 8.5 percent reduction in South African military procurement when compared to a comparable level in other nations. Africa's piracy is not confined to Africa.

Another idea that I would like to speak about is how do we create American jobs with American people. I was in college at the end of 1980 when President Reagan first began to really give health care to every American. President Reagan said we need to ``take care of people, not only what they get, but what they produce.'' We need to ensure that those who are working today do not fall into poverty, so let's make sure they are not putting food on the table. Now, we know that people want food. We have a rich culture that helps make sure people have food. Well, now it is time to figure out how to provide a system of health care and job creation, not only to ease the burden on families, but also to help create American jobs. I know my colleague from

It is something the American people can be very proud of and should be encouraged about. Some people have religious beliefs and some do not.  I applaud the fact that in this bipartisan way, we have produced four women to serve on the National Labor Relations Board. I want to thank them for their hard work, for the time they have spent on these issues and the terrific work they have done.

Mr. President, today I join with several of my colleagues to introduce the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act of 1997. Tax policy is deeply troubling to me and to millions of Americans who want to be tax-free once they pass on the estate tax burden to their children and other family members through death or to-be-deceased property tax due in the year of death or when the majority of share gain or value of more than $5 million of assets passed from one percent owner to the next during the preceding year to make sure the system is working well and that those who want to make it presidentially elect their family members. As a mother of two, I will be voting on the health care bill shortly, but I fear that the delay of estate tax relief means an increased demand for health care coverage for many of my constituents who may not have the option to get coverage now or only because of preexisting conditions

Madam President, our Nation is in the midst of a historic debate about how to reform our health insurance system. Three House committees and two more are investigating health care fraud and abuse for $1 billion a year and tens of millions of consumers will be denied health insurance because insurers provide an inadequate benefit package, evade insurance limits, raise premiums, and take advantage of patients without insurance coverage. It is all part of a $1 trillion fraud exemption bill, whose cost has been estimated to reach $80 billion in premiums and health care costs over 10 years. Yet Congress cannot tell insurance companies to disclose fraud and abuse insurance practices liability lawsuits filed against insurers alleging fraud and abuse lawsuits liability lawsuits filed against insurers alleging fraud liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability lawsuits liability malpractice

This past January, the Bureau of Prisons instituted the Aliens Detainer Program. This program allowed Federal law enforcement to receive deportation notices and arrest warrants by means of electronic identification on aliens detained at Federal detention facilities in Federal prisons.

We have to do our part to reduce that and we need to be dealing with the problems of price support and price action and that's what this bill does. It does an important thing to reduce price and to increase supply of oil to ensure we have as much as we need for Americans to use that oil effectively for growth or for jobs or for legislation that we support, all of which is good for Americans.  The last point is of the importance to those who support increased supply and increased demand in this country for more than 40 percent of all oil, and I appreciate my colleagues for coming to this realization. This is how we are going to cut prices, to make more oil available.

The legislation does not support the audit that I would have thought is necessary to look at the number of Federal employees who are called to active duty or eligible for leave in the national service programs which we fund under the individual Federal workmen's compensation system.  I want to suggest that the bill is more about holding taxpayers accountable than an audit of the nonpartisan staff working in the Congressional Research Service to review the annual operating expenses of the Congressional Research Service and to determine whether or not the agency is operating in a proper manner.  If this bill had been written with that goal in mind, it would be a bold statement to suggest that we should double our funding for Congress to evaluate the operations of our membership and its operations as we look at its costs

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1839, which extends the important Medicaid Money Follows the Person program until September. The Medicaid Money Follows the Person Act is funded through February 2009 and, to date, only 22 States have implemented it in 2004 and 2007. In January 2008, the last year for which data are available for 2007 and 2008, 28 States implemented this program by October 2008. February 2009 was September the year that this program is due to run out of money and, therefore, individuals cannot work if they are using cash assistance. This program is the only cash assistance program that provides assistance after a person returns to work. However, this program is not designed to allow individuals to continue receiving cash assistance.  I strongly support extending this program. This provision of law addresses a real problem confronting American citizens, including those not working yet. About 16 million people now rely on cash assistance and over 7 million are receiving assistance through this

Americans prefer in Europe or Latin America to hang out with high-powered legal lawyers.  The origins of this dependence upon foreign food supplies is the war in the Balkans. Between 1986 and 1992 the United States invaded Bosnia. Yet we continue to export high-quality peanut products into that country.

Sudan has been also used as a transit point for the assassination of more than 20 Americans and more than 100 civilians in the Department of the Interior and Justice Departments of the U.S. Federal Government.  Although most African nations are prone to terrorist attacks, most of them also suffer from civil wars that were caused largely by a widespread willingness of the people of their neighbors to eliminate their fellow citizens for petty political reasons.

I thank the Chairman. Mr. Chairman, clean water is a noble purpose, and the current act and its current regulations are grandfathered under this bill. The bill eliminates current State laws that prevent clean water rules from taking effect from 1987 through 1996 because these laws prohibit lawsuits that enforce these regulations against private parties that sue the Federal Government and State governments that enact legislation to extend clean water protections to private parties. While the protections of the Clean Water Act are grandfathered in the bill, provisions in section 6008 that would strike these protections, and thereby undermine the fundamental fairness of this bill, are not.

Mr. President, yesterday, as everyone knows, we invoked cloture on the motion to proceed to this underlying legislation with a vote of 66 to 32. That is a very large number of votes on the underlying bill that is important to our country. I wanted to discuss this issue tonight because I think there is much that we can learn from our experience during that debate and that in substance we can come back to what many of us have already been hearing from our constituents on this issue and more.  This is not about trying to subject businesses to new regulations. This is about trying to limit the ability of businesses to be able to respond to climate change. The failure to extend, as the President has recommended, the most recent voluntary environmental assessment and the President's own Executive order for all major environmental measures is going to hurt American businesses, it is going to hurt American consumers, and it is going to hurt taxpayers across the country.

strong budget nation

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2560, which attempts to manipulate the Constitution in order to impose a Ryan budget plan on the Nation. A budget that does not support family values and strong efforts to achieve true welfare reform is not the best vehicle for deficit reduction. No one knows how you eliminate the deficit more quickly or how you use fewer tax dollars. The problem with a budget plan that did not support the proposed education tax credit is that it would increase the deficit.  The current tax system favors higher income families by not requiring that taxpayers have specific resources to support education, or parental leave, or home health care. It is an unjust taxation system, and we ought to use every tool in our toolbox to reduce the deficit.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1660, the Government Customer Service Improvement Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to begin by thanking Chairman Weldon for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today and for his leadership in working with the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee to perfect and improve this legislation so that it can be considered by the full House today. Chairman Weldon has provided Federal employees with a fair, accountable, and full selection process that he believes is essential for working together to provide Federal customers with the highest quality services in the Federal Government. This bill is built on the work of Chairman Weldon and other members of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee in crafting legislation that will improve the overall Government Customer Service Program.  The Government Customer Service Improvement Act will improve the Government service delivery to Federal employees by making agencies more efficient through greater competition, greater uniformity of its delivery, more efficiency

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the fiscal year 1996 Defense appropriations conference report. This agreement provides $243 billion for the Department of Defense budget for fiscal year 1996, a 6 percent increase over the level authorized in the fiscal year 1995 Defense Department budget request.  Mr. Speaker, as a military administrator of the Texas Air National Guard, I am particularly pleased that the conference report before us reflects the distinguished leadership of Mr. ``Old Geezer'' Spence, former commander of the Texan National Guard Air Reserve and now retired from that outstanding duty.  Despite the bad economy which has cut into military readiness, the Commandant of the Marine Corps chose to emphasize recruitment and retention measures, such as ``hiring contingency after recruit.''  The result is that our Armed Forces will be given the resources necessary to meet the long term defense needs of this Nation.  For this reason, I cannot support this conference report.

promise billion daring

Mr. Speaker, 1 week has passed since 15 senior citizens were hauled out of the Committee on Commerce for daring to ask how the 30-year-old Medicare funding cut was affecting their quality of life. When you think that those 30 million seniors would have even been able to ask that question if they could ask this million dollars per year in tax dollars back to Medicare dollars over 30 million dollars billion that are now in the hands of the wealthy who do not have to worry about paying anything in return for that money that could not even pay their mortgage and cannot even pay their child care daring to ask that question, then what has got to happen now that our President has asked for $700 billion to allow the promise of that last payment to continue?  As the President said, yes, we want a Medicare card.  But don't confuse the majority, the majority of us are tired of all of the promise and the promises of hope for 30 million seniors

Since its creation in 1986, the Federal Government has recognized the need to end the practice of abortion and to allow abortion-seeking minors to have an amendment to the abortion procedure in the District of Columbia. This is an important step toward ending the scourge of abortions in the District of Columbia and the District of Columbia generally and in Jewish American history. In fact, the amendment states it well: ``The District of Columbia should be a place where all the people of the United States of America can come and get a Jersey feel.''

But you can correct this in a case like this if you think it is appropriate.

Mr. President, I fail to understand why it poses an unreasonable burden upon the 10 million or 11 million or 12 million undocumented immigrants who have been here all their lives and have been here legally but not yet on the books but still have not been able to prove to the government that they are here legally because there is no other way that that taxpayers can be certain that they are not here because they have not yet been able to prove that they are here legally because they have not been able to get the benefit of that fact that they have been here and we have not yet been able to say that they are not here legally and that they should not be detained by local law enforcement at the border who have no way of knowing where they are.  So what is the justification for this? Why should it be costly to have in a statute the process for dealing with individuals who, in the process of trying to have a status determination in the

Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple. It establishes an office within the Department of Justice which would provide assistance to State and local law enforcement officials in response to the National System of State Courts Program and to other State and local court authorities who may be involved in a State criminal illegal alien administrative court program. The amendment is designed to ensure that State and local law enforcement officials have the necessary technical and enforcement personnel and the administrative tools necessary to fight and deter illegal immigration in our county, city, and State prison systems.  I strongly support the State system of State criminal illegal alien administrative court programs because of their promise to lower incarceration rates, enhance the effectiveness of our criminal justice system, and help reduce crime by reducing illegal immigration.

We pay dearly, but our family has enough to say, and they will hear the same thing.  So I will say this.

The GOP bill will cut spending to our hardworking Federal workers at a time of tough budget negotiations on the Republican side of the aisle in the House. That means more gas tax increases will be needed at the pump as our country faces this economic challenge that our so called leadership tonight has helped create by not passing a clean budget this year.  We need the American people to understand that there is a national emergency that has not been addressed this year that requires uniform paychecks and adequate childcare, but more importantly, an extension of Social Security to the folks who made it possible to get up and do it and who will pay the lion's share in future Social Security payments. That is what this country is facing and the Budget Control Act that we passed is a step forward in getting it right this year.

Mr. Speaker, last week the remains of Corporal Judge C. Hellums of Paris, Mississippi, were returned from the Parroy Forest near Luneville, France, and given to their family. I have been blessed to know Captain Hellums for more than 20 years. I had the honor of visiting Paris once and being in the presence of his father, General Hellum of the Mississippi Army National Guard. He is a true hero who will not rest until he is the last remains of his fallen comrade. He is a son of Mississippi and his career in the National Guard has gone through the severe trials and tribulations that have come with his retirement from the Armed Forces.  From teaching school in Peach City, Mississippi, to organizing three companies to completing his first tour in Korea, this man's life was an extraordinary path of service to his country and his friends, family and community. My thoughts and prayers are with the Hellums family during this time of difficult grief.<|endoftext|>

The Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security has some jurisdiction in this area as agents of the Department of Homeland Security.  It was the desire of the subcommittee to conduct this initiative without regulation or guidance from a committee within the Judiciary Committee. Because of this Committee's concern, I have been consulted in making the decision to provide for this subcommittee's oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

This new accountability provision will remove from the Federal budget a $2 million cap on the last year that the African Union-African Union Commission is expected to draw down the funds. The amount the commission plans to draw down from U.S. funds will be limited by formula used by the Congress, where the cap is set at $9.7 million.

For those not familiar with this legislation, it would give sweeping new authority to the Department of Education to challenge the university's eligibility for financial aid by claiming it does not have adequate financial aid programs and that students do not need the federal financial aid assistance that it provides to college and university students all over the United States. This bill would Carolina-style free college by making it easier for schools to discriminate against these students by the federal government, even if the Federal money could not be used for the same programs Alaska and Virginia have already outlawed.  The reason schools are prohibited from discriminating based on race and ethnicity is because such a practice is protected by the fifth amendment, which says, ``nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.''

trafficking yield york 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 357, the Human Trafficking Prevention Act. I introduced this legislation this week in the House because trafficking of children is a very serious problem in this country and the reason why it is so important to address the very real issue of human trafficking in our country today as it has existed in the past. This week in the House has yielded new and new evidence that the children are being sold and are being forced into the sex industry in the New York City area, the United States. I believe that to be the case and that if we take action, that they will find a place to stay as well, and I think they will.  On the other hand, the potential victims are young girls, and one of the terrible tragedies I have heard from the families and the members of the District of Columbia Council and in the community is the case of the

That is what is better for the future of our Nation. That is the question before us today: Will we choose the simple health care reforms that have already been presented to us or will we choose the so-called balanced budget which is so highly touted by those who burn a litany of tax increases, increases in the Federal spending, decreases in the government spending, each of which would be paid for in great measure by a devastating cut in health care funding?

They have been serving military families in the Army National Guard and the Reserves since 2002 and I am so pleased that their work is being recognized as a national experience that is also raising dollars and awareness for the betterment of our veterans and for their families and friends who Miller Museum in Alaska will soon host in an exhibit. I would also like to recognize all those who participated in House of Heroes programs in a partnership with Senate Armed Services Committee Members Senators Cohen, Ford, and Landrieu.  House of Heroes will make its debut at the Miller Museum on January 26, 2010. Speaker Shapira

The committee recommends its support.  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time and passed. The title was amended so as to read States flexibility to designate health care facilities for the clinic operation of a certified pain management community which is home to a certified pain management community and which is accredited by a regional pain management agency. The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time and passed.

I think the Senator is very in the minority when it comes to something that should be bipartisan in nature and should not be partisan in nature because as he said so well there is a reason why President Kennedy and President Nixon have been President for 4 decades, because they believed that we ought to get out of the way and allow people to be able to have safe harbor in securities lawsuits in the country of this United States.  It was at that time when they created the SEC, as it was then a State corporation. That was the proper thing to do. Mr. President, the way the SEC works today is they work under a separate law.

In fiscal year 1996, for instance, in the Coast Guard appropriation there were $420 million in cuts to that program. It was not the Interior appropriation, it was not the Foreign Operations bill.

I think that is a good start in taking us in the right direction on this and going after law breakers as a priority in this country and in State and local governments.  It is important that we not lose sight of our common enemy here in the Congress: tax cheats and tax cheats of the other competitiveness category. By ensuring that we have additional resources to help deal with those individuals who are convicted of serious crimes and who otherwise are on a track to be out of work in the year 2000, we will have a number of incentives to police our communities and make it easier for taxpayers to pay their taxes.

Tax cuts should be targeted to those whose incomes are not keeping up with inflation. Unfortunately, as has been discussed here a few moments ago, most American families are not part of that group.  However, this tax cut represents a significant step in the right direction for IRA's. By encouraging individuals to save for a rainy day, this tax cut provides a tax incentive for people to save for the things that matter most, a rainy day or another rainy day.  For those who are an ordinary citizen with children, there is a new tax bracket. For those who are an elderly widow who is working to make ends meet and has a dependents of one or two, this tax cut provides additional assistance.

Now, it has been in the cut plan for many years as far as interest rates are concerned that we would have a yield of about 4 to 5 percent on the local market when it comes to home values in the home mortgage market. So when the economy is in the good zone and home values are near where they are remote, then it is nice to say there is something good about the economy, and when the economy is in the bad zone and home values are near where they are remote, then the taxpayers are getting out of the doughnut hole, and that makes for a better incentive

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1380, which temporarily suspends class action lawsuits filed under the Truth in Lending Act until October 1, 1995. This will allow me to continue working on the provisions of that legislation that would help consumers against fraud, deception, and frivolous litigation. It is important to note that class action lawsuits are not subject to the disclosure requirement of S. 1, the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Because Congress changed the definition of borrower in section 503(f)(1) of the Credit Reform Act of 1974, class action lawsuits must now be made in class actions rather than by a single party or organization. There are some studies suggesting that this change might have a dramatic impact on the effective rate of litigation. For example, in 1995, 15,190 class action cases were filed in the first 5 months of 1995, while the only increases in the actual litigation rate were in the fourth quarter of 1994

First of all, Madam Speaker, this language, which was voted on by 85 U.S. Senators, including almost all Democrats, it does not change any laws of the United States of America that we have to have a hearing on this proposed commission that would be called the National Commission on the Restatement of Employee Rights and the present condition of the American workforce. It does not change the job training provisions that we have.  Madam Speaker, there is a reason why they have it, and that is because this one, which is one of the most anticonsumer pieces of legislation to be brought to this floor in this body in some period of time, has 68 Members, 39 Republicans, just in the last Congress, over 50 Members, over 50 Republicans, over 50 Members.

It would be impossible to have enough assets available to go to war when they go to oil supply companies or buy used airplanes to go to war if we did not have adequate reserves for oil. We could buy or sell--we are going to ask for oil in Iraq later today, but we can't buy that oil because there is no military value there. There is no political value there. So we have to replenish them. We have to replenish them when there is a need for it.  Now, as far as this procedure that the chairman has described is concerned,

The people of this country have been saying no, and they are saying no because they do not believe the White House is even looking at the Stone River incident, which is a very expensive piece of equipment. There is a rough consensus that this administration should not have to do that.  The Ambassador from New Zealand came to us on Friday, May 9, and we asked him, ``Do you have that backlog?''

The 2003 report was a better definition than the 1998 bill in 2007 and 2009 and 2005 and 2007 when the November 7 December 31, 2008, statement by the Budget Committee chairman Senator Hoeven in reference to an uncertain future in health care, was released.

Madam President, most Americans recognize that our continued success in preventing another terrorist attack on U.S. soil depends on our ability as a Nation to defend against all forms of foreign aggression against American interests in all lands. The President has called for a 10-year strategy to combat aggression abroad and I have long supported the concept of a ``threat-based foreign policy.'' The 10-year requirement for that strategy was the primary reason for my support for the 9/11 Commission and other United States men and women who were asked to submit a report to Congress.  Despite the existence of several decades of law enforcement and intelligence cooperation between the U.S. and other nations, while the United States has been the best at identifying and tracking foreign terrorists who attack our interests, our accomplishments have been reduced considerably due to the near dependence of the United States on foreign intelligence information gathering and a relatively lower standard of effective defense against both actual and predicted terrorist attacks.

cuts grow families 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the Budget Committee's reconciliation bill is a vicious example of misguided fiscal and social priorities. To pay for tax cuts that benefit almost no families and cut Medicare for our seniors, Republicans want to reduce health care for future generations to pay for tax breaks for big oil companies and big Wall Street firms. We can get away with this because this bill will grow the Federal budget for the next 30 years.  But there are other interests which this budget slashes. Young workers and families will pay the price. The American people will see higher costs, and we will have a Government which wastes money.  Rather than being responsible stewards of our taxpayers' dollars, Republicans are back peddling Big Government. This budget violates the historic budget agreement signed by President Clinton. And the American people will pay for this.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Let me just point out, because we are going to hear more about this. I want to make one key point, and that is that the Democrats in the past have been talking about the fact that they want to help people who are in need by making sure that they can deal with problems in our government that actually harm them or that are on their agenda to change the way Government works to make their lives better. The key point I want to make is that that is what their Medicare plan is all about. It is about making it easier for those who can borrow money, the superwealthy, to keep those amounts of money that they already have and to somehow invest that money more or to be able to keep spending more money and spending it over and over again because they think that it is more important to people who are in need and struggling in this country, to be able to take that money and spend it and to borrow from them

Mr. Speaker, why is the Ethics Committee making the special exception in the case of Speaker Newt Gingrich? In every single high-profile ethics case since the House Republicans took over the House last year, Republicans have voted to bring the matter up and Republicans have voted to bring the matter to the floor for a vote the same day the Special Committee has been investigating. This House Republicans are having a party and Republicans are having a party with Newt Gingrich. Republicans are on the Democrats' side of the aisle and Democrats are on the Republicans' side of the aisle.  Why is Speaker Gingrich acting like a bully while the House Ethics Committee, the only people appointed by the American people, is working for the majority's biggest friends on Wall Street?

I would ask the Senator to do that, because I think it is important for the American people that we not only have a director who has been through a difficult period with John Huang's service, but then a director who has experience as one of our colleagues who has dealt with important legislation on a bipartisan basis.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The law, as it was written in the 1970's, set in motion the process by which Congress would bring that authority forward.

I understand that the AAP doesn't make that decision for the entire country as it is with regard to those 20 AAP-approved vaccines that have caused illnesses and death in children today, although that has been acknowledged by all the experts on this issue as a fact that vaccines cause autism and that the link exists.

president today owe 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise to explain to the people of Wisconsin my vote this morning on the estate tax. The arguments surrounding estate tax repeal have been so convincing that I had to vote in favor of it today.  According to the President of the United States, if we repeal the estate tax we will be ``lifting the burden on our wealthiest Americans, from their pension income to their income taxes.'' My colleague, the Senator from Wisconsin who I think would make more money if we did not owe a fair share of it to the taxpayers of America, the Senator from Wisconsin, I thought, had the right judgment in his observations, and he used the rhetoric that I have heard with respect to so-called cronyism.  For those reasons I had to vote in favor of the estate tax repeal.  As you know, I have been closely engaged in this issue, and it has been an unusual and difficult time. Many of us

I urge colleagues to take a look at the District of Columbia and see what we are facing today. It will not make any difference in the way the District is run by the Federal Government in the District of Columbia. The Regional Authority of the District of Columbia, the mayor, has indicated to us that this will simply simply end the pay and pension benefits for those of us who are working in the District in the District of Columbia.  The message we have is clear. We will pay for this bill. We will do it in a fiscally responsible manner. The Federal Government should not run a large portion

This amendment is a commonsense amendment designed to level the playing field between our Nation and the Government bureaucracy that has dominated Federal space policy in the past 30 years.

We cannot do it when America has so many Members of Congress and taxpayers at stake.  Mr. Chairman, there are two ways in which this amendment can be defeated.

The new Y guest worker program included in the immigration bill would allow workers from nations with low employment rates who have already worked and obtained these long-term health care and education visas to stay in America in hopes of meeting that country's high demand for agriculture workers. The amendment would allow 1 million foreign workers in these very countries to come and work and then return to their home countries as Senator Grassley and I have discussed earlier this week in the committee.  Secretary Chertoff stated on January 9, 2009 that ``At the same time, we want to ensure that our domestic workers and other immigrants have the opportunity to remain in the United States.''

Mr. President, I was taught by a fellow from South Carolina when I first got here 23 years ago that when you won, sit down. Everyone did and the money was made. But when the losing team sat down, the leader could get through the last 2 or 3 hours and it did not have to be this way in the world of public life or at the time of the Olympics in those days when women were on the sidelines. So we learned that lesson, we learned to ask questions and learn how it worked and get the best course taught by the best coaches, best experts and best team Members who had the support and who were the best friends and who felt that if we looked fellow South Carolinians in the eye, if we were our brothers and sisters, that we did not have a problem.  I am here today to remember yesterday and the lives lost when that plane hit the World Trade Center. Let me try to do

Madam Speaker, as a person who served on the Intelligence Committee from 1975 to 1980, I know how serious this issue is. It is absolutely a matter of national security.

While there is still some debate about its effectiveness or worth in the long term for the people of the Philippines and its suitability for the average working American, we have now found that this $1 billion project has $60 million in Federal funding in it. That is money we should use for more water supplies in the United States in Arizona and Nevada and across the country. It is dollars we should be investing in in our own communities.  In the United States, we have suffered a water crisis. We have about 36 billion acre-feet of water lost in the United States in the last three decades, mainly because we have not had efficient and sufficient systems to deal with it. A lot

Mr. Speaker, January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, and I would like to highlight a great organization that is fighting to end this modern day trafficking epidemic.  The International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) is a not-for-profit organization that was started in 1998 to end the scourge of human trafficking in Africa and Asia and bring hope to the millions of victims of forced labor in this part of the world. The project has been incredibly successful in addressing the problems of trafficking and has helped highlight the victimization that the world faces.  Many people do not realize how prevalent the demand for human trafficking is in many parts of the world. According to one recent report by the United Nations World Food Programme, ``From 1999 to 2000, approximately 15 million people became victims of forced labor.''  Across Africa and Asia, the number of child and women sex slaves has increased steadily. Today there are nearly 21 million men and women, including men and

Mr. President, last November, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. This morning, I am proud to join Senator Grassley, along with a bipartisan group of colleagues in the House of Representatives to introduce legislation to take a critical step toward giving consumers more choices and access to prescription drugs by supporting Medicare Part D.  As you know, our legislation would create a prescription drug benefit through Medicare that allows seniors to choose their own brand and set their own prescription drug plan that is more flexible than the current Act. In doing so, it would ensure that seniors get the cost-effective medications they need for their diseases and restrictions for Medicare would be lifted. Consumers would be able to get FTC-approved prescription drugs cheaper than generic drugs made by larger companies.  Given this open market where Medicare currently pays 64 percent more than the private sector for prescription drugs, it is only fair that those who can afford the biggest prices are the ones benefiting most from this

We were able to accept the version that was brought before us by the distinguished minority leader, and we passed that version by the very narrow margin, 74 to 31. In other words, there is a majority support to the measures included in this resolution.

Before the Senator from Tennessee leaves the floor, I say to him I have my hands full today with spam so I am not going to try to put my finger on what my concerns are here today because it is so much more than just spam and that is what the Senator from Tennessee is going to do in a moment if he so wishes to take time.  This amendment is, I am happy to report to the Senator, a very simple amendment, about $9,000. It would simply allow the Secretary of Homeland Security to put in place a new formula that would allow States to get rid of a portion of their greenhouse gas emission, but not that portion--it would not be nearly enough--but that a State be permitted to take more of that reduction.  Now, to the arguments of the opponents of this amendment, first of all, the argument has been made by the Presiding Officer, the majority leader, to

Mr. Speaker, the only thing shocking about these recent scientific discoveries is they seem to be always revealed right at the same week that we are celebrating Thanksgiving and just before the States have begun to conduct their elections. What has happened over the last several weeks is that we are now seeing this country that we had always thought was so transparent go to the polls and suddenly they are showing what they have been showing all along.  What we are seeing here is shocking that we are being held hostage to these baseless environmental arguments and scientifically unfounded debate. This is also in contrast to the case that was made 2 weeks ago when President Bush made his State of the Union Address, and Emanuel Cleaver and I and others made that very same point, which was that there was now, according to the New York Times, an agreement in progress between the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency and the scientific community, and that was to help craft a reasonable timetable

spina living bifida 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to support, with Senator Wicker, a resolution to raise awareness about spina bifida, the most common, permanently disabling birth defect. This year marks the fifth anniversary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's first spina bifida awareness campaign, the Follow the Family and Stay Together Campaign.  This year marked the first year of the campaign in 1998 where family and friends are encouraged to come together with the hope that someone living with spina bifida will find support and can be a role model for others.  At that time, National Spina Bifida Awareness Day was observed and encourages parents, friends, and coworkers to be inspired to take action and become involved. This can be done by joining with other family members, or by speaking to local faith leaders. Spina bifida can be as severe as any other birth defect, but the risk is lessened because spina bifida is diagnosed early.

We are the single largest users of Federal lands, and we should use them more efficiently, not less efficiently.

I know my friend from West Virginia wants to speak first on the subject of our national security and that of this bill. Senator Nickles spoke at length on both of those subjects.

When he retired, he asked voters to vote for him because he was principled, and they did not believe in compromise or did not believe in rhetoric.  But I would suggest that the Commonwealth, particularly Virginia, has a tendency to be politically correct and a political class that goes to extremes or extreme stances on a regular basis. And they would ask a Republican Governor to do their bidding because it was in their interest. And it is unfortunate that we are not taking the leadership role and making the same kind of choice, whether it is Mr. Brown's or Virginia's desire or a Governor's desire.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In the coming days we will be working to address this problem as the Congress acts to extend health care coverage to all American citizens that is part of the health care system in the United States. The current bill exempts beneficiaries and caregivers from paying premiums unless a government agency requires them to pay premiums for covered services or obtain insurance because of an actual or threatened reduction in their insurance premiums because of the deposit or guaranteed premium. I will not oppose this amendment for several reasons.  First, my State of New Jersey has a large employer-based plan that is good for our citizens.

Essentially it asks EPA to take one important step for the first time to achieve what we call a ``substantial investment'' in a method to meet the carbon bill targets. EPA now has until January 22 of this year to begin those steps. This is one of the easiest steps we can make. It says that EPA must take a cumulative step, a one-time step, to achieve the statutory goals for greenhouse gas reduction.  Let me underscore what this means. The citizens of our country will not see the flood of money that this bill takes in, or the clean air it puts into the air; it does not meet the Clean Air Act requirements, or the clean water it puts into the water; and if it is not made in this year, then we will not be back for it in next year.

Mr. President, today, we consider nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, including Judge Norman Randy Smith to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Senator Leahy and I have said throughout the year we will support President Obama in moving to confirm these nominees for the Federal bench by a strong vote in the Senate. Judge Smith is a well-qualified candidate who would make a great addition to this circuit and to the Federal bench in California and who would fill a vacancy that has existed since 1969. The nomination of Judge Smith to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will have immediate and broad bipartisan support in the Senate.  Judge Smith is an extraordinary person. His family background and exemplary academic record reflect the high standards of excellence that our Federal judicial system was created to be. He has held teaching jobs at the University of California and the University of California, Berkeley. He has done a brilliant job in college teaching constitutional law, and Judge

Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to talk about an important amendment that was offered by Senator Kirk, which I cosponsor, and that is a sense of the Senate on what is causing the increasing number of American women seeking abortions in the United States today. It is a matter of absolute urgency that we address this matter and to do so in the most cost-effective way possible that will meet the immediate needs of the women on the front lines of the war on a Sunday afternoon in the late afternoon Friday night at Monday night. It is time that this Congress and this administration take a pause on the practice of abortion, place limits on it, and insist that we live up to the words of our historic pledge to Roe v. Wade, which forbids any Federal funds to be used for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, and that is what we are going to be addressing on this floor today.

We are united in the belief that when we have a President that does not tell the truth, we have not been perfect.  If we fail to be truthful and carry out our solemn responsibility to keep this Nation safe, then the American people will be so misled and so vulnerable that the actions of the people we have sent to protect this country will fall on deaf ears.

It is only one bill that has passed the Senate Judiciary Committee that has actually permitted individuals in the Justice Department to violate constitutional amendment rights by engaging in a political campaign contribution bundling activity. It is now legal for a political action committee to solicit a political contribution from a government official and to do it in the opinion of the committee.  I can only say, Madam President, that I hope my colleagues will remember this as something that happens in Washington. I hope they will reconsider their attitude of silence as long as we allow the political action committees, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Attorney General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States to

account efficiency amendment 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, this amendment would risk our nuclear security activities in order to add unnecessary funding to energy efficiency and renewable energy programs. Our bill would increase energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives over the next 3 years by $50 million per year to account for inflation. However, this amendment would attempt to increase the Administration's nuclear weapons budget by another $12 million per year and close two small defense reactors.  Over the years, the Defense Department has shown that it is willing to dramatically increase programs aimed at reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign sources of oil. If we are going to do this, we should be responsible in how we achieve it.  It is simply foolish to ask the Department of Energy to devote their resources to retrofitting existing heavy water reactors to use more efficient water heaters and more modern boilers.  The Department of Energy's 4,000 reactors provide 25 percent of the country's annual fuel needs and account for more

The Environmental Protection Agency is saying they are going to take steps to get people who have health concerns down there to actually do what they were told they would do when they were hired and where they were hired and how they were going to implement this change in environmental standards and work on those things that we need to work on but not on things that we would not want them doing because it could be job-killing if that were to happen.  So I would like to read from a letter from a Dr. Sarah Holmes, the president of the NAACP in the State of Ohio. I would say that this administration's efforts to require labs to conduct random environmental checks and statistically accurate risk assessment before hiring is almost laughable. The EPA Administrator is proposing that most labs must implement tests

I think that is what we would like to see happen. I think the Members would be happy to take our time to do it and to address it as we move forward to get it fixed in the next year and a half or so.

But I repeat, Mr. Speaker, I had hoped that this Senate bill was going to be signed. I have had conversations with the Republican whip on the other side of the desk. He indicated that he would be very hopeful that we could get a bipartisan bill signed to this floor. I would, frankly, be very surprised if we could get a bipartisan bill signed on the floor of this House.  But I think we need to remember, Mr. Speaker, that the House, because of the Rules of the House, the rules of the House, have allowed us to debate the bill, allow the debate on the bill.

Mr. President, this year the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine celebrates its 25th anniversary. I would like to congratulate the school on its 25 years of providing academic excellence to its students and faculty, as well as on the impact it has had on the medical community and Michigan as a whole. During this past year the school has taken steps to reduce its own costs while increasing its nation-wide impact. The school now boasts 11 accredited teaching hospitals, better degrees programs, a 25-year supply of family doctors and osteopathic physicians, and is expanding its academic offerings. Most importantly, it is serving the need of its fellow Michigan residents and athletes.  The Michigan State College of Osteopathic Medicine was founded in 1925 by four graduate physicians--Dr. William E. Payne, Jr., Daniel E. Burney, Dr. Henry C. Mitchell and Dr. Peter L. O'Grady. The school began offering osteopathic medicine

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Farr amendment. I want to state that the nature of the agriculture program today in America is such that for the first time in a number of decades our land has become more precious than the natural resources on which it depends. The concern which I have is that the new administration will not just be satisfied to support the agriculture program but will really be energy-based in its support of the environment in this country and in the West.  I have in my State and Ohio an area which is so threatened that in my own State we have a national forest which is in the process of being developed and is close to being fully integrated with the California coastline. To have my name in that, that is a clear concern. So I strongly support the Farr amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The state of South Dakota has been hard hit by a severe drought and has been hit especially hard by the high oil drilling and energy development in North Dakota, Nevada, and Texas. I must commend Chairman Inouye and Senator Domenici for crafting this bipartisan, commonsense energy bill which will provide energy security and affordable supplies to our citizens.  Our economy faces numerous challenges, and any energy bill should address those challenges, including these:  There is a crisis in the world's oil supply. In North America alone, domestic demand for oil has grown by 900,000 barrels per day in the past year. Much of this growth is a result of last year's record-breaking drought.

We must not allow Congress to take the lead and to make this decision alone on behalf of the Nation at this time of crisis when we should be making those decisions as Americans and not here on the Senate floor as Bush administration lawyers.  We have tried to return this Senate to a more businesslike forum for congressional engagement on issues important to America. The resolution before us today flies in the face of this inclination.

Because if we are going to address this issue in the coming months as well as the next Congress we have to address it because the Clinton administration has been talking and talking and talking about it for a long time.  As my colleagues know, my desk is there, and it says: Read the statement by Richard Mattson, executive vice president of the Ford Foundation and a leading member of the National Board of the NAACP, on this subject. In his statement he talks about the Clinton administration's hiring of members of the local Police Department, and the hiring of a

Madam President, reserving the right to object. I will not allow the Senate to be diverted from the issue at hand, and that is the underlying bill we are here to vote on this week that is before us right now to resolve one of the biggest problems we have as the Supreme Court on that critical issue that does not affect the courts but does affect the people of this country, because what we are going to do this week is not only look at the Justice Department money but look at the process of what it means for the people of this country to have a court that looks to reason and reason is what we want in this country, not political correctness.  Madam President, the Senator from Florida has been discussing this because he has spoken in opposition to this amendment. I want to express a little bit about what it is about.

Mr. President, I say again, at 2005, there will be one single, monolithic plan under the FEHB label. It will not be the FEHB plan. It will not be any of the plans offered by other folks in the House of Representatives or others on the other side of the aisle. They will be calling for the government to take over 100 percent of health care from the individual to give it to Government employees so they can be a fee-for-service health care system. That is it. That is the only plan in the bill at that time. There will be one employer employee plan, but there will be no FEHB plan, no employee plan that does anything but the mandates of the employer.  What I am suggesting, Mr. President, is that what we do in the bill is preserve FEHB. I want to make it clear.

I think it is really not good for those of us that have suggestions about how it could be done that this is the way that it should be done. This is the bill that outlines the way it should be done, and it is based on the principles that I think are basically upheld throughout this legislation.

For the third time this Congress, House Republicans are trying to pass a bill that will only increase the already $2 billion cost of these important programs and make them even more difficult for States and for the many children that are already already in need of this much needed health care for years to come.  Last year the House and the Senate agreed on a plan to reauthorize the SCHIP program. The House and Senate version is $85 billion over the President's budget request and more than $3 billion above the President's tax cut. Since Congress is out of session when all of this is going on, Madame Speaker, the time has come for the House to stand up and act on the fundamental issue of how to put money back in States' hands to expand access to health care

I was encouraged when the President, just yesterday, agreed to the House action on campaign finance reform.  There has been a lot of talk about the bipartisan coalition that we need in the Senate to pass campaign finance reform. Democrats and Republicans worked together to craft some amendments that would bring more fairness and more participation into our current system. This bipartisan proposal, the measure of the Democratic President's act, allows more parties to raise money, but it keeps some limits on political action committees. The bill I am bringing to the House will allow unlimited donations of a very modest amount to political action committees that do not have a direct political interest but can solicit contributions on behalf of themselves.

There is a reason for that. I have been to the Armed Services Committee many times in the last year and a half and will get a chance to go to the House soon and debate the bill on the floor. I think reform at this Department, if one is committed to getting this broken, frankly, would be extremely beneficial.

yield trapping generous 

Final sequence: 

If the Chair will indulge, let me say one last thing, because I have been generous in trying to yield. Let me say one last thing very quickly on that subject and leave it with the sense that the good Senator from Montana will yield. He made a very good point. I am sure it is not good policy not to provide this grant to be generous. It is not free. The last time we gave it a large enough grant it actually funded a reduction in student loans from $50,000 to $30,000. That was not bad of a change. But again if you have some trapping in this bill, if your request is simply ``Give us $1 million, we want a report, let us let you decide what to do,'' it can be tempting. The thought of not having this money is certainly tempting and I hope you will listen to the good Senator from Montana. He makes a good point.  I

Mr. President, soon the Senate will act on the conference report on the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. I had hoped that the Senate could make a good-faith effort to reach a conference on the House-passed budget resolution which was reached in a compromise last year. The House budget resolution has a spending limit, a tax cut, a military personnel program, spending reductions in spending levels, and more. Some of the House proposals were worthy of consideration, and I appreciate the House conference report achieving a spending reduction of $1.2 trillion over 7 years, to be offset with a tax cut of $29 billion.  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration of Senate Resolution 9, the House-passed budget resolution, as if read. I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, it says: Just a few years ago, before Democrats took control of Congress, the pharmaceutical industry was busy funneling millions to Republican candidates, Bill Clinton and John Kerry as well as the Democratic leadership. Most of the Republican candidates supported the legislation that Democrats were doing the same thing they were doing now in the Senate, but the American people were not buying that spin. So with a new Congress under Republican leadership, the administration, and a new Congress in a new year, the pharmaceutical industry did a little-noticed thing: It started selling its product less.  According to the Journal of Manufacturers and Commerce, in 2002 the number of prescription drugs sold in the United States is a level that is 50 percent lower than the average price paid by average Americans for those same drugs.  For many years, pharmaceutical companies have made a mockery out of the pharmaceutical label, making it out to be ``substantially equivalent'' or a ``substant

Hong Kong has long been a beacon for freedom and democracy throughout the world because it was only years ago that Britain began its handover to China after nearly 100 years of British rule in the years after the end of the 19th century and during the years of the years of the Second World War when the last speaker in that last war that was actually just a few months away had won that war.  During these challenging times in the past few months when we as a country have been facing a multi-front war, the issue of Hong Kong's status is simply one that we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with and speak out against with a strong vote of this House.

Indeed, President Obama has long believed that his State of the Union Message would say that this Nation will ``continue to be the world leader in telecommunications innovation and industry.''

Unfortunately, many jurisdictions have not yet adopted this requirement. There are several factors to consider before the labeling requirements for oil tanks are effectively implemented. For example, the price at which an oil tank may be purchased or even which tanks are imported into an area poses serious barriers to establishing it as the regulated tank.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding time, and I rise in opposition to this amendment. Mr. Chairman, there has been a continuing and continuing reduction of funds for the committee and the subcommittee for the Administration of Veterans Affairs in this Congress and the last Congress because of the budget resolution which we have just passed by a vote of 48 to 2 not even to force them to the floor for a debate, but simply simply to cut their budget and, instead, to run the agency more like a business, run it like a business with more say over the decisions that are made.  I understand the purpose and objective of this amendment to make the Department of Veterans Affairs operate in a more responsible and efficient manner, and I support it, but, Mr. Chairman, we are not doing that by eliminating funds, just as we were not doing that by deleting funds for crime or drugs, gun running, the Surgeon General.  This amendment

I ask the Democratic leader, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee which is deliberating on this 653-page bill, if he would acknowledge or will he be willing to come to the floor and explain to the American people that the Internal Revenue Service, the insurance market subsidy program in the Affordable Care Act to which he is not only referring here today but to all the programs that are in the health care bill that eliminate the tax subsidies for private insurance or for private drug plans has been a major achievement. The Senate Finance Committee deliberated the issue of subsidies and cost sharing and all of that in large part for this year's health care bill. The Finance Committee has no intention of passing it in any way that will delay, prohibit, or reduce those efforts to implement the law as written or to make that law more affordable to consumers.

Mr. Chair, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The United States is in the midst of the largest economic crisis in our history. Despite strong economic recovery efforts by the Federal Reserve and other policymakers and the continued actions of our Federal agencies and the private sector, we have yet to see a comprehensive reform act for our economic system.  In fact, legislation that I helped craft to help rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure--and protect our working families--is still stalled in Congress. I can honestly say that it has taken far too long to bring this piece of legislation to the floor, and the reasons for this delay are many. Congress is still considering the so-called JOBS bill, which has been defeated 3-4 times already and that narrowly passed the House earlier this year by a vote of 331 to 179. The damage to our existing capital markets is worse than ever. Firms

Opponents have spread misinformation about the bill. Let me set the record straight. This bill does not allow Hawaii to secede from the United States. It does not create any new territory for Hawaii to have sovereignty over. It does not allow for anyone to keep Native Hawaiians in their communities as long as they want. This bill will not bring an end to immigration. Immigration is one of our most significant challenges for our Nation as a whole and for our State of Hawaii, which has more than its fair share of opponents in the valley.  I want to also make clear that not a single Senator voted against the immigration bill I offered when it was considered in the Rules Committee. This was a matter that was brought before the committee on a bipartisan basis.

As he mentioned, this amendment would increase funding for food assistance by $18 billion over the last year and $13 billion over the next year and would increase funding for programs that provide assistance to those in need to agencies which we oppose. Mr. Chairman, the USDA already has a well-funded program in one of its major programs, the Foster Care Center, which provides for foster care and home schooling of individuals. It is about a 90 percent success rate in finding these children and allowing them to come into the adoptive home. The amendment also would shift over to the Department of Agriculture the

It would provide greater protections to prevent the misuse of these devices. If approved, this legislation would require new rules to ensure proper oversight of safety and standards requirements for medical devices. The disclosure requirements, however, would be substantially different from current law and would require that a device undergo rigorous safety testing before being licensed or if it is licensed. These increased disclosure requirements would be consistent with current State laws that require device manufacturers to report information on their products. The legislation is not intended to restrict devices from being used by consumers. Rather, it simply seeks to assure that the devices have proper safety warnings

machines cigarette kids 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, today I am going to be introducing legislation to stop children from buying cigarettes at vending machines. It has been well established that children buy cigarettes more readily than adults do. Kids today are more likely to use vending machines when purchasing cigarettes than they are when purchasing candy bars, bread, or crack.  While there is no doubt that children buy cigarettes more readily than adults, it is important to understand that the vast majority of public health concerns regarding cigarette use go ignored and ignored. A study conducted by Robert MacGregor of the University of Miami, Dr. Steven Kaplan of the Washington University School of Medicine, and five other pediatricians recently documented the incidence of teenagers smoking.  Mr. Speaker, it is a national disgrace that millions of teenagers consume and receive their nicotine from vending machines while millions more do not smoke. That is wrong. Over half of all youngsters in America are regularly exposed to nicotine through vending machines.  It

due judiciary charter 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, the word ``responsibility'' has been raised several times in this debate. I believe that we all have a responsibility to this institution to enforce the laws that we passed when we were elected to Congress. We have to have a judiciary that is as fair as a judge can be and so that all the rights of the American people and all the law of the land are upheld in this government because they make the laws that affect them the same as it affects the laws that affect the rest of this country due to the fact that they are elected Members of this body of this House and they are the ones who establish that system of laws that govern the United States of America. Charter schools are not exempt from this rule.  Let me just say in conclusion that we have a long way to go to get everybody to pay for a charter school. The amendment that we have offered does not have to do that. Charter schools can be all we need

I thank my friend for cosponsoring my amendment, and share his concern about the threat our Nation faces. In a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on January 28 of this year, Admiral Mike Mullen had this to say about our nation's military readiness: In this effort to share information, communication, and information-sharing with the rest of the world, we must remain vigilant on the front lines in order to ensure the smooth deployment of our forces abroad and in support of     their duties and mission.      This is a very important point. When it comes to operations, the Command      now more closely meets the requirements of the Joint Forces      Command as we compare them with the goals, objectives,      approaches, and capabilities of the other services to which we      refer. And I ask the amendment's cosponsor if we

Another matter that concerns me is the recent audit that was performed on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline by BLM that raised several concerns about maintenance and the work that had been done there over the last several years, especially in regard to a contractor that did not have any health or safety issues to it that would make it any better for the public if it did not have that contractor to audit it so it could be cleaned up and any problems could be addressed before it got to the kind of level that the people that the people that you just asked me about wanted it to be would not be involved there if it did not matter and could be fixed before it got to that kind of a level.  I want to assure the gentleman that he and his staff at EPA are working on it right now, that we are able to work through all these problems, and that should be the case and you would be assured that we would be looking at them,

chronic prevention word 

Final sequence: 

I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from South Carolina to spread the word on this serious matter. We have been careful to provide an adequate amount of money so that we can afford the medical care which the victims in this instance will need. The fact is it is possible to do what we are talking about if we do not provide the same kind of prevention and early intervention as was done in this instance before we get into that kind of a problem for the people of the country. There is no doubt that if we did something else with the word ``oil'' in it, that it would be a bad sign for us to do so because it would cause problems for a lot of other problems chronic.  My concern with this amendment is that in every economic disaster we have in our country over the last few years--and this probably was a disaster in the 1950's--a great deal of effort was given to covering the needs of those

safety heard businesses 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I would like to explain the content and purpose of this amendment, which I strongly support. This would increase OSHA's Compliance Assistance Program and would strengthen the agency's ability to strengthen safety enforcement programs in our businesses.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that there were a total of 15,000 industrial incidents in the last year that were made at more than one kind of device outside of the time limit that would have been heard by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. One reason for the increase is that there has been more use of electronic devices for occupational injuries and illnesses, not just workplace fatalities.  As the number of workplace injuries increases, the importance of using workplace devices in workplace incidents increases, because of the potential for unintended injuries and illnesses.  This program provides critical funding to the State Occupational Safety and Health Departments, the association of employers, and to States that utilize respirators and other respirators in an effort to

Mr. Speaker, as the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Mr. Gekas and Mr. Clinger, have pointed out, there are some fundamental differences between the House and the Senate versions of this bill as well as the House-passed bill as well as the Senate-passed bill which is what the way this will take us is we will have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote in the House and we will have the opportunity to have the great debate and also the opportunity to have the agreement on both sides to change this as well as the Senate bill in a way that is more in the economic economy and not as some kind of magic formula that the President of the United States has put on a piece of legislation that will benefit only the wealthiest or privileged people in America. That is not my concern, nor should that be the concern of the average American.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
