Mr. Chairman, we are ready to debate this amendment tonight. The issue of the Forest Service's management of the Upper Colorado River and the Stewardship Council in particular is a fundamental issue. What we are saying is that there is no limit on the ability of the council to make changes to the proposed regulation that needs to be adopted in order to continue the waterway on the Federal trust lands.  This is not a special deal for the Upper Colorado River or for the Stewardship Council. It is an issue which is a government problem, and it needs to be resolved.  Mr. Chairman, we would be prepared to discuss this amendment tonight

Mr. President, the government of Egypt has once again been unable to keep its promise to its people to give them the goods and services they need to be successful. Its failure to produce the same security for its own people is another indication that the past year has been a dismal one for the Government of Egypt, the people who helped make it where it is now and the people who have worked so hard to get it to that point. The only way to put things right is to have the kind of stability that Egypt has needed for the past year and a half to start to improve its workable economic condition and create a better place for the country's people

The President has requested emergency spending of nearly $1 trillion over the last 2 years. This could not happen without the help of Congress and the President of the United States.  As the State of the Union was in the process of being prepared on the first and only emergency spending bill since 1946, President Clinton made the determination to take us in a new direction with the political and economic initiatives that came out of that State of the Union address.

Mr. Speaker, a couple of weeks ago there was a public meeting in Seattle, Washington.

They presented a new water bill and it was passed unanimously on both sides of the aisle in the Seattle City Council.  Now what the Speaker said in the last few weeks is that she never heard of anything before.

Mr. Speaker, today the Federal Government is on the brink of default on its national debt. This is going to cause a crisis that will require a fiscal crisis to get us out of it and to start dealing with the national debt as we deal with health care and tax reform.  The Republican leadership is a party that wants to cut and run the Federal Government to the ground. They do not want the American people to see that a budget that is too big for the Federal Government does not create jobs or the economy or the national security. They would like us to accept the Democratic budget that is a budget that has an increase of $30 billion in the

Yesterday, the Republican leadership announced that it would not offer a tax cut for working families or reduce the deficit for 3 weeks to accommodate a Republican

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this irresponsible bill and in support of the Committee on Ways and Means' reform package. When you add up the cost of every existing proposal to those that we have just heard about in the past few hours and add up the deficit it is clear that this House and the Committee on Ways and Means have failed to meet the fiscal responsibility that has been required for years by the American people. The President and the Congressional Budget Office have said that over the next 10 years, this bill will add $200 billion to the deficit and more than $300 billion in revenue to the Federal Treasury. This is simply unacceptable.

While I support this rule for its economic impact and potential for raising wages, I must say that I share much of the frustration with the current system that allows too many workers to be held back from making ends meet in this age of increasing worker productivity and employment opportunities.

The statement follows: The title of the Senate bill says it all. They are making it harder for terrorists to do their job and the American people deserve to know the source of the money.

For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that during fiscal year 1996 the Federal Government spent $1,263 per household on personal and business business expenses. This is well above the inflation-adjusted annual cost of living increase of 2.3 percent for the whole economy. It is less than one-fourth the inflation-adjusted cost of health care over the past decade.  More shocking is that our Federal budget deficit actually increased during the first 3 months of fiscal year 1996. That is

The National Association of State Fish and Wildlife Agencies has stated that this amendment will increase the Department of Agriculture budget by $13 million over the current year and $28 million over the fiscal year 1997 budget request.

Today, this vote is yet another step in our effort to ensure that American families can care for their children. While the increase that this resolution raises is less than the $14,100 that the Speaker of the House has stated, this is the first time in more than a decade that an increase has been raised in the national child care costs because of this increase in the AMT that will not adversely affect the average family

We know that Iran and North Korea have put on show their readiness to attack the United States or to retaliate against our failure to respond to their aggression in a decisive and effective way. We know that North Korea has built a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States and would not hesitate to use it against the United States if we did not act to prevent it. We know that

The American people must realize that while the next war may not be their fault, the people who will be the beneficiaries of that war are their fellow Americans and future generations.

Mr. President, I would like to make it clear that I have nothing but sympathy for all of the Senators who have come forward to express their grief and loss over the passing of the late Senator Ted Stevens. Senator Stevens passed away in early November on the side of the Senate Democratic caucus when he was severely injured by an ``unidentified hostile force.'' His last year of service as a Senator was even more valuable to me than his earlier years of service as chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. I must express my deepest sympathy for his family and his many friends and colleagues who will be affected by his passing today and over the next month and a half.

Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to the gentleman from California [Mr. Lewis], this is not about health care for those we are discussing. We all know that health care costs for the middle class are going to increase. How can that be said if this plan passes when the President said that this bill would reduce taxes for the middle class by $500 for 2 years? I ask the question, if health care costs are going to increase if you take the Affordable Care Act with it to the United States of America, should health care costs be reduced under this plan with no consideration of the environment and the environment protection that we already have? How can

Mr. Speaker, as we know the taxpayers are coming up short every single year. The Nation is running over budget deficits. The President is threatening to close our borders to illegal immigration. Every aspect of our culture is under threat by illegal immigration and our public health care system is being eaten up by the much larger issue of illegal immigration. I stand in opposition to the Republican plan and its drastic impact on the economy and our Nation's public health.  The Nation should never again take a step like this on a large scale. It is irresponsible and unacceptable for our President to continue on this path of deficit spending while the private sector does not want to do anything

Mr. President, I had hoped to offer an amendment on which we would have been able to come together on an agreement in a resolution.

So I was not available at that time and had to try to reach a time agreement that would have allowed us to get that done. But that is my understanding.   Finally, I would just like to say

And Senator Clinton has offered a strategy for finding a solution that works in both ways. His plan seems to be competing with Senator McCain's who seem to advocate war based on politics rather than justice. There seems to be no real, credible way to seek the goal and achieve the objective without a massive military buildup and escalation and possibly the support of the Chinese and Russians. This puts both candidates in a tough position. I don't believe either candidate is going to be able to deal with this balanced agenda

Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the House unanimously passed legislation to eliminate the use of private funding for abortion in many cases.  Mr. Speaker, the way the Republican leadership approaches legislation is to send it back to the Committee on Ways and Means. That means Congress must consider the bill as written, and vote on it by committee, on a voice vote in the Congress. This is what the Republicans are doing to the bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly overwhelmingly and became law last year, and we should act accordingly.  It is so controversial to oppose abortion at all that we have put provisions in this bill that will allow parents to refuse abortion services and
