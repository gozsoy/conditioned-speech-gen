Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, we have to realize that a resolution of disapproval of the $600 million we are now voting on with respect to several problems that we have discussed here just that can be fixed would only make those problems worse, and would not fix any of these problems that we have as that which satisfy the right of Congress to have a full discussion and discussion, a full and fair discussion on one subject, one subject. The economic issues that I discuss on the floor are not economic problems. They are legal problems. I am not going to play partisan politics. I am saying you

Although the July 2005 report does not name specific subcategories or subdermal officers assigned to lieutenant and command or overall staff, the report correctly notes that ``Congress required the GAO to analyze potential annual expenditures by the Federal Government in so-called underserved regions in order to identify policy implications and to develop cost-benefit analyses for important investments

This is not a bill to ask the States to choose their citizens over the States or the people they represent to decide their own health care policy or choose to refuse to provide coverage to all Americans who want to seek it or enroll in it.  I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that the most effective way to restrict access to health care services to the most vulnerable Americans is by requiring that they have access to quality, affordable health insurance. I appreciate my friend from Connecticut bringing that up.  But the reality is that this legislation repeals and replaces all of these provisions that

The increasing Federal Government has come to be seen as a major burden on agencies with a per-person cost ratio calculated by research firm Coversys.  But as current budgets demand dramatic budget cuts--from many programs, including Federal education and an overabundance of wasteful government programs--some are asking what alternative will solve the problems?  Many are asking: How can we cut waste

Mr. Speaker, let me just say I think what the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher] and others have to do is step back and ask the President what the President would have us do here in the United States if the free world itself was willing to put our troops in harm's way in Bosnia for that purpose. As we stand here today, the United States is not willing to take the secular allies of a sovereign nation. I think this represents the wrong course, and I think the American people know that.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This is a well- coorsed bill that we worked together to produce, to eliminate our dependence on Russia and the oil industry. This has been an important brewing issue for us, and we are pleased to be able to add this bill to this very important list of bipartisan legislation.  I would ask, first of all, Mr. Speaker, are the Virginians who are going to be affected by this bill too economically and not able to pay their bills?  Secondly, is it not more acceptable

The President has also written us a budget that begins to balance the Federal budget.  Our budget is balanced--but that is not what I care about. What I care about is what we are going to do to raise revenue to pay for deficit reduction.  My plan

I believe it is imperative that we provide healthcare benefits to every American and I support the concept that if the government is truly going to try to help small business, it ought to do so through a national or regional competition rather than through setting its own rules.  As my colleagues know, the Financial CHOICE Act is yet another attempt by the President to force the government to set the rules for the private sector.  It is not necessary to measure whether the private sector does

Madam Speaker, this week the House of Representatives is considering the national security implications of the 9/11 attacks on the United States and the time has come for the Congress to take action to address the threat of an even greater and much more deadly threat to our people today that will happen just as we talk about the needs for a well-timed 9/11 Memorial. So I sat down with Congresswoman Serrano from the Government Reform and Oversight Committee and my ranking member Congressman Hollings and they asked us to work on a bill that will direct our Nation's intelligence agencies to investigate the intelligence that causes us to have these threats and provide the right tools

He was elevated to the position by the Republican Party in 2006, and he has left us far behind.  Under this new administration, they have rushed through regulations that have stifled economic growth. But they have no problems with attacking Republicans who are trying to protect public health or safety or the environment or help

That money goes out to the revolving door and not the revolving door into the intelligence community where the President has identified the concerns.

Well, the fact of the matter is that this bill will not. The bill will have almost no effect on the epidemic of tobacco, as much as its advocates would like you to believe it.  The bill will direct the Food and Drug Administration to stop listing products which contain as little as 1 percent of tar as a tobacco product. They would only allow such products for those products which contain less than 5 percent of tar.  A patent held by Big Tobacco has already been cited by the
