Mr. President, we have come a long way in the last 25 years. The first bill I introduced, the Fair Minimum Wage Act, was signed into law by President Reagan.

The President says that the budget is balanced in 7 years. The fact is that the Congressional Budget Office said it is going to be almost impossible to balance the budget in 7 years, because the Congressional Budget Office's projections show that the Government will run out of money in the year 2002, that the Government will run out of money in the year 2005, and that the Government will run out of

Mr. Chairman and Nation policy activities, I rise in opposition to H.R. 831, the Defense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 1996.  I would like to thank Chairman Spence and Ranking Member Heflin for their efforts in producing this important legislation.  Mr. Chairman, the first section of the bill deals with our defense needs. This section contains a $5.7 billion budget request for military personnel and their families. This is a large amount of money, and one that is much needed by our military.  It is not surprising that this amount of money is needed by our military. In the last 5 years, the number of

Mr. President I want you to know how things really look worse than makeshift tents. It is difficult to comprehend how many people are in our country who are uninsured, underinsured, underinsured and underinsured and still are without health insurance.  Mr. President, we are going to have to take action to fix this problem. We have to do it now. We have to fix it for the American people.  If we pass this bill today, millions of Americans will lose their health insurance coverage, and this is bad for our economy.  Mr. President, this is bad for the American people.  I yield the floor.

Mr. President President security agents at our border with Mexico are being asked to enforce the laws of the land rather than acting as a rubberstamp for President Trump's cruel and heartless policy.  Last week, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, announced that it was waiving the hiring and promotion requirements for border agents to work at the Nation's southern border.  For the first time in a decade, this change in policy could have dire consequences for the lives of law enforcement agents and their families.  As a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I am deeply concerned that this move would be harmful to the safety of border

In 1990, the Clinton administration requested a $50 billion package of welfare reform. The Republican-controlled Congress responded by passing the Contract With America, which imposed tough new limits on welfare, increased the work requirement, and cut benefits for those on welfare.  The President responded by vetoing the Republican-passed welfare bill. The Clinton administration then passed a new welfare bill, which again imposed new work requirements, reduced benefits, and cut benefits for those on welfare.  Mr

The United States has turned a blind eye to Cuba's economic woes and has stood by as a trading partner that has lost its edge.  In the words of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, the embargo ``made things worse.''  Our trading partners have not shown any signs of lifting the embargo.  In addition, we have done little to restore normal relations with Cuba.

When I talk to my constituents, I ask them how many of them are looking at their tax return this year and wondering if they are going to have enough money to pay their bills? When I talk to the women who came to see me this morning and told me they have lost their jobs, they are worried about the future of their children.

Mr. Speaker and Federal programs that businesses rely on for their success are struggling to find the money to fund the programs that are necessary to keep their doors open and to hire more workers.  In my home State of Minnesota, unemployment is 10.2 percent. That is the highest rate in the Nation. In my district, there are more than 4,500 unemployed workers. More than 80 percent of the people who want to work have not been able to find a job in the last month.  In the short term, this must change. But in the long term, we need to do something to help these workers. The Republican tax bill would make

My concern with the amendment is not its content. In fact, the amendment's provisions would limit the freedom of the people to make certain decisions regarding the color of their flag. It is also not a proper means of improving the Constitution, because it would prevent the government from having to address the most important constitutional issue of our time.

Mr. President home region West Virginia is often overlooked in the debate over immigration. I rise today to pay tribute to a community that has for years been the only place that undocumented immigrants can legally live and work in the United States.  The story of West Virginia is not a story of its own making. Its origin story goes back to 1763, when Charles Pickering, a German immigrant, landed in the West Virginia Colony of Virginia. After an attempt to work his way across the Atlantic, Charles made the dangerous journey across the Potomac to the Great Lakes. After arriving in Baltimore, Charles picked up his family and settled in the cities of Providence

This bill includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008, which is over a year away, as well as for fiscal year 2007.  While it is true that the bill before us today includes a $4.5 billion increase for DHS, I believe the real priority should be funding for the Department of

It is her strong commitment to fight for human rights that has earned her the respect of her colleagues and the admiration of the American people.  In the last year, her subcommittee has passed numerous pieces of legislation to address these and other critical human rights issues, including the original Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed this
