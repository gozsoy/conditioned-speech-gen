Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to work with the gentleman to ensure the Department has the funds to support the projects authorized in this bill. In discussions with the gentleman and others in this body, the priority is to meet these needs while preserving funding for others important priorities. This bill provides adequate funding for the Department of Energy to meet certain needs for its efforts to satisfy the Clean Air Act's public health, environmental, and energy mandates. I believe this bill continues our commitment to making our air cleaner and provides sufficient funding for projects to reduce emissions and meet those objectives without cutting programs vital to economic growth, workers' safety, and, most importantly, the health and well-being of citizens of this Nation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, today, the Senate has approved landmark legislation to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the next 3 years. The reauthorization will be the third reauthorization of education funding since 2000 and the first time children will have a child support payment from their education program after school and college graduation. This bill has made significant and positive contributions to students' academic achievement.  The reauthorization bill also holds up important priorities for States, such as the central requirement in Section 504 for 3 months before the school year begins, school construction funds, and the School-to-Work Partnership Program. The legislation reduces the downpayment for students on Head Start from $35,000 to $26,000. It makes the National Service Program pilot program permanent and increases student assistance to help States and the Federal Government build rural schools.

Instead of making the government bigger, we need to right-size government and reform government. Rather, let us reform government by cutting costs for middle-class families, families that are struggling just to make ends meet, families that should be working and have the opportunity for a fair tax policy that represents middle-class values, not a government-driven, tax-supported welfare system. Senator Feinstein spoke of the Democratic health care proposals, which include provisions to move forward on truly moving families to work and allowing people to earn their own way by working hard. We do that by a balanced approach to the prescription drug bill, which ensures all our seniors receive high-quality health insurance, and we do it through the Affordable Care Act, a full-fledged health care system that will help lower costs for people, particularly for low-income families.

At the outset I want to speak about the positive impact of this policy. Many industries were devastated by the Great Depression, and large numbers of our citizens were on the brink of welfare. Small businesses and workers have always been at the forefront of technological advances and the promotion of new technologies in the United States. In every industrial sector, they have performed well. This has led to a renewed enthusiasm in our domestic economy for advanced industrial technology.  This is especially true of agriculture.

Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute today to two eminent Alaskans, Tom and Susan Hoeffel, who are paying tribute to one another in the big city of Washington, DC, for their moving 50 years of distinguished service to the School of the Pacific Northwest. The two Hoeffels worked as teachers for the school for more than 20 years and have raised over $5 million for higher education at the school which is now known as Pacific Northwest University in Seattle. In the years since the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors passed legislation designating the school as a ``Theater of the Pacific Northwest'' in 1975, the Hoeffels have been actively involved with the school.  In 1981, the superintendents of the Washington State Board of Education and the Washington State Department of Education became aware that the H

Is it not true that these very same universally supported protocols in terms of receiving reports from the high-level commanders regarding combat conditions in the field have been made unreviewable as far as we are concerned and that there is no request made in the future to make those protocols unfunded by the President's budget?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

We have been at this for many years, and as we have discussed on this floor, it is time for a new vision for American research.

Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, there has been a great deal of discussion about the fact that this bill is almost exactly what the bill it is a part of would be, but the point of the legislation before us does not take the original bill that we passed that was $50 billion and increase it $25 billion and we add in some of the provisions that we believe would make law a better version of the bill that was passed last year.  The reason I am pointing this out is because the committee on the House side is having difficulty with what we had done in a very narrow way, which is a lot of things which could be added to this bill.  Mr. Chairman, we understand that you are not going to be able to get the money in the bill this year for those projects. But what you are doing now

The Senate does not have a balanced budget at all because we have not passed a balanced budget for 5 years in a row and we have not passed it for another 5 years in babies to pay for our debt, because Congress has not passed a balanced budget since 1976, and our deficits have outgrown our money.

So this means we have the same sense of Congress that we have in the House and other Members of the Senate can bring additional matters before us at will and the committee be allowed to pursue them at will in the same way that our House and Senate Intelligence Committees are allowed to pursue them and the executive branch are able to pursue them.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In the past 10 years the housing commission has sent over the President $50 million over their budget to fund other agencies that are just so focused on local government and public safety and security and community health and all those kinds of things. I can think of one other agency that is doing that which I have the greatest respect for which they just received the money so they could work for the women that they were supposed to work for because they wanted to bring some money in for them. And they just came back and announced that retirement funds and the money that they got for Medicaid for women would be so small and so inadequate that the agency could not support it, the retirement fund for Medicaid in Washington, DC would not even receive the money in these other local agencies

Section 116 would prohibit the National Park Service from carrying out boat inspection or safety programs for National Recreation and Historical Parks. In addition, Congress should have the right to eliminate boat inspection and safety programs for any State or county or park and prohibit all watercraft from engaging in these activities. Why is this legislation important? Because Alaska is home to 11 million people. With over 2,300 park miles, it is home to one of our Nation's great recreational areas. Safety measures for watercraft are critical to many Americans and should be incorporated into these Federal programs. Why is this legislation important? Because law enforcement officers and other safety personnel at National Recreation and Historical Parks are required to perform 2,000 man-hours of enforcement duties every year. Without these enforcement activities, there is a chance that a visitor to a State park, for

Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by my good friend from Oklahoma. This is a time when American families need a tax policy that is fair and that is not so Washington driven and that is not so hand raised and that is not so tilted towards the very rich in our country. It is a time when the change we need is that the same small business and middle class people that we are taking away from will get the same direction, that they will continue to be made in America. We have seen a real transformation in America, and in the last 2 years we have seen dramatic increases in the number of people making minimum wage. But we have also seen a significant shift in the growing percentage of minimum wage workers who live in poverty.  During the 1980's, most minimum wage workers had the opportunity to grow their businesses

Earlier we voted to begin this debate about whether to bring down the existing majority and take control of the Senate and provide full funding to reduce our budget deficit.

Mr. Chairman, whatever amendments Democrats offer to try to get this bill down to the line I think we have to be very careful not to try to use them as votes in order to get something that we really do not have anything to do with but what Democrats want to do and do not want to do but this is the way we get it done and that is what we do in this way because we are going after something we do not have in this way we start attacking something we do have. I do not think that is what we want to do. I think we want kids to be educated and we want to leave a well-educated population in the future.  I am not trying to pick a side here.

Mr. President, earlier today, the distinguished Senator from Utah was kind enough to propose for consideration in the Senate a very simple and straightforward proposal for making the United States more energy independent and affordable by giving the Secretary of Energy the power to direct the creation and expansion of United States oil and gas resources around the country.  Mr. President, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the American Revolution, Americans are rightly proud of the freedom to become energy independent. Now is the time to show our people that our country has the ingenuity, leadership and resolve to lead the world. If the Secretary of Energy cannot do that, then the American people have a right to expect that the Government of the United States will do so for them.  I am referring, of course, to oil and gas.

Madam Chair, I'm grateful that we're getting a chance to shine some light into the real cost of Federal healthcare.

They were 3 years old, an Indian child, on their way to school. They were supposed to have just met with their teachers. Instead, they would be having their very first ambulance ride in their lives.  And now, the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff) is in charge of our Nation's health care, and when he asks the families of these children to pay more for this first ambulance ride, it is unconscionable.

Mr. President, in our search for ways to eliminate the crushing poverty that afflicts billions of families in our country, we often turn to public and private initiatives which help alleviate poverty in our country by cutting spending, by boosting economic development, and by promoting self-sufficiency. This may not be what we think of when we think of tax cuts as paid for by tax dollars owed to the public, but I would argue that there is much more to the focus on reducing poverty than using Federal dollars to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans.  Of course, it is easy to think about the next time we call for an increase in the minimum wage or to advocate a proposal to cut benefits to children and to increase taxes on the middle class. We may think that as we do that that a minimum wage increase is too small

The Estate Tax is not a tax that we should all agree on as a tax policy or as a measure of government policy. However, the problem of the estate tax is well understood by most Americans and they understand that to allow the United States to continue to have a Federal Government who will join us in paying the estate tax we must do everything we can to encourage the creation of estate and gift tax benefits for our fellow citizens and other members of our family members who are friends and colleagues.  The estate tax has been increased over the past 20 years in an effort to lure America's largest multinational corporations to this country and now, several of these multinational corporations have been allowed to avoid the estate tax altogether and instead have spent their money overseas--

To give some context, we had a chance to debate liability reform this week. That bill should have been finished by now. The problem was that not one Member of the Judiciary Committee showed up to debate it and not one Member of the House of Representatives showed up to debate it. The reason for that is, essentially, because a

In the same year the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business, which are both Federal board members, asked the Office of Management and Budget for authorization for a new version of the act, and in response, OMB was directed to write a new bill.

Mr. President, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world for a number of years and forced Americans to face the fear and strain of chronic health conditions with a heavy hand and a lifetime of radiation and other diseases that would have been the world's death sentence had the virus not hit.  In 1944, America joined with the rest of the world in declaring war against the war-ravaged, but defiantly, Axis Germany. The war delayed our advance in the Pacific until July 1943. That was the United States' first full month of war, while the European allies laid waste to our airfields, nuclear installations, and men in my own infantry fighting in a gallantly short 9-month period of combat.  When the war ended, between 5 and 12 million Americans would have died had we not recognized the plight of millions

Mr. Chairman, in response to some of the comments that were never made, I would like to make this comment that there has been much more consensus for the Department of Defense since it took the unprecedented step of not having two major defense conferences in the same time for a very long time that it did with the first one in 1999 when the Defense Policy and Administration Act was made mandatory. I think there is much more that needs to be done on how to provide quality for defense personnel and what is appropriate to do for environmental protection and EPA.

Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple. It establishes an office within the National Security Council which would act as an independent official within the executive branch and conduct criminal intelligence reviews to determine who the people of Russia are in the United States and who the people of Russia are in Georgia and who the people of Georgia are in Georgia. The purpose of this office would be to prevent conflicts in which United States citizens flee to the former Soviet Union in order to escape the penalty of their criminal activities in the former Soviet Union and in Georgia and in the former county of Georgia. I think the reason why this is important is that this would allow an organized crime-fighting organization in the United States to be formed.

Congress must repeal this bill because it will leave many Americans more dependent on the help they provide to them and their families. But instead of considering legislation to repeal the 2010 health care bill, the Republican leadership decided to bring out another one, which will allow businesses to discriminate against their employees based on preexisting conditions.

This bipartisan bill makes critical cuts in federal spending to help American families reduce their health care costs and help create jobs. This bill will help provide incentives for companies to use innovative cost-saving measures to save money on their health insurance costs. It will also help insure some people who need no help at all.  I would also like to thank all of the many Federal workers who are supporting this bill. There are more than 200 Federal workers in New York, who are currently providing health insurance to their families.  The majority leader has indicated the need for this bill.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1380, which temporarily suspends class action lawsuits filed in State courts when such lawsuits would result in the payment of excessive fees to plaintiffs and class members without an independent judicial review or a bill of particulars that would require the President to submit to Congress for approval before rescinding class action waivers.  These waivers, which have been used to dramatically expand class action lawsuits, would put Federal, State, and local governments in a delicate position. H.R. 1380 should be upheld in its current form.  It is also essential that Federal, State, and local governments make these waivers available to individuals on the merits of their claims. They should have the opportunity to negotiate with individual plaintiffs in class actions to obtain better prices, allow lawyers to work together, and try out new products and services.

Unfortunately, the terrorist threat facing the United States today has been largely ignored for far too long and the danger is increasing. Terror crimes in the United States have risen sharply over the past decade. In 2004, more than 80,000 violent crimes were committed in the United States, far more than any previous year. These violent crimes account for over half of all murder and are responsible for the deaths of more than 750,000 Americans and more than 3 million Americans are wounded or injured each year by these acts of violence.  One example of this rise in the violence against Americans is the Woolworths shootings in New York City that took

Very definitely. As the Senator knows, management has the right to direct employees to do whatever it takes to pay their wages for those employee days. If there is not any opportunity to help pay the costs of the emergency that these are, then we have problems. This probably would not happen in any other category of job. They certainly could pick up those costs somewhere else. What we do want is things to be done so they can go on working out how we do spend those funds now so we can spend them figuring out how to get to a balanced budget and paying down the debt. We believe that is something that is appropriate, and that is what is being asked by our colleagues here.  I thank the Senator for allowing me to be an able voice for that and for helping to move this in a bipartisan way.  <|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, the Budget Committee's reconciliation bill is a vicious example of misguided fiscal and economic policy and has the potential to lead to a recession if these policies are not changed. We should not have to live with a poverty level over $18,000 and will not face long-term economic growth in our country if these policies are not changed. The reconciliation bill for the first time allows families to make a choice between taking food assistance or welfare and paying Social Security benefits. When this choice is made, it will have the potential to increase the poverty rate even more.  Mr. Speaker, more than 22 million Americans work in the private sector, as did millions of low-income families when the first welfare program was established back in 1965. Yet it costs over $32,000 a year just to pay AFDC and SSI,

Let me just point out, because we are going to hear more about this.

Fixed-pay borrowings is one of those areas where we have to come together and prioritize, where we put aside, as I said earlier, some $4 billion in the second half of this year to put to use what we can get to the taxpayers back home, $5 billion, for the first quarter of this year. For the second quarter, we have come forward with a pretty extraordinary plan. And now

Mr. Speaker, why is the Ethics Committee making the special exception in the case of a special order discussion of a party rule on partisan political issues? Why the Ethics Committee not just let an ethical debate continue instead of turning it into a political campaign that might bring in Republican money or perhaps even Republican donors? Who wants to give Republicans campaign donations if Republicans are trying to spend campaign dollars against Democrats? Newt Gingrich said that.  But I think you have to ask, Mr. Speaker, that ethics is not only about American law, but about the history of political parties as well. Look at what happened in the first election in the United States of America. It was 1972. Republicans won.  But we've had Democratic administrations since the 1970s, and I think the Republican Party since the 1980s. It was under Republican Presidents who

So if the idea is to put more bureaucrats in the office, or if they have used it, that is an agency decision to make, that should not stop a program to go forward.

Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress I spent 7\1/2\ years as a circuit court judge in the Eastern District of Texas in a case involving one of the last great successful trial lawyers in the history of the country who was well-known and well-respected for years as a prominent trial lawyer in Dallas and his employees before that and before that. He was the only trial attorney in Congress who was not convicted of perjury.  It wasn't just the judgment of the jury but the verdicts of the trial court as to the guilt and the evidence that was presented to the jury. But as a Republican and a man of our views on the right of people to judge their own verdicts, it was completely irresponsible to convict an individual on the basis of the testimony of an employee of a trial attorney's. You cannot convict somebody on the basis

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th birthday of Bill Coors, a resident of Mesa, Arizona. Bill was born in 1950 in Youngstown, Ohio. He was raised in an area of the country in which beer brewing is a major industry and where Bill enjoys being a resident in my district of northwest Arizona.  Bill was raised to support himself and his family by his father, the president of Coors Brewing Company in Youngstown, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1958 to 1970 and later the Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives. While he was involved in business, Bill was a professional baseball and football player.  In 1978, the Coors Brewing Company moved from Youngstown to Mesa, Arizona. Bill and his family settled there, with Bill serving in the Marine Corps and working as a ski

The Federal Government has finally been following through on that and coming up with a new Early Warning System in the last few years that has been very successful and just because they would do that if it did not hurt, they do it for a very good reason.

Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today is modest in amount, but it is significant because it is a line-item veto that would put in order the most unconstitutional spending cut in our history and one that is going to be funded by taxpayers. It would mandate that all Federal court orders must be granted within 5 legislative days if judicial actions are pending and that courts making final judgments against Government agencies are then instructed to report back on the findings of the General Accounting Office.  What I will say is that this is not a cut; it is not a freeze; this is the government taking over the judicial branch. It is unconstitutional. I say to my colleagues that if the government had a budget like that of the Coast Guard, the military and the U.S. Mint they would have absolutely no problems accommodating my amendment. But as I

Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Small Business Week on behalf of the millions of people that need jobs. This year alone the Federal Government created about 8 million new jobs. Yet as the most significant economic issue of our time it is important that we act to create the jobs that create opportunity for our families. I believe that creating jobs creation is a goal for which there can be no substitute. The Small Business Administration believes the private sector should play an important role in providing the financing, job training and educational opportunities for entrepreneurs and those working in the small businesses.  We need to be proactive in pursuing a tax credit for small business by establishing incentives for American companies to hire American workers. Providing an incentive for companies to hire American workers creates economic development and creates jobs. However, the Small Business Administration believes that creating jobs by lowering

Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 512 provides for the consideration of H.R. 4907, the Full Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution by the House of Representatives on July 25, 2005. The vote will occur on a voice vote and the measure will not be subject to any further action or debate in the House other than the continuing resolution for the coming year. Those who have not yet voted to insist that the Americans have the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment should do so in the manner of the people's legislature, not a piecemeal manner that is rendered by law.  The resolution before the House today has three important provisions: The bill improves a provision in the Constitution in which the President had asked Congress to agree to the prohibition on the President engaging in war without authorization from Congress; it strikes the language that would have prohibited aid to

Mr. Speaker, the only thing shocking about these recent scientific discoveries is they seem to be coming about so rapidly that most people do not even realize it is taking place and much longer that they are taking place than would be needed in most cases to determine whether disease is actually caused by a pollutant or not.  Many years ago, our scientists discovered that it takes nearly 1 billion years to grow stem cells and to make a cell into an embryo in this country. They have discovered that we have the ability to live within 8 days of being born and that many of the Illinois people who have known firsthand the profound effects of what can happen to children who suffer from these terrible disorders have said they will live much longer than necessary for their children.  Let us take a look at what we learned from the 9/11 Commission. They found

Mr. President, I rise today to support, with Senator Wicker, a resolution to raise awareness of the Armenian genocide and to recognize the United States' commitment to the eradication of this tragedy of history.  This resolution was introduced last Senator Wicker was alive. Senator Wicker was a tireless advocate for the Armenian people and one who could not be a stranger to the most painful chapters in the memory of the Holocaust. This resolution recognizes this fact in the most tangible way possible by designating the defections of a group of German, Armenian, and Hungarian Jews to the Nazi Party of Germany as genocide. It also urges the denial of this hateful act of terror to any third country.  The state of Israel is the only democracy in the world to now recognize as genocide the practice of the genocide perpetrated by the Nazis against the Armenian people during

The letter reads pretty clearly: ``Dear Chairman Specter''--and there was a copy sent to Senator Schumer that Senator Schumer also sent to Senator Democratic leader McConnell--``the next Supreme Court nomination should be made on an up-or-down vote of the Senate.

It's a perfect, fair, and straightforward statement that will, in my judgment, mean a series of votes on the motions to invoke cloture will take place that will alter the course of the confirmation process so that the product of the committee process, and that will reflect the views of the American people, will be viewed by the Supreme Court.

This is not one of those issues where the line of demarcation is drawn.  The President of the United States has raised the line on the security and defense side and some other issues. The U.N. Security Council is perhaps the only place in which we can really talk about those issues. Now I have the highest respect for President Clinton. I think he was a good President, and

Madam President, I came to the floor this afternoon because the United States Government is making $12 billion over $3 billion on our debt each year that it does not have the money to pay for it. As a matter of fact, when the President proposed spending cuts last year to reduce that spending in the last year of the Congress, the Republicans cut back Federal spending by some $24 billion to pay for those cuts which would have cut interest rates, which would have cut the cost of consumer loans, which would have cut all of that spending and brought down the debt over $20 trillion.  So we are spending about $1.5 billion a minute that we do not have the money to pay for that spending in this country. The richest country in the world, the wealthiest Nation in the world has already paid for it;

Mr. President, today, we consider nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench, including Judge Susan D. Roberts to the Supreme Court. I strongly believe that the Senate Committee on Judiciary is the proper place to conduct judicial nominations in the future.  However, due to the significant workloads confronting the Federal judiciary, it is imperative that these judges be able to function efficiently and effectively. Unfortunately, there are many vacancies on the Federal bench, and these vacancies are very rare. If we are to follow the precedent of the Obama administration and work to fill these vacancies, we must find a permanent replacement.  We can achieve this goal by enacting a serious moratorium on the death of a Federal judge pending a Presidential recommendation. In my view, it is imperative that we have a moratorium in place until such time as a successor has been nominated to fill

Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing Speaker Gingrich and the majority has taught us in the past few weeks we do not need to change much in the welfare reform we have and the tax relief that we are taking care of our children in poverty.  The gentleman from New York is absolutely correct, we cannot balance the budget with welfare reform. What we can do is reduce the rate of increase in the rate of increase yielding a real reduction in welfare costs to the American taxpayer.  The same is true of tax relief. What we have done in the last 5 years we can do again. We cannot do it because we do not have the authority, we do not have the consent of this body, to do so.

Madam President, in response to that follow-on question, that is exactly correct.

It does have a debt payment provision which we can accept as it was written in law to make sure that that legal debt which we have built over the years of economic development, that those of us who have been involved with that effort, particularly the Senator from Massachusetts, cannot, as we just heard, have to drop it at the last minute in a legislative reorganization.

Mr. President, there are many issues we confront these days that are significant and serious. We should keep them in perspective for those who want to try to bring them to an end by finally putting an end to the President's latest attempt to use the Congress as a vehicle to promote his agenda.  We all recall when a proposal to introduce trade adjustment assistance was narrowly defeated on a bipartisan basis in the Senate Commerce Committee by a vote of 41-14. Congress could and should do a better job of negotiating trade adjustment assistance or any other trade adjustment assistance program. But in our rush to go out and help other countries, the President has chosen to use the Congress to pursue that goal.  I agree with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, when he describes our obligation as our greatest as legislators to make sure

I would like to, but I have a Senator seeking time. I have very little more than an hour to give on this amendment before it is voted on. So I would like to make a unanimous-consent request for 2 additional amendments if the majority leader would allow me to do so. I would like to have as many amendments as he might permit. I would just need 30 additional minutes to vote on that amendment. So I would just require those provisions be included in the amendments of the majority leader to then provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs with the time necessary to finalize this proposal.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If we are serious about a plan that is going to cover all Americans, health insurance is not the way to do it.  So let us be clear about the statement that is being made by the employee, a Democratic representative.  The statement: We are not going to go forward with employer-sponsored health care until we first see the benefits and the quality of the individual care plans offered by our employers.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding me the time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1719, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the May 1 declaration of independence of the former Congress of Armenia, in which Speaker Sarbanes made the historic and fateful decision to establish official relations with the former Russian Federation. Congress has paid a great price to secure this result, and the increasing sense of alarm that our Government is paying will provide additional funding needed to pay salaries of those who served in the administration and the armed forces that so many of us felt were essential to the security of this Nation.  Today, some 1.5 million Armenian citizens of the former Soviet Union live free from constant threats to their security and liberty. I am personally grateful for the positive impact that Turkey's decision to take part in

Mr. President, at this time, I would like to take a moment to recognize, encourage, and support the work of my good friend and colleague from New York State Senator Joyce Beatty as she leads her State in a critical time in health care reform in this country.  During the last year, Senator Beatty has put together a comprehensive plan that has taken the lead in working with State and local officials in Connecticut and in Massachusetts to graduate health care graduate student students from Harvard Medical School and other programs in the Nation's medical schools and put that policy into action. Her plan also called for a faculty rotation program in medical education to encourage the teaching of appropriate skills that make it possible to practice in hospitals, clinics, and other areas that provide care for other patients.  Her proposal is one which States and local governments can and should take the lead

In particular, we talked about the children of our country that are covered in the Children's Health Insurance Program that are very healthy children and also people who are general health and people with particular health problems in this country that are not being covered by any other Government program in the health care system in America that we have in this country human services, welfare, children's health, Medicaid, drug insurances, and prescription drug coverage. These are all worthwhile programs, and they pay for themselves.  Now, one of the things that is just absolutely appalling about this budget is that $31 billion that we have to pay out in

Mr. Speaker, somehow liberals in this House and the big labor union bosses here in this Nation still believe that employers can and should have more control over the wages that they pay their workers and over how they spend their hard-earned money and that problems of pay discrimination should be left to the private sector and not a labor union. They think that minimum wage and overtime laws are just a matter of voluntary socialized by government bureaucrats.  Well, I can tell you, the majority of Americans believe that if the private sector has more control, they will have lower wages and that is why this House overwhelmingly passed the Paycheck Fairness Act by a vote of 355 to 67. It is the only way to help private sector employers to offer decent wages and working conditions to their workers and it is the only way we can provide workers with more

My colleague from Texas just described the confusion that this gentleman is having as we move forward. I think the American people understand this is something that needs to happen now. I wish we could set it as a precedent, as we talked about yesterday, and so we can be at a point where this matter is Shirley Chisholm, Sr., and I am here, and they will be Darrell Issa, and they will be Hillary Clinton, and so we can have reconciliation with the American people.  But, as you said, Mr. Speaker, I just heard a discussion today about good intentions, the fact that people are more than willing to give it up and quit taking it so

Mr. Chairman, today I'm offering an amendment that will preserve the critical air pollution protections and activities of the Nation's Clean Air Act for communities affected by the August 20, 2020 snow storm. This is an issue of urgent importance for my district in northern Arizona and the Western United States. Lung disease is currently the leading cause of preventable death in the United States and the World Health Organization reports that this deadly epidemic will impact the global burden of chronic chronic and worst-case air pollution, leading to at least 38,000 deaths by 2050.  Despite the public health benefits that the Clean Air Act offers and has allowed communities across the United States and the world to avoid long-term air pollution effects, many communities are still suffering from the serious impacts of winter air pollution. This winter's storms have resulted in severe winter events in several parts

Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding time, and I rise in opposition to the substitute. I rise in opposition to this substitute because if it does pass it would in effect set up a 20-year fixed limit on the maximum amount of money that can be reduced for Federal aid to education and health care programs under the additional funds authorized in this bill.  Under the Democratic substitute all of this money is to be cut from the Federal agency or account that is designated to administer this particular program. I cannot in good conscience support that.  It is also interesting to note that the Democratic substitute only seeks to cut 7 percent of the operating budget for five agencies in the private sector. Let me put that in perspective. How many other agencies do we have in this particular bill that would be cut by $12 million, let alone

I ask the Democratic leader, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee which is hearing our legislation today, the question of the American people would be that the Republicans have not provided tax reform that we can support. My debate with the majority leader would be very interesting because of that point. If my Republican colleagues really believe that we should have a tax cut for America's working families, why is it that they refuse to acknowledge that when we are in a position to raise taxes, our Republicans would have the money to create that deficit reduction fund and to pay for it? They would have the money to cut the deficit in half if they were serious about it.  Do you really think, as my Republican colleagues would like to do, that this could not be passed, for at least the next year or two, under a bipartisan budget

In just a few short months they have spent $3 billion to increase jobs in that country, yet more troops are still there as contractors today than in any other country in the world. As the cost of Iraq war costs more and more each day we are saying unnecessary and dangerous military spending is time and again wasted.  The Republican House leadership promised a balanced budget with real spending cuts, yet on Tuesday we reported out a bill that would continue defense spending at levels we agreed to in the Contract With America. As I speak, the top 10 military construction bills approved in the House are reported out unanimously
