I hope they do because I know this is not being done because you know what you are talking about, the rich here who want to stay in the United States of America and you know they have got to have some kind of a guarantee that if they are going to be very well off they will get that help. So I hope they will come out today and show us that this is a serious and a decent thing to do and that they want to continue to get the kind of welfare reform we want to have in this country and the kind of reform that is going to help some of the poorest people in America get on their feet and be able to take care of their families and pay the rent and buy the house

Mr. President, I rise to express concern about the budget deal that seems to have been hastily crafted for partisan reasons. With the budget deal before us, many Americans would like to get back to spending their hard-earned money on quality health care and providing more opportunities for their families. Unfortunately, this deal is going to leave those priorities for the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the hands of the President rather than the Congress that he will need to sign into law in order to achieve the necessary reforms that will make health care more affordable for all Americans.  Last year the Clinton budget passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support that made health care a priority for our country. Congress passed this bill by a vote of 70 to 22 in the House and a huge majority in the Senate. The plan that was passed by the House and the Senate

I was in the Chamber and heard the gentleman from Texas talk about the amount of money that these funds would be available to give to the State Department and to provide that kind of information to the States which actually would prevent the spread of this particular kind of terrorist organization.

Instead of making the government bigger, we need to right-size government and reform government. Rather, the Democrats have put forward a plan that would have us shrink the size of government and more efficient use of taxpayer money and less likely reform that makes people happy by making Government more efficient. A Democratic plan will reduce Government spending by as much as $10 billion more than the Republican plan which is only $1.5 billion. This is how it would work: The Democrat plan would raise the minimum wage as well as cost of health care by $100 billion a year over a 5-year period; improve the funding of grants to schools for literacy, increase funding for programs that help local governments become community banks and other community development block grants; strengthen the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires a State lobbyist to register as a lobbyist with the State legislature

This amendment would effectively ban the Agency from conducting research into the economic problems in the United States and the worldwide regions where it might be particularly needed. The research undertaken by the Agency is intended to assist in the understanding of the causes of the Great Depression and to better understand the concerns of the public about the economy today.

Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and I have brought this amendment to the floor to ensure that we have Federal funds specifically set aside for the arts and for other similar programs that support the local community and people in America in their community. The bill we have before us today would make it much more difficult for American children to participate in the United States-funded arts and culture programs in Latin America because the administration's budget request would significantly decrease Federal funding for the Nation's Federal arts programs in the United States by $3 billion in the year 2002 and $5 billion in the year 2003. These cutbacks will cripple the Caribbean and South America, including arts programs in places like El Salvador, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua.

Madam President, just to conclude with a few comments in response to those of Senator Dodd that the Senator from California mentioned, she mentioned that the bill I am voting on this morning does not raise an offset for Medicare spending. It is a reduction in the congressional earmark of over $400 million in the bill that is before us this morning. It will result in more than 50 percent of the funds that are cut going to the last dollar of the funds that are saved as a result of the majority having the same approach that they did last year. This is a major victory for the American people, to have not only a clean funding bill but a clean funding bill that will cut spending on Federal programs by over $1 trillion over the next 5 years.  I think it is fair to say that the major program cuts in the legislation

Mr. Speaker, today we are considering S. 418, the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act. If you had asked the average citizen in America whether they think financial institutions should be allowed to extend credit to their own personnel without their permission or consent, you would have heard the same result. For many of these organizations it would not be too difficult to get a ``no'' vote on this bill. This is a bill that calls for the individual branch of our military to establish procedures to restrict unauthorized employees from engaging in high-risk practices that could be significantly jeopardizing their own personal security or the general security of the military. For these reasons we must oppose this bill.  The most well-known instance of this is the military's decision to loan their own soldiers money after an investigation by Congress of the use of a state-sponsored homosexual prostitution organization

Since 2006, New Jersey has added water and wastewater maintenance to its needs at an average cost of $70 million, which is only about a half a billion dollars more than other States and cities.

We have made clear in our report that the guarantee should be a national market if it is to be sustainable and we are concerned that any market action taken by foreign countries which has the effect of increasing the prices of defense exports is clearly in violation of this national market policy. The economic impact is certainly of concern to the Committee on the Budget and it is not the place of Congress to deal with that, nor should it be the place of Congress to give advice or consent that should come with that kind of a policy, particularly when the Department of Defense has no public market policy.

First of all, let me set the record straight and say that President Clinton put the national budget in an unacceptable state in 1993 under President Clinton. His budget did not raise revenues for the Government by 2 percent of GDP. It was designed to try to balance the budget without spending more than was authorized in the treaty that we are going to have here later in the afternoon.

A requirement in a States assistance program that states pay for non-Federal projects is an effective subsidy to the private sector which may be necessary and indeed efficient in some cases but not all the time for all the projects in the program. In a more general sense, the private sector benefits from a given Federal program as an indirect cost for its giving money to the State. While there can be no question that the private sector needs to increase its own efficiency in making use of that tax revenue which has already been received for the projects in the program, the general public as well as the environmental or transportation agencies have the responsibility to reduce any additional cost of those

Let me just say at this juncture we do have several speakers, and I would say that I want to thank Senator Simpson as well as Senator Stevens, Senator Boxer, Senator Hatch, and Senator Obama for their support for this resolution. And I certainly think the McCain-Feingold provision on telephone and television would be a worthwhile step to protect Americans' privacy while in the care of their loved ones. I would also say we are going to oppose this measure because there is something wrong with the McCain-Feingold bill as we know it. But I would hope that the Members on both sides of the aisle could come to the conclusion that this amendment would be a better and more appropriate amendment.  I yield the floor.

Section 116 would prohibit the National Park Service from carrying out boat inspection or safety inspections for boats that come into national parks with a load that exceeds 30 pounds, and has a total motor capacity of more than 150 people or less, at night. Fishing and boating safety and inspection are two important facets of recreation activities in our national parks. Unfortunately, boats arriving in parks without being inspected and safe do not comply with established safety procedures. The National Park Service has confirmed that its inspectors are often unable to verify the inspection status of boats arriving at national parks without that inspection. In January of this year, in response to an article in the Washington Post by Gordon Sanger and Scott Summerfield, the Nation lost one of the only reliable sources of information on boat safety. Sanger and Summerfield have since reported on the issue and identified

Rather, it would require States to prove that those laws are in compliance with Federal law before a similar bill could be enacted into

More to the point, even if we were obligated--which we're not, we maintain export controls on those that are imported for the first time or for the first time, we have a separate program to deal with that and that is where all the money has come from since it was in the legislation. It has not come from the American people or from any other group of Americans to take over the obligation of this country to maintain its foreign currency policy that we have in place. It is a program that has been in place for years. It has not been the use of the American taxpayers dollars to get into this program that it has been in place because the American people have had to take the pressure on not only to make the American Government the business of increasing their taxes but to make the United States the leading tax-paying country in the world.

Mr. President, in our search for ways to eliminate the crushing poverty that afflicts billions of Americans in poverty every year, it is imperative that we address the needs of children and that we address the need for comprehensive policies to address the problem of poverty. The Child Care and Development Block Grant program provides an important opportunity for improving children's educational and health opportunities while supporting working families through the transition to work. The program has provided essential support to over 42 million American children by providing assistance to 1.7 million low income children and pregnant women in our program through a block grant program that provides grants to States to develop demonstration programs to provide health and child care assistance to low-income children, pregnant women and elderly workers. The program was established in the 1991 initiative legislation that was subsequently signed into law, and I was pleased to be the cospons

Senator Cardini and I have argued publicly on the floor of the Senate that without changes to the law we cannot make adequate progress in reducing the welfare rolls.

This bill would not prevent individuals or groups of individuals from forming or joining a defined benefit pension plan to save for the benefit of the pension plan.

The debate on the budget resolution is the heart of the debate and provides the most important opportunity to act responsibly in a way that serves the security of our Nation.  The budget resolution provides for significant spending cuts and tax increases on health care, education, and other important Federal programs. And while we make budgetary decisions for both the Federal Government and the States, Congress must also consider the effects on these programs of Federal spending priorities.  The proposal offered by the Democratic majority includes a modest $76.7 billion budget deficit reduction over the next 7 years. However, I am concerned that this is insufficient.

Most Americans understand the concept of supply and demand, and in this country today, more than ever, there is a rising demand for domestic oil and natural gas supplies and a rising supply of domestic oil and natural gas produced through the public sector and the private sector.  While Congress has passed legislation to create energy efficiency standards to curb greenhouse gas emissions in this country, domestic oil and natural gas production is continuing to rise on a rate that far exceeds that of natural gas prices or natural gas consumption.  According to industry estimates, U.S. production of oil and natural gas is expected to grow by over 20 percent from 2000 levels to 2008 and the United States has the highest domestic production rate of any major country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the great American and Polish hero Casimir Pulaski who served with freedom in this country for the better part of the last century.  General Pulaski came to our Nation's attention after the fall of the Ottoman Empire and after the Americans gained independence from Great Britain and the surrounding nations of the former Ottoman Empire. Pulaski was the first to take up arms against the Ottoman Empire and led an all-star unit of more than 250 troops who captured the capital and forces of the Turkish empire and later won support from the major powers of Europe. His troops made it home safely in a badly battered, but still eager and resourceful American and Polish freezers.  For his efforts, Pulaski was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, was an honorary citizen of the United States and was given

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Mollohan-Shays amendment. I rise to give strong support to the legislation which is before us today. The Head Start Association is committed to maintaining and growing the Head Start Program. The work the Head Start Association has done on the budget and on this measure has resulted in a budget which continues the high standards and improvement the Head Start Program is known for. I know that as soon as a budget is available for fiscal year 1995 the Members will see the difference it makes to the existing Head Start Program and the Congress will have an opportunity to help create a new and better system which will be of benefit to our Nation's children.  In my opinion this legislation which we are debating is the only way we will be able to take advantage of the considerable increases in the Federal program which will be increased in this

Mr. President, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world for a number of years. Many scientists now believe that the flu did more damage to the United States than it did to the British Empire during World War I. Disease outbreaks that devastated the health care of the United States remain a major concern, and today there are around 55 infectious diseases that affect a total of half a billion people in the United States and abroad.  In response to the flu epidemic and the result of its spread to the United States, the World Health Organization and the World Health Organization-United Nations Committee on the Reorganization of the United Nations spread the word to the world of this outbreak. By that time, nearly 2 million deaths and nearly 5 million hospitalized had been observed in the United States and worldwide. The strain of flu that was spreading rapidly was

The Hope National Historic Site has been a more than 50-year landmark to the community and its members.

Those cost increases would amount to a nearly $3,000 increase in Medicare costs in 1996 and $5,100 in 1997 for the

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reaffirm the solidarity between the United States and the people of Haiti in their humanitarian crisis. One month ago, the Haitian people paid the price of democracy in the streets of Port-au-Prince when they exercised the right to free and fair elections and created a government of national unity and accountability with a parliamentary democracy. And today, the people of Haiti continue to demonstrate that they have the will and the capacity to govern without the corruption of the past that has afflicted the country since its return from the 1995 elections.  The people of Haiti deserve a much-needed democratic election to succeed in reclaiming power from the militias and the politicians that have been nearly without equal for 3 years now. And this, for the first time in more than 3 years, Haitian people will be voting in an election in which

Mr. President, once again, Illinois communities are assessing damage from severe storms. A confirmed tornado hit Woodford in March with damaging winds of up to 150 miles per hour. This was followed by a notable series of 1-in-12 catastrophic tornadoes that touched down in three counties in one day in August of 2005, at one point destroying the city of LaGrange and killing one person.  The importance of Illinois in the event of a tornadoes is demonstrated by the fact that just over half of all this year's tornadoes occurred in Chicago. It was this city that is visited by the most of the so-called Chicago-area tornadoes. Mayor Emanuel is not alone in experiencing such a massive volume of tornadoes as a result of a region like Illinois. The National Weather Service reports that Chicago has 1 of every five recorded

This is yet another example of our corporate economy continuing to thrive in the face of difficult circumstances. Wells Fargo did not just benefit from President Clinton's decision to bring our American workers the middle class tax cut. It is very easy for people who support the Democratic Party to say we want to create jobs here in America, but what they really mean is we want to move people out of poverty here in America and help them build a better life for their families.

I can think of no better way to provide insurance for those in need than by supporting repeal of the law that Congress enacted in 2010.  Not only will repeal of this law result in lower premiums and lower taxes, but the repeal of this law will also force Americans to take a step away from health insurance coverage. People will be forced to make these decisions without any consultation from their doctors or their families about how best to prevent catastrophic disease and the preventable treatment of costly illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. No patient should have to make this decision for themselves and should have to get special treatment for their health needs.  For these and other reasons, repeal of this law is the

I agree that we need to reform our judicial system for a better nation. However, I oppose giving the President the authority to defer or prohibit class action litigation that would cost the taxpayer over $2 billion to have brought under the bill.  I would be more than happy to accept a unanimous consent request to temporarily suspend class action laws that would harm our economy, harming our service industries, and harming the people of Illinois. But if this bill fails to pass and is signed into law as rescinded, I would be unwilling to support any legislation that does not include a commitment to consider restructuring our litigation system and provide much needed relief to consumers. I have long been a supporter of the class action reform proposed in H

If that was a problem, it is something that we might want to consider. But the two points that are of particular interest to me are the fact that the city of Chicago says they will not build a new train station at the Argonne site and if you take a look at what they have agreed to do on their side, if they build the station and you put in the station at the time of the next election, the next election there will be a choice between building the station in the area or not building the station. That would mean that taxpayers would have to pay another one and one could have a tax increase on that because the Federal Government will be forced to build the station for an election that was not a right of the community at the time of its decision about whether to build the station for the next election and then to

Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. First of all, Madam Speaker, this language, which is an amendment to be offered by Representative Al Green of Texas, is the product of many months of negotiation and hours of bipartisan work on the legislation that we are discussing here today. It has been a long process for the Committee on Natural Resources and for my party in the House, but it is a good bill for our country and for the people we serve in this institution. We should all support it and do our job in Congress.  The National Park Service said it has a well-earned reputation for providing the necessary support for special interests to lease management of any public or private land through the National Park Service. Yet this bill is a defeat for the people who rely on the park service for the services that they provide to Congress and to the public

So what this is saying is that when the Department has already made the decision that it does not want to have any section 3 general subsidy for future purchasing at the rate of this same amount that is being proposed here, they cannot make any further consideration as to how to get the public assistance that they have not already made for that particular section of the school or that particular county or what it is that the school needs to be able to do in order to provide an even playing field so that all of the children can be properly given the

On this very day in 1905 President Andrew Jackson said: ``From the beginnings of the Republic of Texas to this moment, we have strived with our whole being to effect the establishment of a strong and independent city and state to which the laws of our government were subject.'' This eloquent statement dedicated the opening of the Federal capital city of Washington, DC, on May 3, 1903 to the citizens of the city of Waco, TX. The citizens of our Nation who have been involved in the efforts to form the first city in American history recognize that the hard work of the citizens of our Nation's Capital has been recognized as the first ``New World'' city founded in history

Mr. President, I am delighted that the surface transportation bill that we just passed includes a major tax benefit for small businesses and businesses in the fast-growing small business community in this country and one of the key provisions of this bill is the ability for small businesses to retain more of the tax deductions that they already have in today's tax law and get more of the money that they receive back to help them pay their employees.  That tax deduction has been an important part of the tax laws for decades and, as a result, thousands of small businesses are benefiting from it every year. Unfortunately, the Tax Code also makes it difficult for small businesses to keep some of their tax benefits.  The effective tax rates for the employer-sponsored and employee-sponsored individual provisions of the Tax Code are low, low enough to encourage employers to create

I suggest that the 1998 definition is a little different than the 1999 definition because the 1999 definition will have to be amended if we are to get a 2-year plan and, of course, we have asked many amendments in trying to get this to be on the October 1998 bill as the March 1997 bill was proposed in June 1998. So I would expect that the 1998 definition of the 2000 plan would not be changed in 1997 with the 1 year time period and would be in effect as the March 1997 bill was actually proposed. Would the Senator share with me what those changes are and how the 1998 plan will work under that definition?  iptime A 2004 project at St. Louis University found that this could be accomplished by over 10 months, so it may be important for States to take up

Madam President, most Americans recognize that our continued success in preventing another terrorist attack on our homeland is critical to the security of our country. Terrorists, criminals, and others who want to harm us are still out there looking for new ways to attack our country and the lives of Americans. These acts of terrorism have been fought back against over the past decade by Congress and the administration. In response to that hard work and the good work of our intelligence community and law enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security has increased the number of Border Patrol agents to as many as 35,000. This action was in part due to President Bush's 2007 border security strategy which called for increasing the number of Border Patrol agents at their current level of about 5,500 agents for a full year and doubling the number of Border Patrol officers in the next two years

The fiscal year 2005 farm bill includes many provisions that would help farmers. The administration has proposed cutting back funding for programs that I have been advocating to cut cost in the program that benefits farmers, but these reductions are not binding on the Congress or the President as to how to implement these programs.

As the Senator knows, management has the right to direct employees to do certain things without the consent of the employees and that is something that is going to be very difficult for management to say no to any other employer because management does not want their employees to do things that they think are bad for the business.

That is the ``New Way to Build Health Care Programs,'' which is a Health Care Improvement Program of the United States of America. The funds that have been raised through this program have been used to create a medical research center, to expand access to health care services, to establish new health education programs, and to use that to help educate our next generation of physicians and to develop research technologies that will have a positive impact

Mr. Speaker, before coming to Congress I spent 7\1/2\ years as a circuit court judge for the Federal district court in the District of Columbia and spent 18 years as a trial court judge in a Federal court in the District of Columbia.  I was more involved than most cases in Federal court in a bipartisan effort to change Congress to give the Federal courts a special autonomy that they did not have under the House Act.  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that the implementation of the original congressional intent of Congress in the District of Columbia should be based on issues that are now entirely divorced from the question of which District judges can serve under House rule XXII.  One area of Federal law that has not been addressed by the law and is not being seriously considered is the authority of the District to permit its own circuit court judges to serve on

Mr. President, this amendment has the effect of placing a serious impediment, if not an obstacle to Federal legislation that would cut a deal with the pharmaceutical industry to give people the benefits of modern drugs without having to face the consequences of lawsuits that could come down on the small inventor. We need a deal with the pharmaceutical industry because this amendment could have a catastrophic effect on all of us as we deal with drugs that are drug-free, but it is not a deal that this amendment would put in place that could take the place of a deal for this company. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the remainder of our time.  The mountaintop amendment as it now stands would be unconstitutional. It would set a much higher threshold than we are used to.

Mr. Speaker, the key difference there is that contractors are already covered by Government regulations when it comes to their activities on behalf of the Government, and we are continuing to say that they cannot be there or is that just a limitation that we are trying to change at the same time that we are saying that contractors are not covered when they are actually providing those services to the Government and they are doing them under contracts to a private group of people in the United States of America and they provide those services for a small amount of money and they cannot have their Federal employee identity taken away from them, that is something that we are looking at because it is such a clear distinction here between what happens in private businesses and what happens in a Federal contractor.

They have a great deal of nerve to talk about being short on funds. This is not money for our military. This is money to help the people who build tanks, tanks, tanks.

Second, will we really be saving money by giving that money to some other organization?

These officials, of course, were instrumental in developing programs and legislation aimed at providing protection to women and their families. Not surprisingly, these programs have been overwhelmingly supported by law enforcement officials and many other health care providers and advocacy organizations.  Unfortunately, there is a failure of domestic violence awareness among our Nation's police officers and State and local law enforcement officials, to the extent that many of our law enforcement officers are either unaware or not aware that it is legal to rape or batter a woman and to create some degree of threat to that woman and her safety or the safety of her children

That is why I rise today to call attention to the fact that as we look at what we hope will be our next strategy in Iraq, which is to bring an end to the civil war and a new government to bring an end to this strife and to the efforts by the United States to occupy Iraq in a much less than stable way and to be in a much more stable

The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] and the gentleman from Washington [Mr. Dicks] have worked very hard in making sure that the agreement in the budget has worked the way it should be worked for the public good in America. In fact, in the Senate appropriations bill that has been agreed to by the majority leader and the minority party, one of the things that they have insisted upon as an additional item to be added to this fund for public housing is that it include provisions to prevent evictions after they have been approved by the Federal agency that the funds go to, the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], that are time spent on these problems.

It seems that the Republicans have set aside this amendment on the front of this bill to allow any Democrat that is in the Chamber to read it as if it were in the bill itself in order to maintain that that effort to have the public view of what is in this bill is most important to its effectiveness because it is the effort to have it in the record as it is presented to the American people as a law in order to prevent us from voting in this year's election.

Mr. Speaker, January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, and I would like to highlight a week in January as an important time to raise awareness about this horrific practice.  While the term ``sexual slavery'' is an extremely hard word to describe, I am confident that all Americans can agree that sex trafficking is a very real and serious problem that requires a comprehensive response from all levels of government.  Recent reports have shown that children were being used for sex slavery in more than just the United States. The value of money was often involved as well in the exploitation of vulnerable children.  Sex trafficking is an especially serious issue because of the fact that children are particularly vulnerable to it. This means that they are a potential target for abduction and forced labor by adult sex traffickers.  And in many cases the victims have no choice but to do the work

For those reasons, I have some reservations about the motion to proceed to S. 2739 that was put forth last evening by the Republican majority on the Senate Budget Committee to delay the consideration of this measure until the end of this session of Congress.

How scientific is that? And yet scientists still say that humans should be taken to the next level of consciousness that we are not able to experience yet and those human beings who can are going to have that experience from now on?

We must not allow politics to prevent Congress from passing legislation that helps the public at every stage of the process from our energy bills to our regulatory reform bill to the protection of endangered species legislation to this legislation on clean air and water and so many other important public health

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hoekstra for the leadership he has given on this issue. He has worked with me on many different issues and has done great work to help this important cause.  I am sure all this information that is currently being discussed will lead to some modifications if we move it forward in our committee or any other committee that does have this problem of artificial turf being offered to us by the University of Michigan. I support this and I hope that when they come back here with this proposal we will have the ability to come forward and look at this for what it is and what we can do about it.  I have no doubt that this legislation will be passed by the Senate this year and we will move this issue forward again next year in conference and hopefully will be signed by the President of the United States and move forward into

There is the issue of what proportion of our military would be in the field to serve in the field as opposed to what percentage of women would be. But these are objective factors. They are the American people

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I believe the immediate 30 percent reduction in the Clean Air Act money will have a considerable impact on the State of Oklahoma for example by lowering the total number of cities that can be regulated and reduce regulatory burdens on businesses and on State and local governments. At the same time, Oklahoma City is trying to avoid being regulated by other States and to increase insurance coverage in that city. A number of businesses are all over that city trying to sell and attract businesses and do businesses in that city because of the more numerous regulation laws that are in place. The amendment provides States and local governments with flexibility to regulate and regulate within the public interest or in an area that would further facilitate their communities and create more jobs and economic activity in those communities.  All that we are saying is that that should be

Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing this discussion that the stimulus didn't work. I don't know that the person who said this time and again said that it failed or that it didn't work. And in fact, one of the things that is now coming to the floor of the House of Representatives that does fail is the Wall Street bailout in the first place and all of the public sector bailouts that went on there and when they closed their doors at the end of that time. I don't know that the gentleman who said this time and again did that. If he did, he would know that this country owes a trillion dollars in public debt. So I guess I am not really hearing that he did in this instance in that there was a failure in the first place. So I guess what I am saying is that I am at a loss

If this bill were to become law, we would be able to use the emergency funds from the relief fund for the American people, and all the jobs that would be created by the economy, which will go from 14 to 24 million jobs in the next couple of years.

Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Graham amendment to S. 14, the omnibus bill to help restore America's infrastructure and improve our Nation's health. For too long American States and local governments have suffered under a federally-mandated 12-year fire grant process, where the cost of constructing or repairing bridges, roads, airports, and waterways that carry Americans around the country are siphoned off by inefficient Federal policy.  This bill does a significant amount of good, and while we disagree on every proposal contained in the bill, I believe that we can agree that the highway trust fund is not the appropriate place to cut funding for infrastructure needs. While a two-thirds supermajority to raise revenues through a gas tax is the norm in most other Government programs, States pay on an almost one-to-one basis what the Federal Government

Because she does not have enough money to pay her bills, they have been trying to take it away until she is literally an extended person at this time in time. So what is happening here, again, is that the State just loses its ability to be able to offer a subsidy in that case to ensure that these people will be able to get the help that they need.

Madam Speaker, for the third time this Congress, the House of Representatives is again addressing the needs of our most vulnerable citizens. We have a long way to go in our war on poverty, but we are making progress every day by making programs for those who need them the most--the 1 percent of the population that has been most left out of the success of the federal government. Congress must continue to make these important programs the most popular of all federal programs so they can reach those who most need them for help and their hard work. I urge my colleagues to support the most recent efforts to end the three-tiered State child support enforcement system for poor and working families by supporting the Child Support Relief Act of 1995 in the House today and the Personal Responsibility Act of 1996 in the Senate. With these two new child support legislation coming before

Mr. President, if I could respond to that. On the list we have, there were approximately 85 amendments pending and having been submitted that would have been on the list that went to the distinguished managers, Senator Grams and Senator Levin. As I understand the list, the other two managers have now withdrawn those as well as many others. So this does bring down the number of the total number of those that we can list today and we have the right to do so at any time after we complete the list today and prior to the vote on Monday, September 18, and we will take whatever action is necessary to give those people the opportunity to offer those amendments so they can be voted on. I do not think that we have ever come to this point today with the number of those that have been accepted that are now out there that have been

This amendment is an amendment which is important to the Senator from Tennessee and to the nation. It is critical to making sure that we are having one more debate in this Senate. We are having five amendments this week and many more in the weeks ahead which are related to what the President should do in response to what the majority party is doing right now with regard to this bill to try to gain the confidence and the support of the American people and gain a number of votes so we can get this bill passed so we can fulfill the American people who have sent us to Congress to spend $2 trillion in this Nation to help people in this Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I want to talk briefly about the progress of campaign finance reform through our work in Congress on campaign finance reform this year. We have gone a long time since the last Congress which debated and debated and passed this bill in the last Congress with the President as the leader and the leadership of this Congress as the cosponsors. I am proud that this Congress has passed a bill which will establish an independent commission and special counsel, as well as requiring each Secretary of State to make some individual choices about the manner in which they will spend the proceeds of those very small private donors' money.  That has been the process, at least for the past several Congresses. In other words, Mr. Speaker, we have gone a long time, if you will, from the Congress that debated and passed this legislation to the Congress which

These are two different kinds of bills that can actually be worked out here in the House of Representatives.  We have not really talked about those bills that are on the floor, but we have been talking about those that are not. So, for that reason alone, this debate should be more fair and do more to reach the real priorities that these people have and focus on what we can do to address the issues that they face and what we can do to bring them in line and what we can do to bring them the kind of government that they have been

I think the key elements of this agreement will make it far easier for us to conclude this important work on the next stop in the negotiations. First, it will ensure that our negotiators get what they want from the International Atomic Energy Agency in their effort to establish the basis for a comprehensive regime change negotiation--as we all want to see done.

That is what this bill is about. It is about getting the government out of the house and out of the way so that people can live their own lives and see their own children and their own families prosper in the way that they want them to because, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, families do not live the way we live in Washington, DC, in Washington, DC, with the Federal Government out there just taking their money and putting it in their pockets, without letting them know

Mr. Speaker, that is not the way to run our country and that is not the way to run our economy.

Mr. President, I today recognize the extraordinary contributions of the San Luis Valley, in my State and around the Nation, to the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Santa Barbara Fowlers. On July 8-11, hundreds of thousands of people in the region will gather to watch these birders take to the air to raise money for disaster relief efforts in the wake of Hurricane Ruby and the earthquake that devastated our area in 1991.  The importance of these birders is truly demonstrated by the fact that they often reach far and wide in their devotion to the cause of natural beauty in our region and the rest of the world. In fact, over the past 100 years, the California Deserts have been subjected to an extraordinary amount of stress and strain as the birds have ventured to new regions for the enjoyment of the desert environment.

Madam Chairwoman, there is no question that the rural areas in this country frequently get shortchanged in many areas, and rural America is often left to wonder how to get a commission or how to attract new businesses to their communities because of lack of money. The Rural Development and Food and Drug Administration acts as the most efficient and appropriate mechanism to combat these practices by funding them in this bill as well as elsewhere. But the fact is that there has been a lack of funding for the agencies for several years because of the lack of time to review these rural areas and their needs in particular and particularly the small communities that are so important to these small communities and so important in helping to create jobs in their communities.  In many cases the agencies are focused on working with specific communities or they are not even doing that, and so they do not

Do you believe that 3 hours' notice--you had indicated there were no Republican amendments--would be enough time to put together a Republican amendment to offer and then have a vote on amendments that Republicans could offer in order to dispose of the Republican amendments?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment, but I do salute the gentleman for his hard work on this bill and the bipartisan effort that went into making this legislation possible and, more importantly, the contributions of our men and women in uniform to making this possible. So it is hard to debate what we should and should not cut in our national defense without knowing the impact to the lives and sacrifices of our troops.  This bill includes language that I think is very important to remember and include the full scope of funding for these family friendly end strengths. In fact, the total total authorized level is $1.55 billion above last year's enacted level. However, there are more than 300 active duty families as we speak who would be severely impacted by this bill. The bill simply does not recognize the magnitude of the long-term impact

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1636, a bill that designates March 15 as ``National Wildlife Refuges Day.'' I would like to thank my friend and colleague on the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), and his staff for all their assistance in bringing this resolution to the floor.  Since 1882, Congress has enacted a number of statutes which create wildlife refuges and manage endangered species and natural resources within wildlife refuges. While all of these laws have broad protections for species and natural resources, several more broad regulatory authorities are unique to the refuge system. Some of these federal statutes address wildlife management issues such as predator control, dog patrol, firearms, and other factors that may be novel to individual or family lives

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. ``A deal is a deal if it is not a good deal for the American taxpayers and whether or not it could be cost-effective in terms of providing tax benefits for American businesses and American workers.'' That was an example from a recent law review article that appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education on May 21 of this year.  I would ask my colleagues to look at that piece and also look at the next article that appeared in the Washington Post on July 13 of this year that is entitled ``The 11th Wave of Tax Changes Is Harming America's Business: How a Blocked Route to the Future Will Shrink the Taxbase.''

Madam Speaker, I have sat here and listened to all of this and I have sat here and listened to our senior Members of this body just talk about this particular problem that they believe this bill will solve, but this is a problem which I think most Americans would rather have not been the victims of because there are people out there all over the country that are dying and can no longer afford to have their children go to school and it is being forced upon these children who need help to get that education. I do not think there are many of us in this House that really believe it is just a matter of time before we see another economic collapse as a result of what is happening right now in the United States with our large number of foreign creditors holding some of these money and borrowing it from the United States for that purpose.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Cass Sunstein and his qualifications to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board and chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  Senator Sunstein came to the Congress of the United States in 1979 and became one of the leading voices in the American economic debate in 1979. He became the Secretary of the Office of Management and Budget in 1983 and President of Harvard University in 1984 and became a Commissioner of the Department of the Treasury and General Accounting Office in 1989.  After his service on the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter administration, Senator Sunstein came to work in the Office of the Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton administration as Assistant Secretary for Intergovernmental Relations and Policy Analysis and Assistant Secretary for International Affairs.  In 1991, Senator Sunstein was appointed by President Clinton to be a member

Mr. Chief Justice, I have reached an agreement with the Democratic leader on how to proceed on this measure.

I have talked to the Democratic leader and we have agreed that we will go to final passage on these two measures and that when we finish this one, then I will just offer an amendment to the appropriations bill to deal with the issue of the elections-related bill as it is available as a separate measure because it is critical that we address that

Mr. Speaker, when the Committee on Rules met to consider the rule on this bill, it was the understanding that it would take no action on this bill if the Speaker had not ordered the rule to be laid on the table.  This was accepted by the Committee on Rules as fair treatment for Members whose actions are under the Committee's jurisdiction.  In the interest of expediency, I have laid before the House a printed list of all pending committee-reported amendments and the number of votes necessary to get the House to agree to all pending amendments.  The time constraints imposed on this bill were not intended to deny Members of this body the opportunity to offer and support appropriate amendments to improve the bill.  In order to assure fairness and efficiency to Members who have been obligated to take action under the Committee's jurisdiction, the rules require that each

Mr. Speaker, today I am going to be introducing legislation to stop children from buying tobacco products in the United States of America because of its harmful effects to children and children and children's families. This bill is simply legislation to keep children from buying tobacco products in the United States and it is that simple. Let me give you a little more background on what this bill is all about.  Tobacco has some of the same high levels of fat that some of our children and some of our teenagers consume and some of our children who are in their teens now, many of them kids in New Jersey and New York, have not stopped smoking.  Today, tobacco companies control over 70 percent of the United States market for tobacco products. However, according to the National Tobacco Control Coalition, the tobacco industry still controls the largest part of the market in

Mr. Chairman, the word ``responsibility'' has been raised several times in this debate. I believe that the budget of this House will change its approach to deficit reduction because the leadership has recognized the urgency of deficit reduction as the next generation of this country comes into their time of retirement and the last generation of this country will be in its due time of retirement as we put our country on a responsible course of reform.  If the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Flake] were here today and I were to say to him I could get $1 out of a $15 million budget and I could put $1 in a $15 million budget and not increase the deficit by one penny, if he would have a similar desire, I would agree with him. But I would also point out that our world markets have been challenged by this new leadership and they

I thank my friend for cosponsoring my amendment, and share his concern about the threat of terrorism on our homeland. I look forward to working with my friend on this issue as we debate the FAA reauthorization legislation that has come to the floor today.  ATSID has stated that it believes this amendment is necessary to protect the interests of the United States and its citizens from loss of vital financial and non-financial assistance if we fail to reauthorize this legislation. ATSID also indicates that the Department will work with our Senate counterparts to provide an objective and reasonable update to the bill if FAA reauthorization is not reauthorized in full in the next month or two.  The bottom line is that we should stand by the United States and our security and continue our work to cut red tape so that we can do what

Another matter that concerns me is the recent audit that was performed on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline which I believe is the source of concern to this Senate because this is not a project that is going to be cost-effective because it will be subject to environmental standards. All of the energy in this area has to come through pipeline that is going to require the transportation of thousands of tanker cars and hundreds of miles of pipeline itself and that's why there is concern about this particular project if this pipeline that we have seen is going to be permitted to go forward without that being done. This is obviously going to have to be an environmental issue, whether it is from a liability perspective or any other considerations we have about this particular project that has not been considered as yet by this Congress nor the other body, the Senate has not considered this yet either.

And I want to thank the Congresswoman for her work on this legislation and her commitment to this issue that we put forward last year when the Republican Congress was in charge of the Congress of the United States and that has given this Congress its third year in a row in a year when the Congress has taken so much a back seat to the Nation to a couple of very small communities in the inner city of this country that have really not had the chance to have this good work done to make that

Mr. Speaker, as the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Mr. Gekas and Mr. Clinger, have pointed out, the bill that we are considering today does not reduce the deficit one iota. The bill that we are considering today increases the deficit $6 billion over 5 years and makes the deficit even worse. I think that that is unacceptable. We are now back to square one, back to a time where the debate about jobs and the budget is unnecessary and that we do not need to be involved in this because we are continuing to spend over $1 trillion a year in this Nation on defense.
