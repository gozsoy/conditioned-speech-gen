Now the GOP is taking the position that because this was done for the staff of John Boehner instead of for themselves, the Democrats are wasting time. For example, they say, "The stimulus was designed to give us speed of job development and leave the federal government strong enough to take on the neediest members of our economy." Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said, "The fact is it was just taking money from the federal government to help families and communities

They were the only two per cent of the bill to make it to the Senate floor last week and still are not moving on to the House where it has to be agreed to and it is close to being agreed with Democrat Charlie Baker. The one she offered – a question on how much money the state does to obtain insurance for rural patients and maternity care for low income women – is less protection for those with older parents than either the House or Senate proposal.
