The amendment states that the fiscal year 1995 firefighting activities of the United States Fire Administration shall be conducted in accordance with the current law and existing appropriations and authorities.  The amendment makes a specific commitment to the safety of the American people.  In addition, the amendment establishes an ongoing program of oversight to ensure that all the appropriations contained in this bill for the United States Fire Administration are being carried out in a manner

The Agency will not tell the American people how much this woman earns.  Let me read from an article: The public should have some idea about how much      her salary would be. Because the public has not      received an explanation of the full salary, a Washington      Post reporter took the unusual step of reading the agency's      internal salary disclosure form, which lists the agency's      annual budget.

They have all over this country sponsored it.  The city of Riverside, the county of Riverside, and the State of California have all participated in this program.  So the point of order would not lie.

Mr. Speaker, in just this past year approximately 79,000 pages of regulations were printed in the Federal Register in violation of regulations issued by the Department of Labor and the Federal Trade Commission in an effort to make workers aware of the impact of the regulatory burdens they face. It is estimated that the costs of compliance with these burdens are nearly $3 billion annually in lost wages, lost productivity, and lost productivity of the American worker.  It is clear that the bureaucrats at the Department of Labor and the Federal Trade Commission, for whom we owe so much, are in the wrong. Regulations are costly and they have a chilling effect on the freedom and the opportunity of American workers to participate in the free market. This new, liberalized, central planning agenda for the American people is a recipe for more regulation, less freedom, and more economic insecurity.

Mr. President, I heard a generous discussion this morning on the floor of the Senate about the budget that the Government is putting out to be taken care of. I have always been a little less than happy with that so-called baby budget. I think it is just the beginning of the Government shutdown, I guess.  Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about the baby budget, the one that the President put out on the table. I think that is the one that we are going to have to keep going with. It is the one that has been put out to the American people and the Congress and the President to take care of this Government.  Let me make the point, Mr. President, that I think this Government shutdown has been planned for some time. There are no--it is not a new

Mr. Chairman, I must rise in opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Beilenson]. This is an example of the States offering to reduce their Federal expenditures.  I think it is important to point out that the Secretary of Transportation, in his annual report, testified before the Committee on Appropriations that the Federal Highway Administration is already on track to spend $20 million more on highways in the next fiscal year than was budgeted. This bill, as it stands now, does not even reach that mark.  Mr. Chairman, this is not an attempt to make the Federal Government look good. We are not talking about building the bridges. The Federal Government has no plans for building bridges.  The gentleman from California [Mr. Beilenson] has offered a proposal that would cut over $2

The first is that the Federal Government is not in a position to be able to pay for women who are on welfare because they have to pay for the security of the welfare program that is in place now for their retirement. The Federal Government is not in a position to be able to pay for people who have to pay for their own health care. They have to pay for their own retirement. And the fact of the matter is that they are at the point now where, if we do not fix this program now, in the next 10 years it will take us into the 20th century, and then we are going to have to deal with the whole question of how we are going to fund the retirement of our children.

The most common crimes of African governments include arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, torture, rape, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary killings, abduction, and extrajudicial disappearances. These crimes are often committed by the very individuals who are supposed to protect and assist the poor. The extent of the problem in Africa is difficult to gauge, but the consequences are devastating.  The poor have been victimized by the practice of ``marquee'' land redistribution, a process

Of course we could cut back on the cost of welfare and unemployment insurance by cutting jobs and the American people would say: ``Well, that does not make any sense. That does not make any sense.''  NAFTA was not designed to protect American jobs. NAFTA was not designed to protect American jobs. And when we look at NAFTA we see it is being abused and abused and abused.  The reason NAFTA is being abused is because the U.S. has allowed Mexico to grow to be the largest economy in the world, the second largest economy in the world, and has allowed it to become a manufacturing powerhouse.

Mr. President, thank you. As we heard my colleague from Missouri saying, we have a constitutional responsibility to protect the rights of judicial nominees and the right of the Senate to consider the nomination of a Colorado judge.  As the Senator from Missouri mentioned, I am an original cosponsor of the nomination of Justice John Roberts. He is an outstanding nominee, and I know that his colleagues in the Senate will vote in a bipartisan fashion to confirm him. I hope they will do so without this procedural hurdle that we have set up to prevent any judicial nomination from even being considered by the Senate.  I hope that our colleagues will support the confirmation of Judge Roberts. I know the Senate will be able to confirm his nomination as soon as possible.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This conference report has been brought to the Senate by Secretary of Energy and the administration to discuss the various ways in which they can improve and expand the countries energy security.  While I am a strong supporter of the Energy Policy Act, I believe that the conferees have done a very good job of addressing some of the areas of concern that have been raised by the administration.

The people of Nigeria owe their success in the global economy to a visionary economic plan that has been a success in the short term, but has been a failure in the long term. The U.S. Government has provided more than $15 billion to finance a 5-year economic plan for Nigeria.

So I think it is interesting that the President of the United States would come to the floor and stand there and say that the taxpayers should be penalized by having to pay for the recovery of the people who were devastated by a hurricane, and yet he would come and

Mr. Chairman, clean water is a noble purpose, and the current District of Columbia program is certainly one of the best we have in the country because it does not lose any flexibility to meet the need of the city.  The proposed contract for the District of Columbia Water Supply System, which would be under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, would allow the Corps to construct a system that would meet the unique water needs of the city of Washington. I would like to commend the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Mr. Stenholm, for his strong support for this project and the agreement reached by the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, Mr. Oberstar, and the ranking minority member, Mr. Dicks, to allow the Corps to proceed with this project without congressional interference

Madam President, I once again rise in support of the bill to lift the U.N. arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina and to ensure that security assistance is fully paid for by the United States.  This legislation has been a long time in coming. I have been involved in this effort since the President announced it back in October 1995. I have long been a supporter of this policy, and I continue to be. The reasons for my support have been well documented.  The International Military Education and Training Program [IMET] was established by the United Nations Security Council in the early 1980's to train and equip the Croatian armed forces. The purpose of this program was to promote the ``free and independent development of Croatia as a full-fledged member of the international community.'' By supporting the Croatian military, the United States helped Croatia

It is time to stop it.  This bill has zero effect on the Obama budget, and it has zero effect on the Obama spending or deficit, which the administration and Democrats claim is unsustainable. This is the kind of thing that is unnecessary. This is the kind of thing that should be avoided at all costs.  The bill before us is an extension of the underlying bill, which has been used on a bipartisan basis, because the underlying bill is a good bill. It does not have a lot of merit to it.

Yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office released a new report that has completely undermined the President's health care plan and actually lowers Medicare premiums. Cobra, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, scored the President's plan to create a Medicare prescription drug benefit as $400 billion in new spending. This means that if the President's plan is enacted, seniors will have to pay more than $1,000 a year in new taxes. This is a plan that the President is trying to hide from the American people.

Mr. Speaker, the definition of ``specific selection term'' includes a phrase pursuant to the statute that has the term in it as a legislative term that is intended to be taken as a term of government in that case. So it is the case under the provisions of this law that surveillance, surveillance of a foreign terrorist organization, is a targeted ``specific selection term'' under the act.

It is a little frustrating as we go through Congress when we are so concerned about the bill and so anxious to get it to the floor, yielding and being very respectful of the rules of the House.  I must say that I was a little surprised that the gentlewoman's amendment is to have the committee bill have a preprinting requirement.  I understand that there are concerns about the bill and the Committee on Rules are trying to get it to the floor so we can have a vote on it, but this is an issue that has to be dealt with on a bill that is not before the House. We have been dealing with a bill for 2 months now. It has been brought to the floor on the House floor. We have had debates on it. It has been voted

Mr. Chairman, I would like to pick up on the last couple words that were just made by the distinguished ranking member of the committee and say that we all support educational choice and we all want to have the country that we love as the Nation of opportunity be the Nation of opportunity for the children of this Nation. The chapter in the history of this country is the story of our country in the 20th century where this country allowed women to vote, and I think that was the most significant and the most innovative, important step forward in the history of this country, the fight for women's right to vote, and the tradition that we have followed, that women have always had the right to vote, to participate in the political process.  Mr. Chairman, the Republicans are just saying: No, we do not want that opportunity.

The problem with this is that it increases the cost of care. I think most people are well aware of the fact that it is more expensive to treat a diabetic or a heart patient or somebody with cancer, to treat a child with leukemia, a child with heart disease. It is not just about paying for it.  This increase, in the Medicare part B premium, is going to be $30 a month for a family of four. It will be $100 a month for a family of four. It is going to increase by about $1,400 a year. And this increase is going to have an effect on physicians.

Small businesses are a key part of our economy and we should encourage them to remain active and grow. This legislation will help ensure that small businesses are not penalized by the current low level of tax liability in the Tax Code.  In order to ensure that we have a robust economy and that every American can obtain a job, Congress has taken the necessary steps to assist small businesses. We have extended the tax credit for all family businesses up to $500,000. The legislation we are debating today provides a $500 per child tax credit for all families.

Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, to say that this is not just a false hope that somehow this is going to be misleading to the American people. We have made a real effort to work with our colleagues in the House and Senate to find a solution to the problem of the budget, and I think we have succeeded.  There is no magic number, but it is very clear that we are trying to address the problem. We are attempting to cut the budget deficit in half. We are attempting to balance the budget by the year 2002.  There are people on both sides of the aisle who are not happy with this particular compromise, but it is a compromise. We have the power to do it.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator Harkin for their hard work in crafting this legislation.  The Taxpayer Relief Act will reduce the burden on States and local governments by eliminating some of the unjustified and inequitable tax loopholes that help corporate and wealthy Americans pay little or no Federal income tax. It will provide an immediate, permanent tax cut to hardworking families and will enable them to save more money for their retirement and for their children's education.

The President's proposal would cut the unemployment rate in half.

I want to point out for my colleagues that this bill is very similar to legislation I introduced last year, S. 1, the Consumer Right to Know Act, and which passed the Senate by a vote of 85 to 10 on June 15, 1994.  The Federal court system is overburdened with civil litigants, some of whom have a tendency to file frivolous lawsuits. These cases, unfortunately, have the effect of unnecessarily hindering the efficient operation of the court system and cost the taxpayers millions of dollars. By imposing a time limit on class action lawsuits, this bill will serve as a deterrent to frivolous lawsuits. The bill also ensures that frivolous lawsuits

Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing the Winnett Lion's Club for its many years of service to the lion community in rural and urban communities across the United States and throughout the world through education and education programs for schools and libraries.  The Winnett Lion's Club has always been a wonderful and longstanding partner in promoting education and literacy in the heartland of the United States, and I am proud to be able to recognize the Club on the occasion of its centennial anniversary.  Since its inception, the Winnett Lion's Club has helped improve the lives of millions of children and adults in rural and urban areas. Since the club was founded in 1927, it has grown to a dedicated and active organization dedicated to improving the education and literacy of children, adolescents, and adults in the Nation's poorest communities.  Winnett

I thank the Senator for his question. I suggest that the 1998 definition is a proposed July 2002 definition in December 2001 of the term `` interest rate.'' As I understand it, the proposal in December 2001 was that the Congress would define a ``subprime mortgage'' to include a home mortgage on a ``real estate investment trust or a home mortgage on a building that is a project that is primarily occupied by commercial or industrial use.''  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, most Americans recognize that our continued success in preventing another terrorist attack on the United States is a matter of war and terrorism not of peace and security. Terror attacks terrorize us every day as terrorists plot crimes against us and others around the world. The terrorists have shown us that they are prepared to use every tool at their disposal to cause fear and to harm Americans and other members of our society.  In the years since 9/11, the United States has made significant strides in protecting against terrorism. As a result, since 9/11, there have been more than 30 terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. But these terrorist attacks have also increased the threat of a future attack. There is no doubt that a terrorist attack on the United States would be an act of war.  We need to maintain our vigilance

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to speak in morning business about a provision in the agreement to extend funding for our farmers for 2 more years, the farm bill funding provisions protections for subsidies to the dairy industry.  There is a good deal of interest in the issue of dairy subsidies.  We are a Nation of farmers, and I am proud of the fact that we have over 40,000 dairy farmers in this country. The reason we have so many dairy farmers is because they are able to work on their farms and produce food. They are able to put their own money where their mouths are and make a living out of it.  There are a lot of things we can do to make sure that they can continue to do that. One of the things we can do is to ensure that we are protecting the dairy

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments today to offer a tribute to President General George C. Marshall and the Army Corps of Engineers Corps Commander Colonel Richard L. Sergeant Infantry. General Marshall was born in Logan, RI, on December 3, 1908, to John and Lucille Marshall. After receiving his law degree from the University of Rhode Island, he attended the Rhode Island School of Design and Engineering and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army. He was the first American to command a battalion in the European Theater, during the Battle of the Bulge. He was subsequently commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve and was selected for promotion to the grade of colonel. He also served as the commanding general of the Reserve component in Europe.  During his 32 years of military service, General Marshall commanded a total of 37

Mr. Speaker, the Budget Committee's reconciliation bill is a vicious example of misguided fiscal and social policies which should be opposed and opposed vigorously by the entire Congress and the Nation. Poverty is on the rise and reconciliation is a tool to try to get rid of poverty.  As we all know, the Census Bureau is going to report the poverty rate to the Census Bureau in April of this year. The majority has decided to use the Census Bureau to attack poverty and is making the Census Bureau the enemy. The Census Bureau will report poverty rates to the Census Bureau in April. We should not take that information for granted. The Census Bureau has already reported the poverty rate in 2003. The majority is using the census to attack poverty, as if the Census Bureau had been doing so well that they decided to start reporting it at the end of 2004.

In the United States, if we borrow money from China, we are getting $16 billion in loans. So what happens to these companies that have to pay the interest on these loans? That is the issue.

Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues have raised two questions about today's legislation. First, will the National Debt repay the interest we have paid to the Federal Government for those who have not paid their own share of the Federal Government's national debt that they have asked to be paid to them by their colleagues?  It is hard to imagine a more simple question. What would be the alternative? Would we be able to pay down the debt we have already paid and make the Federal Government solvent? Would we be able to keep the government running at current rates and maintain the quality of services that we have been providing?  This legislation, of course, does not go far enough to answer these questions. It will not pay down the debt, but it will at least stop the interest we have paid to the Federal Government.

Mr. Chairman, the amendment I offer today is modest in amount, but it is significant in its effect on taxpayer dollars and Federal court courts.  This amendment requires that funds be used for legal representation to protect employees of the Federal Government from any civil action brought against them by their employers, such as class action lawsuits, that may be filed by the employee's employer.  Under current law, Federal court employees who work for the Federal Government are required to pay attorney's fees and court costs incurred in defending themselves against an employer's intentional conduct. These employees, who have a constitutional right to be protected by their Federal employment, have a constitutional duty to pay these fees and costs to the Federal Government.  Many employees are unable to afford these costs, and in some cases cannot afford to hire a lawyer. Thus, the burden on Federal employees

The State of California has one of the highest rates of child sex trafficking, with almost 3,000 children reported abducted from their homes every year. I have met with countless families and the stories they tell me about their own families being victimized by traffickers, how these families struggle with the reality of the situation and what it takes to get through it.  I am also concerned that the American public is not aware of the horrendous trafficking that is happening in our country. There is an alarming increase in human trafficking across the country, and I think that we need to do everything we can to combat this scourge. I am committed

It is a fair and reasonable bill, and it establishes a more reasonable standard of proof for drug manufacturers to seek market exclusivity agreements from the Government. It provides that no drug manufacturer may be subject to a prohibition against its entry into the market unless that manufacturer has successfully completed a standard of proof that it is a bona fide, substantially equivalent product for which an agreement has been granted, unless that manufacturer has

Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Graham amendment to S. 14, the omnibus bill that has been introduced today by the United States Senate minority leader and the majority leader of the House of Representatives. This Nation faces enormous economic challenges, including a declining labor force, high unemployment, a weakened capital market, and an aging population.  To address these problems, the Congress has enacted numerous Federal programs designed to increase the productivity and the effectiveness of American businesses. In the 1980's, Congress enacted a variety of provisions that provided tax incentives for American businesses to invest in research and development, to move jobs overseas, and to expand production.  This Nation faces a deficit of $500 billion. For the first time in more than 50 years, the Federal Government has begun to enact significant tax incentives to encourage investment in new technology and manufacturing, new

Climate change is occurring because carbon dioxide is increasing in the atmosphere. It is changing the chemistry of the Earth. It is causing drought, famine, and storms in Africa and the South Pacific. It is the number one killer of small children in the world. We should be talking about ways to fight it. But the Senate should not be doing it in a way that denies the facts.  The science that is already available to us says the rate of increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide is already happening. We have a window here of 30 years. We are not talking about one day. It is not that we can stop it from happening. We

This one will bring President Bush to a close in the coming days and weeks to introduce his budget for the coming fiscal year. This is one of them.  The budget before us, like any other budget, is designed to be an outline for the government to follow, and it is not a comprehensive plan. The President has not given us a specific outline of what he wants the government to do, or when he wants the government to do it. He has not outlined a specific plan for reducing the deficit. In fact, his budget does nothing to balance the budget.  Let me give some examples.

I have been watching the debate here this afternoon. I am a new Member of this House.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in congratulating Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions for their work on this bill and President Clinton for his leadership in this session of Congress and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in passing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  The Clean Air Act is a cornerstone of our Nation's efforts to combat pollution and air quality problems. It is a necessary and laudable tool in our efforts to curb harmful air pollution and to protect public health. It is also a crucial piece of the Nation's transportation system. The American people should have the peace of mind that their air quality is protected and their children and grandchildren will enjoy healthy air.  This bill is a vital first step toward addressing this national health and environmental challenge. In my view, it represents a significant achievement in the Nation's effort to develop

Mr. President, it says: Just a few years ago, before Democrats took control of Congress, Congress passed a health care bill that would have dramatically increased drug costs for pharmaceutical companies and raised the price of prescription drugs.  There was a simple fix: It would have raised the cap on drug prices that pharmaceutical companies could charge each American citizen and taxpayers.  The prescription drug benefit is working. Drug costs are falling. Pharmaceutical companies have invested billions of dollars in developing new and innovative drugs.  The CBO tells us that over the last 7 years, drug prices have fallen 25 percent, and there is no reason why the cost of prescription drugs should continue to fall.

Mr. Chairman, I fear that the sponsor of this amendment has not read the legislation that we are discussing here today because the language in the conference report that we are discussing does not progress in yielding the student loan interest rate reductions to the States and the universities.  Mr. Chairman, I have been working on a proposal for years to provide for loan forgiveness to the public universities, but this legislation does not take the necessary steps to make that happen. I believe it is an abdication of the responsibility of the Federal Government, which is to help those institutions get the loans that they need to get them off of the student loan rolls and into the classrooms.  This legislation does not provide for the flexibility that would allow the Federal Government to pay for the cost of extending loan forgiveness to the public

This bill is not a poll tax on the average American worker and it is not a record of our Nation's wealth and our Nation's success. This bill is not an effort to encourage more of the same and it is not recognition of any part of America's rich history or any part of America's history that has helped the American worker. This bill is about creating jobs for the American worker.  We are talking about an American worker who is not a senior citizen. We are talking about a worker who works at a grocery store, a store owner, a bank employee, a teacher, a plumber, a mechanic.

Hunger has been on the rise for the last several years and programs and resources to address this problem have been underfunded for years and years and years and years. Agricultural subsidies are one of the most successful examples of our Federal Government being insensitive to the needs of poor people in this country.  But when it comes to nutrition programs, our Federal Government is more than willing to subsidize corporate farming. The Food Stamp Program has long been a recipient of subsidies from the Federal Government. In fact, it was established in 1938 to provide food assistance to low-income individuals and families. The first $1 of every $4 provided in this program goes to a very small percentage of the American people. In other words, the Federal Government subsidizes corporate

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1038 introduced by the bill's original author, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), to recognize the protections of human rights and human dignity for persons diagnosed with disorders such as cystic fibrosis.  As my colleagues are aware, cystic fibrosis is a chronic lung disease that causes the lungs to produce a substance called cystic fibrosis airway disease. The airway diseases of this disease include bronchiolitis obliterans, bronchiolitis obliterans obliterans, emphysema, and emphysema obliterans. Cystic fibrosis airway disease affects approximately 4,500 people in the United States and is the second leading cause of death in the United States for adults and children

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. ``A deal is a deal if we can find future tax cuts that will spur growth and create jobs for the next generation. It is not just highway projects or tax cuts for the rich that do this. When we ask Americans to pay more in taxes to fund more government, we are telling them that the government will have a greater role in the lives of their children and grandchildren.''  Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes a fair balance between protecting and strengthening our Nation's transportation infrastructure and maintaining fiscal responsibility. It will ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to finance more government and it will ensure that we keep America's priorities in mind when we develop transportation projects.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

He has been an advocate for all workers, including African-Americans and women, and has fought for fair labor laws and protections.  He is the co-founder of the Center for Work and Opportunity, a conservative think tank which has focused on how the Government can promote economic growth and social justice.

Mr. Speaker, today I am going to be introducing legislation to stop children from buying tobacco products on kids sites such as Banco Ameritrade, BBVA, for free.  Banco Ameritrade is a private company that is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and is owned by a number of government officials. Banco Ameritrade has agreed to limit its advertising to parents' homes and schools to target its advertisements to children.  While children in the U.S. are using over 30 percent of all cigarette packages, according to the Consumer Federation of America, BBVA, the largest retail cigarette manufacturer in the United States, is advertising exclusively to children.  The FTC has taken action against Banco Ameritrade because the company has allegedly violated the FTC's advertising guidelines. The FTC also says that Banco Amerit

I thank my friend for cosponsoring my amendment, and share his concern about the threat of legislation that would repeal protections for protections of human rights that protect the faces of religious minorities that must be protected under the amendment.  DHS has already taken several steps to address the concerns raised by the amendment.  The Office of Inspector General issued a report in April 2015 that found that DHS lacked sufficient information on the religious and cultural practices of the contractors and subcontractors receiving funding under the section 702 program.  DHS has issued guidance on how contractors should treat religious and cultural minorities, and clarified the appropriate response to claims of discrimination.  DHS also issued a directive in October 2016 directing that employees should use the term ``religious'' or ``cultural'' when using the term ``religious practice'' or ``cultural tradition'' when reporting to a DHS officer about a

Mr. Chairman, I would like to explain the content and purpose of this amendment, which is offered to provide assistance to businesses that use or plan to use coal-fired electric generation. I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] for his gumming up the works.  The amendment is aimed at improving the Department of Energy's coal-fired electric generation programs, particularly in areas that are highly susceptible to increased coal costs and decrease in demand. This amendment will allow the Department to make available funds to address this problem.  I am pleased that the Department has already taken steps to address this issue. The Energy Department has developed a plan for coal-fired electric generation in the Southeast, which is in its infancy. The plan has the potential to significantly improve the availability of coal-fired electric generation in the region,

It is also an opportunity to support small businesses in the American economy. This is a good bill.  I would just like to make a couple of points.  The first point is, we know the bottom line is that our small businesses are suffering, our small businesses are having to compete against all kinds of other countries. So we are going to do something to help them, to provide the tax incentives to allow them to compete. We are going to make sure that we make it easier
