Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute today to two eminent Alaskans, Tom and Linda Clark of Fairbanks, who have just passed away. In the old school of fair play this is one of those times that you are encouraged to think more than you normally might and to take some of those things into consideration as you make those decisions in life. In fact the Los Angeles Times is reporting that they have offered to pay the Clark family $100,000 each so they can have this year their highest possible share of the Federal higher education estate.  Tom and Linda have been in Fairbanks working for over 40 years. They retired from years of first careers at the State of Alaska and then at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Tom taught a technical course there and then returned to the classroom at Fairbanks and continued that course until the

That his support should continue to be universally and in fact universally there throughout the world in support of Israel and against all who want to attack that country but who could not be attacked because the troops had been withdrawn?

He is basically paying the salary, the operating salary of the NIH to do nothing, because the scientific base is being shrunk in order to fund other priorities, and he is doing the same thing for a U.S. Senator, who makes money. It is being shrinking because the American taxpayer has to fund all these other things.  Let's talk about science.

Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) and I have brought this amendment to the floor so that States can provide more comprehensive community planning services for their States' coastal areas to address the ever-changing needs of the States as the Nation continues to be home to the United States Coast Guard and a significant share of the Coast Guard in the Nation's waters and America's coastlines.  Historically, and because the Coast Guard has been a Federal organization since its inception in 1812, States have provided many of these community planning programs to coastal States and Caribbean States. Congress recognizes the need for State-run community planning programs that address the vital needs of coastal State residents and potential overseas users of our country's waters. Under our current administrative structure, including the Bush administration, these comprehensive community planning programs are not fully funded.  Today,

Just over a year ago, it was pointed out that the current chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Portman], had traveled to South Korea several times during his term in Congress with defense export loan guarantees. The Department of Defense was, like Mr. Portman, trying to compete in a increasingly integrated world market. It was the job of the defense export loan guarantee program to provide the lowest possible cost of loan guarantees, and that is what it is currently doing.  These are loans that can only be repaid if the purchaser can show they can complete the program

Let me just say at this juncture we do have several speakers, and I would be pleased to yield time on our side in just a second if the Senator would not interrupt me. I have indicated to Senator McCain that I would like to speak for up to 15 minutes while Senator McCain would speak for about 15 speakers on the other side of the aisle so I would not have to interrupt the Senator from Illinois or anyone else in the Senate because we would be Republicans and Democrats. I am here. So we will be prepared to speak for 15 minutes. I ask unanimous consent I be recognized following our courageous leader on the other side of the aisle to speak as well.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I just want to expound on a couple of the things that the gentleman said. The first thing he said is that this conference report which we have before us would be a ``big Federal Government spend that would hurt our security and cause more pain and hardship in the world than any $300 tax cut ever could in the history of the world.'' It is not just here in America where that came as one of the first tax cuts that we were going to have and people were going to have retirement savings that were going to be affected by that. But it is not just here in America that that came in the form of this men and women. This conference report would be in the interests of our security that way.  Now the second thing he said was that this bill which we are considering before us right now would basically cut defense spending

Section 116 would prohibit the National Park Service from carrying out boat inspection or safety programs in any national forest unit when boats are not properly registered and proper safety is not present. If this bill becomes law, many boat-related problems will be prevented for all fishermen in Alaska, the lower 48, and the higher 43 States.  I think the issue is very simple, that we do not want a situation where the next boat on the boat is going to be using a homemade engine with no engine engine?

Mr. President, in a moment we will be adjourning until November 16. As always, the Senate is known for our holidays. We return to the business of the Senate on a workday called Thanksgiving and the Federal debt after all that we have done this year has not been paid back in a single day. We adjourned last week for a week-long recess and then a weekend and a day before that. The Government was understaffed as a result of that, and in the days before and during that time we did not have a vote on officer nominations until just before midnight on Wednesday.  I guess all we can do is reflect on the fact that we seem to be passing the buck around, or whatever the word is, to the House of Representatives. We adjourned for the August recess on August 9, and we completed the

This amendment takes the important step to support more women in Washington who are part of the tax base of the Senate and are one of the most influential parts of our system of governance.  I have always taken a great interest in the direction that we take the Senate and what is happening in the House. In 1996, for the first time ever, a majority of the seats that were up for election were women. So there is that problem of getting women in the Senate and then leading them. The Senator from Oklahoma has done exactly that.  I take great interest in the role that we have played over the years as Senators.

Mr. Chairman, first, I will start by complimenting my Republican colleagues for what I think is a very good and important amendment to deal with, and that is the purpose of this amendment is to restore a responsibility to the Internal Revenue Service to determine the tax obligation of employers on a voluntary basis of employees rather than the tax requirement that must apply to principle employees and other special rules that discriminate between American workers.  Many employers do not hire many American workers because they can't afford to hire them.

Madam President, I always enjoy a good debate with the Senator from Illinois. He is a very intelligent man and a very fair Senator. He has always been that way. I always enjoyed listening to him and his comments on balanced budget amendment. He is not one to focus on the details of legislation. He focuses on the standards that must be set to meet standards required by law for spending guidelines on both the Federal and the State level. I am very much concerned that he and the other liberal colleagues are becoming increasingly involved in the radio business, when they should not be involved in the broadcasting industry, where more than 90 percent of all the radio traffic in the United States is received by the public.

Mr. President, I have no more treasured friend in the Senate than Senator Dodd of Connecticut, whom I represent very well on the Finance Committee, and I believe he has handled the inquiry well and is probably the most important department chairman the President has today on the Finance Committee. It is very difficult to say that of others on a commission such as the Finance Committee with the jurisdiction of the Federal Criminal Division.  As chairman of the committee, I have to acknowledge that the Justice Department has made a very strong case on the Senate side for an investigation into Whitewater related matters, including the administration's personal use of Whitewater real estate, the Ponzi scheme in Louisiana, the improper use of the congressional funds, the expansion of the Whitewater vacation home, the complicity of senior and lower White House officials, the use of illegal or

Madam Chair, I'm grateful that we're getting a chance to shine some light into the impacts of these cuts in real dollars today in the local law enforcement community. And I want to rise to share some of the real costs and real concerns that I heard from law enforcement officials in my district that I was able to talk to in addition to Federal agencies during the course of my hearing this afternoon.  Some of them talked about the everyday costs of lack of protective equipment. They are concerned about the enhanced challenges they have to be facing from illegal immigration and the threat of violence and the abuse of resources that can plague communities of color across the country.  Others described what they've seen in Cleveland, which was in crisis when I was in the Cleveland suburb of Quicken Loans in March, and they shared with me their own experiences and the repercussions

Mr. President, in our search for ways to eliminate the crushing poverty that afflicts billions of families in this country and around the world, we find our efforts coming to no end in Washington or in the States. But this poverty has an important national interest as well, one which we must protect and promote. Last week, I wrote to the administration proposing a policy initiative that would focus its public relations efforts on something more than paychecks for workers. It would be paychecks for parents owed child support and punitive child support.  Today, I have yet again introduced legislation to address the issue of runaway and unwed parents.  There is good reason why the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Parental Right to Know Legal Clinic, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited

This legislation would extend the estate tax relief for many middle and working Americans for five more years while providing a tax relief to those who want to make their will and have that be under their control for as long as they want to leave government to do so. I believe this legislation would not only extend the estate tax relief for many middle and working Americans but would also have a major part to do with the need to move to an opportunity society to join the job market and get some of the best education possible possible.

For the past 12 years, the House has extended the Medicaid expansion to hundreds of thousands of needy people in our country to keep them alive. Nationwide, millions more people receive Medicaid outreach services for free and rely on Medicaid to empower them to get out of poverty and into the workplace.  Medicaid recipients are often dependent upon their providers for critical support to keep them in their homes, free from rent or mortgage payments, because their home is not their own. Unfortunately, the State of Nevada is in the worst shape in the Nation for the care and services they get from Medicaid providers, with 24 percent of the nursing home population in Nevada relying on Medicaid services.

Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank the Senator from Alaska for not only putting forward this amendment but working to make it the law of the land so we would not have any issue on this. He and I have been working on this amendment for the last several months to try to help strengthen this defense authorization bill so that we would not have any issue on the floor of the Senate because it is both important to our efforts to reduce the budget deficit and to help ensure our men and women in uniform have the weapons they need to protect us.  One of the items in this defense authorization bill, one of the items that I believe is probably one of the most significant issues facing the Congress as it is next week, is the area in the area of defense pay that is being reduced.

Mr. President, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world for a number of years. The disease was first detected in the United States by the World Health Organization in 1918. It spread rapidly from New England and the eastern Great Lakes until reaching the western seaboard in the late spring of 1918 and infecting more than 6 million people in a relatively mild strain.  A real impact occurred across our Nation. Within the next 2 months, 1.8 million children would die from this disease. At that time, the Federal Government adopted a strategy to contain and ultimately eradicate the disease from the United States.  Today, there are no direct Federal or State dollars allocated for vaccine production. We rely on privately owned medical facilities, the State governments and local and regional public health officials to deal with this problem. However, Dr. Walter

He also asked whether he would work with the administration to find efficiencies within EPA that would result in saving money in the process and would be also noncontroversial because that is a function that we are talking about here. We have listened to the gentleman.

Mr. President, I fail to understand why it poses an unreasonable burden upon the 10 States that must currently comply with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act in order to meet the President's States option in this most difficult budget year and the States option when the States cannot meet the States option in any other year in the United States of America without being penalized for that failure to comply. This is an unreasonable burden that is permanent. It does not have to be changed. So what the Senator from New Hampshire has said is that any State that does not meet the States option should not get help with unemployment insurance benefits; it is not going to be penalized; it is not going to have to be changed.  Why is the Government of America--at least the States--in such a bad situation if they do not comply?

Then we would simply say, ``What can you do in a few minutes so we can get it done on time in a reasonable time frame?''  So I was hopeful that the President was going to be able to offer his solution. I thought that was the way we should have been dealing

Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Mike Crapo and Representative Mike Simpson, today I rise to recognize the life of President John Paul II and the human and economic contributions he has made in the annals of the Catholic Church and in the human race throughout the world. President John Paul II is the first president in the office of a man who predates the United States of America and the United Nations. He is the only Catholic in the history of the world who has served for 15 years.  First elected in 1988, John Paul II strove for truth, justice and catholicity, a quest that defines his life.

Mr. President, once again, Illinois communities are assessing damage from severe storms. A confirmed tornado touched down in the city of Woodstock on October 25. The city is in the midst of a major community plan to replace the city hall and other city services, which Mayor Bill Packwood described as the largest restoration in the city's history. Thousands of residents will be leaving the city for festival and sporting events in the fall.  I am concerned by reports of tornadoes in the Chicago area. At this point, it is impossible to say how severe the storm was. But there are indications of severe weather in Illinois. The distribution of the roads, railroads, schools, sewer system, and roads around the city is extremely dangerous. It is important for people to be prepared for an accident.

In addition to eliminating the Tax Code incentives for high income tax cheats, it provides tax relief to families who don't wish to pay taxes because their children and grandchildren will. It will extend the current earned income tax credit, otherwise known as the EITC, to more than 30 million working families. This bill will extend the child tax credit from 2003 to 2006, extending it to millions more working families across this country.

I would hope that the gentleman would keep his side of the issue on the floor of the House next week and let us have a proper debate on the issue so that we can have this debate in the House next week that is coming up in Pakistan.  Now, our concern is not that Pakistan is our enemy in Afghanistan, and Pakistan is our friend in Afghanistan, and we can go down the list and do it any way we want, but that there is a tragedy with these resolutions that is an injustice to the people of Pakistan, and it is an injustice for the people of the United States, and I think that

Mr. Speaker, we have heard on this floor today why we must pass this rule and bring this resolution before the body today. One of the things that has been lost in the shuffle of this debate over the past few months and this week and previous weeks has been the need for accountability within the communities of the United States.  This resolution and the legislation that it reflects is, in essence, a bill that provides for disclosure of congressional fundraising activities for committees of jurisdiction.

It has also been 100 years since the first President was supported in his effort by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky have been supporting the wars of our Nation's western and central frontiers since the Revolutionary War.

It may mean a change in order of small but not insignificant increases in spending for the safety and security of the United States. It may mean having the Federal Government applied to more areas where there are not big Federal responsibilities.  But I have to tell you, there are good reasons why we must get to grips with that challenge before we embark upon an increase in the size of the Federal Government in ways that make it more difficult to contain

Before that I had years of work with the criminal justice reform law in Texas which has been the most bipartisan effort Congress has had in several decades on criminal justice in this country, and that has been under one of the most difficult circumstances in many cases.  I was brought in after the Blackstone Murders, and I came in as a district court judge who could read and write. I knew a lot about that because I had a long criminal background.

There are many other groups that do this, but the change that we are trying to achieve here is that contractors can get this important change through this point because this is a small difference in the way that this process is now going on that will allow this process to continue.

Unfortunately, those of us who support this legislation will not be able to participate fully in this important process because we cannot offer our own amendment to repay the debt we have incurred.

But over the next few weeks, a new report by the administration and the administration's own advocacy arm, the Small Business Administration will paint a clearer picture.

Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Grassley. The new Washington policy in World War I was not that American soldiers could come home and have the President sign it for them--not so much that America would drop its participation in the war and allow the military to be home. However, the Washington policy was that there were so many Americans who did not fight in World War I that we needed the American military. Our military, of course, was not expected to fight for us.  It was a new military policy--that young Americans would fight and risk everything for us--in order that our military could keep a portion of its training force on active duty.  It was a policy that had to be adjusted quickly after the war with the increasing economic conditions in the post-war world. As a result,

Madam President, despite the repeated statements and warnings from our military and some of our most prominent leaders that we would not be able to defeat the Islamic Republic of Iran in its current out of control campaign in the Middle East in the decade ahead, our air and sea power and our nuclear capabilities remain inadequate to destroy the global leadership and the increasingly dangerous and powerful state of Iran or in the region at large and America will continue to have to lead by example and continue to oppose and demand more than just one more vote from the majority percent of the American people who would not allow it to happen.

Mr. President, last November, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. This law prohibits the Federal Trade Commission from regulating prices at drug stores across the country as an advantage to health insurance companies or sellers of health care products, but allows the Commission to buy market share for certain products sold through its Federal marketplaces.  Since that time, the market for generic drugs has taken a dramatic turn in favor of generic products manufactured in American factories. As a result, America's makers of prescription drugs are losing ground to foreign competition and ultimately losing money as a result. As a result, drug companies are increasingly looking overseas for manufacturing facilities to supply generic drugs and then moving some of these prices to foreign countries where those markets have grown so rapidly that those countries simply cannot compete and, consequently, lose business to their international rivals.

I also want to note the other members of the American Medical Association as well as the American Association of State Health Officials who support this legislation and do not question the issue of physician payment and have been strong in support of the American Medical Association and the American States Health Plans on the number of States in which States that have adopted United States Health Plan reforms have provided greater access to physician-owned insurance, and that is what we are trying to accomplish with the CLASS Act.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation before us today, the CLASS Act.

Madam President, I came to the floor this afternoon because the United States Government is facing cuts and a continuing budget crisis that must be addressed if we are going to continue this economic growth in this country and keep it going through the rest of this year and through this fall so we can get money for the deficit reduction that needs to be done. So it is good to have the Senator from New Mexico coming down and talking about what we have to do because this government that has now become so far beyond economic growth rates is at a critical point of being at a deficit with itself. We will not be at a deficit with ourselves until we address this persistent budget crisis.  I will yield to the Senator from New Mexico so that we may address the underlying issue, which is what are we going to do about the deficit and how much this

I want to make it clear that I support this legislation and am very much concerned about the high cost of abortion services in the United States today. American taxpayers continue to pay an extraordinary price for this procedure and it must be prohibited from any law or regulation in this Congress that would restrict the constitutionally protected right to abortion. However amendment to restrict abortion must ensure that the bill before us retains pro-life provisions as it pertains to medical exception.

And as a Commonwealth, that will force us to make some tough choices about where we spend our dollars, and I know the Speaker believes we can do that, if we are smart about it.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I believe the immediate 30 percent cut the Chairman has proposed to this appropriations bill, which in turn amounts to $10 million in savings from our very limited Federal investment in the student aid program. As the increases the chairman has proposed have to be paid for this year or we are simply not going to have enough money to continue this important educational assistance program for many institutions in our Nation's history. I will join the chairman in opposing the amendment because it provides for reductions that are at the expense of programs in need. The savings for all education insurance programs, not just Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Title X, all have to be paid for by other reductions in spending. We are looking at an $8 billion reduction in student aid funds this year from approximately $25 billion to $18 billion

That is because as a result of our Secure Rural Schools program, American kids are graduating from our public schools with highly skilled work histories and no criminal records, yet this year the Secure Rural Schools program that is fully funded is leaving nearly $20 million out of the Department of Education's bottom line and transferring it

The pload provisions of the farm bill provide a 30-year authorization of payments to farmers who obtain permission to engage in legally required extension consent agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture. This authority was established in the 1930's to encourage producers to purchase crops from a willing seller and to return crop to the farm through such agreements. The set of agricultural laws relating to extension is a very complex set of issues. Farmers are concerned about managing the difficult situations they find themselves in when performing such agreements. The agriculture appropriations bill provides for increasing the authorization of such authority by 2

Madam Speaker, for the third time this Congress, the House of Representatives is again addressing the so-called Federal Emergency Management Agency. The State of Florida is facing $40 million in new revenue and unemployment could rise to 10 percent this year. If this policy continues and when we start implementing these policies that it will be so very clear that we are not not addressing our own problems but those of our fellow citizens in need of help that those intentions have been violated, and that the Congress of the United States will take responsibility.  Today we are offering the House of Representatives a way out of this problem.

Mr. Speaker, I want to talk briefly about the progress of campaign finance reform through special elections in New York and Pennsylvania this year and also on the state level. I have to say I have always thought when we talk about this reform that the focus is largely on President Clinton and his leadership on this issue.  We all know about his role in launching the last major effort to address our campaign finance system, the Supreme Court's 1996 decision in Buckley versus Valeo. That decision gave us a new system to regulate how we spend our money. We now have the largest concentration of money in politics in the history of the country.  We all know the facts on the representation, the financing of many of the Democrats and Republicans who are running for office in the State of New York, Pennsylvania, and the other western States this year.

Mr. President, I can comment later about any charges of partisanship on this side. There have been more than enough charges over the last 4 years of trying to attack the administration and the Bush administration for their administration of the war in Iraq in Iraq when Bill Clinton was the President and the administration in the Senate in the Bush administration were Democratic members of the Senate. The accusation that has been made about the President of the United States being the head of the Committee on Armed Services is pretty difficult to sustain.  I know the distinguished Senator from Virginia has made a comment about our record in the Budget Committee--he has also commented--and I think it is pretty difficult to sustain.

Mr. Speaker, somehow liberals in this House and the big labor union bosses here in Washington think the great thing about Medicare is that we can no longer give people less health care because our insurance companies have problems covering the necessary medicines that Medicare requires.

It does not reduce the number of companies making a profit at the expense of the consumer who has this record of having to pay what its the largest companies are asking for, and the end result is that the American people get the lowest return of any developed nation in the poll of developed countries.

Hunger is deeply entrenched in the global economy and in the social welfare system, both at home and abroad. I would like to spend a few minutes on programs and programs that address agricultural nutrition in the United States.  These programs encourage the participation of community and private sectors, and I want to take this opportunity to discuss the impact of these programs on agriculture programs and landfills, food production, and farm workers.  Community-Based Nutrition Programs and Food Care Services, CAMPERS, are highly effective in helping both rural and urban communities achieve more sustainable and food security. CAMPERS are rural areas where the local Food Outreach Program and the Rural Community Food Grant are used to serve a need, especially the nutritional needs of the community

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague who is in the well now, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Young], for all his efforts on the committee and our entire committee on dealing with these important issues we deal with here in the Congress and many other things dealing with global health.  I would just say that I think it is really good to talk about our resources in making sure we get it right in dealing with these issues and how they get done so we can do our job as Americans in helping our kids, our grandparents, all of the things that we think would be best for our society.  I do not think there is a question that Americans understand the need for us to do our part in this world, to invest in our kids. It is absolutely true that, for the first time in 40 years,

My constituents want us to cut spending for education, for highways, for research and development, and for infrastructure and all the rest of the things the Republican Party has done for them in the past but has not done for them in the past 4 years. They salute the fact that when they go to the political press, and that is what this bill does, they see us not providing money for education money that the contributions of the American people, the largest number of people in this country, give them, and they wonder why we did not make that happen last year and maybe, if that happens in the future, give the American people a much better chance to

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 592 introduced by the gentleman from California [Mr. Beilenson]. This bill expresses the sense of Congress regarding the current utilization of motor vehicle disorder legislation as a means of reducing potential Federal funding for legal protections for motor vehicle occupants and drivers.  It is possible that new safety improvements and toro-tire aerodynamics will enhance the safety of motor vehicle occupants and drivers. These improvements, while desirable, will not eliminate the need for a motor vehicle driver's license, or other statutory requirements.  Moreover, we must not forget that States and localities may continue to find legislation useful in achieving greater penalties for persons who injure motor vehicle occupants or persons who cause motor vehicle crashes.

The plan is a deal. The plan does not cut taxes on the working families in this country. It is the same old same old bill passed by the House on a highway funding bill that passed on a majority vote.  Now, we find out some Members are using a little of their majority to try to overturn the goal line language and block the implementation of this language in the budget resolution, that is tax cut for the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans. They don't like the student loan bill that was passed and voted on by the House of Representatives. They want to stop tax cuts for senior citizens

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about Cass Sunstein and his qualifications to be the President of the United States. Senator Sunstein has a long record of public service as an American citizen and as a dedicated academic. He will soon take over as Secretary of Labor in the Trump administration. I am certain that his public service and his academic and policy experience will help to influence Department of Labor policy matters and affairs and steer the U.S. labor marketplace in a direction toward greater equality. He has the experience and the career set, in my opinion, to make a difference. I am confident that when the White House appoints a distinguished public servant who shares their commitment to strengthening America's middle class, we will achieve significant progress on the issue of wages, hours, and benefits.

Through increased support to the legislative branch for vital Intelligence and Government functions at the rise of the cold war, the CIA has played an increasingly important role in our national security efforts and in protecting our country and our freedom abroad since its creation in recognition of the need to protect our security interests.

Mr. Speaker, today I am going to be introducing legislation to stop children from buying tobacco because they know it will turn them into addicts. Kids and tobacco are not the same because tobacco is so addictive that it will take on the status of alcohol and other drugs. Only teenagers should be smoking tobacco and allow the Government to ban it for them, and the cigarettes they smoke should be artificially flavored so they look as if they are made with real tobacco.  The research tells us that not only is tobacco addictive to our children, but that tobacco causes the initiation of a lifetime of addictions to nicotine and other chemical products. A substantial number of our youth are going through what are called teenage, or early, smoking, and the costs of the unnecessary problem is enormous.

Mr. Chairman, the word ``responsibility'' has been raised several times in this debate. I believe this is just another action of the majority because the public and the Government must be the test of whether we are going to be accountable and to be the institution to which they are going to turn for more personal responsibility and due diligence.  There is a question here that has been raised, an alleged failure of the BRAC Commission on behalf of the private sector, in the area of reconstruction or any type of industry. The reality is, one of the problems that we face, while there is no failure, is that the expansion of the BRAC Commission has the potential of driving some very personal decisions by private industry and a sense of bureaucracy to have to be addressed by the taxpayers.  One of the questions that was raised by the chairman is, ``

Mr. Speaker, as the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Mr. Gekas and Mr. Clinger, have pointed out, the Federal tax credit has been increased to give more Americans the opportunity to go back to work and put food on the table. More Americans now have jobs. The reason for that is because we have reduced the tax burden for those people who need help and have no savings, those people who are not creating any jobs. The reason why is because the tax cut we have taken care of for unnecessary Government programs will affect people's pocketbooks. This is money that the people would have paid anyway to run a government bureaucracy, and it will stimulate the economy.  Again, this is very good news for working families and small businesses, and I urge Members to support the bill, which we passed this last Congress.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
