They have already written that out for us because they know it is so bad they cannot get a committee to come out with a report that will move on to the floor to be voted on by the House of Representatives and get a bipartisan report from the Committee on Appropriations as we go through the appropriation process.

I want to say a few words about what the bill is and what the problem is as it now stands today.  The bill is called the INFORM Act and the legislation as it now stands is just called the Adam Walsh Smith Act because it is the only effort at Government control over the Internet that has not been under the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

There are some who say that that budget deal is not so bad because we have the spending cuts in it and the tax increases in it that will probably come with it but I would argue that any time we agree to a budget deal that has the spending cuts in it but there are no tax increases that is bad because the spending cuts would have to be paid for if they are to be paid for and, therefore, we should avoid that discussion because the American people do not support the tax increases of this Congress.

This is what we all voted for as Republicans in November of 2008. Now is not the time for the Democrat majority to change that and give a bigger government by definition. We need to build a smaller, more accountable government so that people here in Washington, D.C. have the tools they need to be able to run their lives without having to worry about regulatory riders that make it difficult for American jobs to be created here in this Nation.

While I strongly support the President's request to begin construction of the Alaska Highway system in North and South Dakota, this process is far from over. Our region already has nearly 400 miles of new and expanded highway roads built during the post-cold-war era in this country. The public sector will continue to build infrastructure in this country and the private sector will continue to finance the project, which is only fair. With all of the Federal expenditures we are facing, the private sector will have to shoulder the burden of paying for roads in order to sustain the existing infrastructure we have and the next generation of Americans will rely on in order to continue their jobs in the future.

That way we can give it some attention.  The hews were confirmed last night. That means we can complete action on this bill today.   dress is tight,

Arafat is friends with President Clinton. President Clinton and I spoke many times in the years following the Oslo agreements.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, let me first and foremost urge Members to vote ``no'' on the rule and on this amendment because it denies Federal employees the right to vote as Members of Congress because they have an issue that they have decided not to allow them to vote on in a political forum but instead in a national debate that is brought to us by the American people through the Commission on Presidential Debates and the Presidential debates that are scheduled every 4 years and this debate.  This amendment would prohibit the pay of any Federal employee who refuses to join an effort to keep secret the difference in funding between the two parties on the question of increasing the minimum wage. Now some may say what is the big deal in the rule because all this issue is not a matter of putting on a suit in

The Obama administration on Wednesday said Secretary Sebelius's remarks were misleading and that, according to the administration, the department's policy is ``still unaltered.''

Mr. Speaker, in just this past year approximately 79,000 pages of regulations were printed in the Federal Register. In just this year almost 3 million pages of regulations were published in the Federal Register. The total amount of regulations for this year is 9.7 million pages and will total over 6 million pages in the Federal Register this year. These agencies have published more than half a million more pages of Federal regulations than were issued in the entire 10-year period between the agency first issuing regulations and last issuing regulations in 1994 and 1995 and the beginning of this decade.  Many of the new and more complex regulations are issued without an agency public comment period and many are of significant and protracted nature without even the opportunity for review or comment before they are promulgated. It is time for the Department of the Interior to do some good and make some adjustment

So this is not the time to do that and to have Members of the other side sitting here and in this gallery as if we are the only ones in the world who actually know the rules in this House and can come to the conclusion about what those rules are. That is not the case. If they think that it is important that we get into all the details and all of the details that we did not know before the election about the rules of the House, I do not see what is going on here today to support the bill, and I do not see how we are going to have the American people believe

Senators from both parties will be in the Senate building discussing the state of the economy. Their bill will be unveiled later this week. As a result of this legislation, if you are a manufacturer or an entrepreneur in this country, you will have incentives to not put out product that has been under development for some time or requires extended support from the government.

This is an especially dangerous type of drug because of the speed with which it is mixed with other narcotics and is being offered in the last 12 to 18 months in some cases to police officers on the beat. It is also being offered now in some of our churches across America to children at home in some cases.

There are other weather-related provisions, things that the House just discussed and the Senate is considering. But we are not concerned with the weather because the American people care about weather, we should work with them to be able to weather the storms, and we will.

Like any other industry in the United States, arms sales are currently under tremendous pressure from three separate and competing threats--Iran, the current regime in Libya, and the people of Venezuela. Venezuela is experiencing unprecedented economic difficulties, government corruption and civil war that has claimed over 80,000 lives since late February. The military backing of our President threatens the lives of both the military and the opposition. If these threats are not addressed within the next month, the United States will have had its hands full for many months.  Furthermore, it is imperative that we bring to a close one of the most intensive and expensive foreign policy debates in recent years--this year's review, the Arms Export Control Act of

The reason I am so much in favor of it is because the problem we have is when we look at the overall American economy, it is not getting better. I think we have to begin to recognize that the problem we have with our tax

Mr. Chairman, first, I will start by complimenting my Republican colleagues for what I think is a very important action we took last night to delay the implementation of the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1990. This time we are doing it by not moving forward with the rule as originally put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency. The objection was from the other side of the aisle, and I think it is appropriate that we stick to the original rule so that we have a chance to set this right in the final vote.  First of all, I would like to point out that I represent such a part of the Nation as the inner part of the city of Washington, and we are always one step behind the leadership of this Congress in terms of getting legislation to the President. Not only that, but the issue of large stream projects is one that we

I don't plan on offering that amendment at this time because I am not optimistic about the work that will be required in order to complete this bill as soon as possible. But when the Senator from Illinois brings up the basic question he raises, it is one that the administration and the Nation have been working on for several years. It has not been concluded, but they are moving as quickly as they can. We have a process that should be established. We need to keep an open mind on this issue and set a timetable for completing the legislation.  Madam President, I will ask the Senator from Illinois a question on this issue which has to do with

More to the point, even if we were obligated--which we're not, we maintain export controls--this would be a significant increase. It would be a tremendous increase that would only take us by $1 billion off of the cost to the United States Government and to a very small number of the entities. So it's also not a very important economic issue for the United States of America. It would increase the value of the dollar and its value in international markets substantially for both private and public sectors at the same time.  The other point that I wanted to make to the Senator from Massachusetts is that we have a disaster in our country right now that we have to deal with. We are doing the responsible thing here by saying we have to do some things that the American people are not going to be able to do for the next 7 days.

In fact, I believe as many as 40 or 50 Democrats will be joining us this Thursday in calling for the budget resolution to include veterans health care as a part of the budget resolution, and to allow for debate on that part of the budget that will be brought to the floor in the very near future. So veterans health care as part of the budget that we are talking about should be a priority of the Democratic majority in the Senate in the near future as we vote on the budget resolution,

And it is cosponsored by Senators Domenici, Stevens, Lott, and Collins, and it would provide for debate and a vote on the amendment in the Senate on April 11 and the amendment in the House on April 15.

What we have is the administration is reneging on the contract that was entered into after the Office of Personnel Management received notice from the Pentagon of the Corps of Engineers that the Corps wanted to construct a new building for the Coast Guard.  I offered an amendment, originally offered in the defense authorization bill last year, that would have provided the Coast Guard with $2.8 billion, in taxpayer funds, for the construction of a new Corps headquarters building. The Coast Guard had requested and the Navy had requested $2.

I think that a number of my colleagues will come to the floor of the Senate and tell the people that they do not want any changes in the Social Security system and what we are doing here is not important enough for them to be concerned about. I think they have a fundamental problem with the Social Security system and are going to have to do something if they hope to get the attention and the support that they need to try to change it. But the reason I say this is because the way it works is that for a number of years in this Congress it would seem that we could not get any change on this matter and all we could do is take our time and create a great deal of trouble for people trying to help their families through difficult times like we find ourselves today in this

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, whatever amendments Democrats offer to try to balance the budget should not be in the debate on this appropriations bill because they are not getting a vote on it in this House. We Republicans want to take care of the needs of the American people. That is why we offer every amendment that is needed to balance the budget. I think we have done that in the committee. Democrats want to vote on the line-item veto and on bringing out the spending that we agree is so essential to the way we do business in this House, yet we are not allowed to do it on this bill because the Democrats are not allowed to vote on that here in the House of Representatives, they are not allowed to offer amendments to balance the budget on this bill or that bill here in the House of Representatives.

I want to announce that at the close of business on Thursday the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill and the House is likely to complete action on that measure on Monday. The Senate will complete action on the highway bill on Monday, with the possibility of further consideration on Tuesday of that bill or possibly Wednesday of that bill. I believe the House will consider the continuing resolution on Tuesday and consideration of the issue of the budget, the most important issue of the week.

While the legislation that is before us today preserves the low-cost technology that enables the distribution of oil from oil shale to refineries in Alaska, the legislation before us today seeks to increase consumption of oil from American refineries while maintaining some sense of stability at the gasoline pump for consumers throughout the country. The Energy bill before us today is a tragic overreach of executive authority that sends the wrong signal to the industry that can only lower the prices of gasoline.  Americans don't have oil in their tanks.

I think everyone here on this floor knows that by supporting this resolution and as the sponsor of the bill and as someone who has been here in Washington for a long time, I come here to support this resolution to call on the United Nations to consider or delay the resolution of war and to invite the President of the United States to the United Nations Security Council for his views on that issue so we can amend the Constitution so we can have a debate and have a vote. I want the President to be able to stand up and present his case as to whether or not he should bring this up or not.  I will speak about that in just a moment, but there are important issues as we consider this resolution that I would like to touch on this afternoon, and that is the urgent

Mr. Speaker, to most Americans coffee is nothing more than a morning pick-me-up, a drink to make you feel better after you wake up in the morning. What this bill does is it takes a hard look at that morning coffee. If we take a look at the impact of some of the jobs that we're trying to put in this House, it is not going to be something that we would take that back from us because it is not going to be something that is not going to be paid for with the revenue that we have already spent over the last 4 years. In fact, we have increased it by an average of 1.5 percent in 4 years from the budget resolution we put in place in 1995. And the results have not been encouraging.

Mr. President, the African nation of Sudan is a cradle and safe haven for the terrorist group known as the Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb [AQIM]. The terrorist group is active in southern and central Africa and would like to impose terror on a large number of people in the world today. As an independent nation on its own, the Government of the Republic of Sudan [Sudan] has limited effective military capability and is unable to effectively confront this growing threat. The attack this month on a military base in the capital of Juba that killed more than 50 United States soldiers and wounded hundreds more and which resulted in the evacuation of the American diplomatic mission there is a clear and present danger to the national security of this country and the United States that cannot be contained or addressed without a renewed commitment of the United States Government

We have also passed unemployment insurance for the disabled so that they can get their job and pay their bills and move forward with their lives. This is the right thing to do and it is not fair for those who have served our country to not have the same opportunities to pay for these benefits. And that is what this bill is all about.

But I want to be clear about what this legislation does not do. As a result of the crisis in our legal system, millions of Americans are currently going without legal representation in our system of Government. That is not fair.

This bill would allow the Government to borrow money from the Social Security trust fund without providing any revenues to the Treasury, undermining our faith in the integrity of the first five words of the Pledge of Allegiance. This is a clear attempt to limit the options of free people to be able to participate in the public policy process. It also, unfortunately, is a clear reflection of the extreme deep pockets being pushed into the political process by special interests and big corporations to bring attention to issues that really do not need to be talked about in terms of the budget priorities of the Federal Government.

Earlier this year, we saw a market freeze in this country because Government systems were able to be self-service as well as be automatically self-executing. It is the only way this government can be self-governing and at the same time be responsible to the people of this country.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Mollohan-Shays amendment. I rise to give voice to those who care about this issue and to rise to support the Chairman's proposal that will ensure the protection of our national forests and our water supply for the future.  This is a critical issue for the preservation of the American people and for the preservation of the American forests. Today we have been told by all sides of this issue that the issue has nothing to do with public lands, it has to do with the fact that we have not been able to focus on the forest health problem of the last decade in this country. We have failed to have the forest health problems of the last 10 years addressed. The rate of decline that the Forest Service has reported on this has been about 5 percent annually for the last 10 years.  Mr. Chairman

Mr. President, in 1918, the Spanish flu pandemic swept the world for a number of months with an outbreak in California that eventually took the lives of 30,000 of our fellow citizens. The flu spread so rapidly in the United States that public health officials said ``the days of scare mongering for the flu were over'' with outbreaks becoming more and more severe and contagious within the year. The strain in which it was found was one of the world's deadliest, with 2 million people dying in 1918 alone.  Fortunately for Americans, the pandemic began in Canada, where in December 1918, the Flu Pandemic Month, Canada hosted a smallpox vaccination for public health workers and their children. Over 100,000 people signed up to volunteer and 34,000 children were vaccinated. After inoculation, flu cases dropped dramatically and overall hospital

The  SSM Group supports the Kennedy Space Center and I think it is absolutely right to support the space station as a cooperative effort to bring America forward

I rise in support of this commonsense legislation to restore the Department of the Interior to fiscal year 2007 funding levels and to make some real and significant cuts in the so-called Alternative Fuel Program and in the Foreign Investment Program that is the reason I come to the floor this evening. Let me tell you why I have done this and what it means to my constituents. First of all, after months of me speaking on the floor on this floor on the issue of alternative fuels and funding for alternative fuel, I did not hear one speaker say that alternative fuels was a bad thing and that we needed to just go in another direction in terms of cutting spending in this

I thank my colleague from Alaska for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule for two very important reasons. One is that for the first time in almost a decade, a Republican majority has arrived in the House of Representatives and yet the House has not even debated this rule yet. When it did that this year for the first time in 7 years, they voted down the Dole rule on ethics reform which passed the House last November 3. So as a matter of fact that is not a Democrat or Republican amendment to that House rule that the House will debate for the first time in 7 years before it considers this bill. It is actually the Dole rule that the House will vote on to amend the House rule for the first time in 7 years before it even considers this bill because that House rule did not even come

As members of the Armed Services Committee, we have held multiple hearings and provided oversight of the National Commission on Uniformed Services and the National Defense Act.

We have not debated on the House floor proposals proposed by the administration that would repeal health care reform legislation and would roll back important Federal regulations on businesses and innovation.

Mr. President, due to the death of a close family member, I am regrettably unable to support the Treasury bill of rights for our first responders and their families of this great Nation that has been so important to us as Members of Congress for years now. The time has come to honor the President's Executive order in the Trade Act of 2002.  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Hutchison, in the consideration of the resolution. I have always believed that President Bush's first Executive order was a strong statement of the Administration's commitment to national security by reaffirming its policy toward China. This bold, decisive response to China's recent military expansion has now given us a chance to bring our understanding of China to a whole new level. We may need to wait until China answers congressional questions about its trade practices,

For the past year alone, more than 1 million veterans have come through the doors of the Office of House of Heroes in and around Rockland, which is part of the Veterans Affairs and Community Services building on the National Mall in Washington, DC. These veterans have served our country on countless fronts and were just as important and selfless in their service to their country as their colleagues in the armed services.

I say out of touch because it guts the Social Security trust fund, it weakens the program that so many Americans depend on to get the night light on at night, and it makes deep cuts in nutrition and other safety net programs for low- and moderate-income Americans, and it is so out of touch that the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means in this House did not even ask for a straight up or down vote on it before the first vote was taken. It is so out of touch because it includes no cuts for the Medicare program in the Republican budget.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. First of all, Madam Speaker, this language, which was put in as part of the crime bill last year to deal with the REAL ID Act, is a good idea in a law enforcement sense because it would make it easier for us to go in our backyards and look for a safe house and for those who might be hiding in those backyards. We need more background checks that actually allow that to happen. And it is even better than that because those who are smuggling in human beings, when you see them down there and you know they are there, they will tell you that they are there for their own good and not just to take someone's job. We need to keep that from happening because that is why we do it in law enforcement sense. That is why we have law enforcement here in

Lincoln was the first city in America established under the franchise for a single city which was established by the Federal Government. By 1831 Lincoln was the fifth largest city in the country. In that same year Lincoln passed a constitutional amendment that established a public school system for the District of Columbia and Washington. Since its establishment Lincoln has also been a strong supporter of free speech and has fought for the right of free association and free government by all people to demonstrate against all government authority in its various forms and throughout the world. This position has been very important to me as I continue to fight for civil rights throughout the country.

Over 15,000 children have served in the Active Duty military and over 15,000 children have served in the National Guard or Reserve.

I thank the Senator for his question. I suggest that the 1998 definition is a more accurate one for the determination of number of employees or numbers of contract employees than the proposed 2003 definition that is going to be released in April in the next act on the GAO request because the 1999 companies may have 7 or 8 employees and not 11 or 12, and the 2002 companies may have about 20 or 25 employees but have 7 or 8 employees because of the higher number of contract employees that they had in 1998 than the 2001 companies did in 1999. So the 1998 definition in the report will reflect the actual 2002 companies, not the 1999 companies, which will be 21 months later than the 2005 companies in March of 2003 because the number of the contract employees has not changed at that time as much as the number of employees in 1998 did in 1999.

However, this is an unjustified judgment that should not be made today or any time soon. The overwhelming majority of the people of the United States believe that the fight against terrorism is America's top priority and that it should not be handled by the Federal Government because it is of such vital importance to the national security of our country.

These are the purposes for which Mr. Hunter and I believe that this legislation is misguided. It would extend the word ``Deforestation'' to any mark which has been used by a registered proprietor or holder of a valid trademark for the performance of the act of removal of a prime requirement of the Natural Environment, and it would extend this word even to ``destroy,'' which means that the name has the same meaning in many other uses besides by

They are right to be concerned because the way we have done it for the last 50 years has been very onerous. You had to go through the hand-typed forms and you had to make your taxes appear in some way to this organization that a tax check would come back to you. We have got a system now where if you have your taxes in for the same month that you make your other taxes, and they do not get there the next month and you have to get them the next month and all of that will be for the

Mr. Speaker, why is the Ethics Committee making the special exception in the case of the special committee on ethics that the Republicans have put up on the House floor? Why are Republicans not standing up for the rule that prohibits lobbyists from accepting gifts from Members or anyone else with power of subpoena?  Mr. Speaker, I wonder why all the Republicans are really not talking about ethics reform. Congress should not be out here criticizing Republicans for not making the same ethical rules that apply to all Members of Congress and lobbyists.  Congress should be standing for ethics reform, and this Republican Ethics Committee should at least ask the Ethics Committee for what they think it is that we should be doing as a House.  It is obvious that there are some abuses in this House that Congress should be demanding be corrected, and that is why it is unfortunate that Republican

With respect to section 407, I have a unanimous-consent agreement with Senator Bond that he would be our Special Envoy for Small Business Administration. He is already working with the Small Business Administration at a level that will not impair any of our ability to make these permanent new regulations as the House did as it is very difficult to make any permanent decisions and what I believe is more important in America today to retain a dynamic small business system is a vibrant small business

That is the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran if we do not act in a way that would not allow them to get a nuclear weapon and use it against us. This bill makes that clear. It is much more reasonable. It is a compromise.  We will vote for this bill.

That is the purpose of this bill as we consider this legislation and will have to make that determination in the context of what is in the overall legislation that we consider on the floor this week and how that will affect people and the quality of their life as they get out of the program that they may have in their insurance plan.

But not as I have worked so closely with judges over the last 7 years in the other body in which I have had the privilege of serving that the American people have been far more concerned about whether judges are being properly given a fair shake by the majority than whether their rulings are being done in accordance with the law and the best interests of the people in the States and in the Congress.

That is not really an emergency in the circumstances. The provisions in the bill allow the Federal Government to deal with these kinds of crises by letting the Presidential first responder decide when he wants to use the assistance of the Federal Government to deal with a public health emergency or a natural disaster.

I would be interested to hear what he has to say.  He stated, ``I have come to the conclusion that what is at issue is not just a technical change but a policy issue.'' So this bill has a rather technical and ideological basis but a policy basis as well. That is what I want to hear from the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez). I would be interested in a quote or

It has been a great honor to work with the minority in the Congress to help make these clinics a reality.  In fact, in March 2002 the District of Columbia enacted a law to grant a 5-year extension to the funding level. This legislation would have raised the existing $250 million annual grant to $350 million with the expectation of the $350 million increase would come through the same legislation that Congress passed to grant legislation

The new Administration to Invest in America [AIIA] is proposing to exempt $1 billion from the total amount of the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request for the Energy and Water Development Agency [E&WDA]. As the most important domestic environmental program the American people depend on for their well-being, this fund must make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.  This amendment simply clarifies that the E&WDA would receive only $1 billion from the new administration's budget request.

Mr. President, last November, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent. This bill would limit price increases in prescription drugs to 3 percent or less each year for 5 years and increase the marketing of generic drugs to the pharmaceutical industry by $1 billion a year for 5 years, whichever is greater.  Drug company profits rose significantly during the first 4 years of the Drug Competition Act as drug manufacturers reported higher sales, higher profits, and added significantly to the compensation of their top executives.  The bill also increased the size of the publicly traded drug companies, requiring them to offer four plans to the insurance companies at a 10-percent premium over the current level. The intent was to discourage insurers from covering the higher-cost drugs as well. A recent analysis showed that the sales of generic drugs increased significantly between 1996 and 1999, even though

It also would make a penalty against the Secretary if the agency finds that a project has been procured using a bribe or coercion.

Mr. Speaker, the only thing shocking about these recent scientific discoveries is they seem to reflect exactly what the people of this country said they wanted in health care reform in the first place. They say we should be getting better health care health care for all Americans, not treating those who need help the most. We should encourage individuals to seek health care services that will help them live healthier and longer lives.  The Republican leadership in Washington and here in Congress is determined to accomplish all of that. Today we are taking another step to do just that with the passage of the Healthy People and Healthy Planet Act. This bill does many things to stimulate growth in health care spending. It reauthorizes the Healthy People Health Program, which means it will cost less to provide health care to millions of Americans today than it did in 2004 when the legislation was

As a matter of fact, if we take into consideration that the private sector is smaller now than it was in the previous 80 years and, for most businesses, fewer customers are served, there are more businesses that could qualify under this program to offer credit and expansion of the credit.

This amendment would make a mockery of this Congress that the nuclear waste from commercial activities will be subject to the same requirements and protections that we impose on nuclear waste from Department of Energy activities.

But that is not the whole story, because many people are not living that up-to-date life as we would like them to live it.

In fact, this is the most important issue of the day in the lives of working families in America today because what this has said is it is possible to put an end to the $2.5 trillion in tax cuts and the $245 billion in spending cut in this contract. What it has meant is a $350 billion deficit in 2 years. It is a $1.7 trillion increase in Federal taxes in 2 years, and it is a $1.

Let's find out what the facts are that are there in order to help all Americans reduce the deficit, including the people that are being so attacked on this side of the aisle today and I have a number of things to say about them if we get to the actual implementation of this plan, but before I get to those important things to keep those cuts to the deficit that we can protect and help people save, let me say that, with this amendment, Mr. Chairman, the Members of Congress should make their own decisions about how to reduce the deficit.

It is for the benefit of all Americans that we try to follow these rules and rules for our staff and we will do that at this point in time. But let me share with the Senate today a discussion of why we have this issue in the Tax Code because the question I have asked people in our offices is what is in this bill? And the very first answer is: What is the bill going to do for my family and how are they going to pay for it? Why is it in the Tax Code in the first place? What is it going to do for my children and grandchildren and how are they going to pay for it?  One of the most successful programs of the Federal Government

Mr. President, at the risk of asking someone on the Republican side, isn't there such a common sense approach here with so many different measures that might be coming up in the weeks ahead that this Senator is not going to be able to take part in that process which has been moving ahead with so many bills and that we can't allow that to go forward without getting a vote on the amendment which would increase the current levels of child support enforcement but would also provide some relief to the families that are the working poor that would have less financial support if they were able to get more help from the Federal Government. That might seem extreme because it would be out of step with the majority of the American people who are so frustrated with not having enough help from their families that they have to turn to the Federal Government and do it because of that government problem

It does absolutely nothing to lower the price of gasoline and absolutely nothing to help middle class families purchase their first home or pay for their mortgage. There is not money in this bill, either.  This legislation increases the minimum wage by approximately $1 per hour, a rate we haven't seen in 25 years, and it would be a direct tax increase to middle class families. While I applaud the Ways and Means Committee for tackling issues such as flood insurance, I fear that we are wasting valuable tax dollars on a flawed stimulus bill that will have a dramatic effect on consumers across this Nation. It is my hope that those who voted to not support this legislation will work with us to improve it in the future, and I am hopeful that the next time this process moves forward it will be less

Today in the United States there are nine billion pounds of pesticides in use. In fact today we have used more pesticides than all of the world's counties have in all of the years of the last century combined. The best known and the most widely used of these pesticides in the United States are known as the fungicides. The other four are the thienosin.

It is not about any proposal that would have made Federal regulations even more difficult to carry out by stripping those agencies of their ability to even manage the rules they create and the procedures they use to bring them to Congress. The House Republicans plan to take that power away from the Federal agencies and give it to Congress in a day of legislation that is never going to pass Congress. The House Republicans will even eliminate important rules that have been championed and supported by President Bush for years.

Madam Speaker, for the third time this Congress, the House of Representatives is again addressing the health care crisis in our country, this time in a piece of legislation which just passed the House last year. Last year's health care bill was the most irresponsible and unworkable bill ever to pass Congress because it lacked the President's signature, and it has never been debated in any substantive or public forum, much less seriously considered by Congress. And, unfortunately, it is still here on the floor today.  Since the beginning of the health care crisis we have faced with the way the Congress has been spending and spending money as the health care crisis and as the health care state has progressed continues to worsen. We are making the problem worse, and we should not ignore it or respond to it by imposing another fiscal and economic stimulus bill with an

Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Tennessee for speaking so eloquently and so clearly about this bill because I believe the Senator is right on target with the Congress having no control over the allocation of Federal funding for the Medicare plan. We have no control over the budget, we have no control over the spending. When the President says no tax increases on the American people, then that means that if in fact he does put tax increases on the American people, we are in danger. So I rise to support the underlying legislation before us today because I believe that it will save the American people much of their Government funding and not cut Medicare benefits for seniors because of how we spend it as a government. I also think it is a bill that will increase the potential for many Medicare beneficiaries to get to the point in time where they are

This legislation is critically important because I believe our common security interests are at risk. Even a partial prohibition on sales to countries that are known to have been involved in human rights violations is important if we are to protect our vital interests in addressing both our security and economic interests

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 176th anniversary of Greek Independence Day and to pay tribute to the 30 years of Greek civil service who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and in Greece under a wide variety of patriotic and religious differences. To say that the United States has been and always will be a strong and independent nation with a strong and independent Greek-American community would be an understatement. It is true that the United States has been a development Nation for the past 30 years, which has been a result of policies that allowed a family to leave the farm and travel to a foreign land and become an American citizen. I know that the history that we create as Americans is one of individual freedoms and individual initiative. America is a nation built by immigrants who have fought and fought and fought for freedom in what

Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, as a long-time advocate for the sovereign rights of Native Americans, it is my honor to be here today to recognize the Montana River Indian Community Court.  The Montana River Indian Community Court has consistently advocated and made invaluable contributions to Montana. After many years of hard work by the court and its members and supporters, the Montana Valley Tribal Court was established by the Montana Legislature in 1995 as a recognition of the Sioux Nation of Montana as a sovereign nation and a sovereign community, thus opening the door for Native American recognition in Indian Country and across the country.  I would like to commend the Iowa and Minnesota Tribal Courts for increasing our understanding of Native Americans as a sovereign nation.  I am pleased to also honor the court in West Michigan for setting a trail for a sovereign Native community to protect and preserve their unique culture

The minimum wage issue should be about wages and work conditions for all people in this country and not something that is handled under the control of a few or a handful of interests that care more about making it easier to make the world safe for them than doing their job and getting jobs done for our fellow Americans. But that is what we have gotten here in this issue because it is not going to work. The majority in this House and the liberal leadership here in this Congress need to

It is to invest in people so they can stay in their homes and with their children and their families.  One of the important parts of this bill is the alternative minimum tax that we did not have, and I have gone over in some detail on that. It has been a real problem to many of our members of this House, the thought of people being subject to this kind of a tax.

Mr. President, it says: Just a few years ago, before Democrats took control of Congress, Americans were worried that their health insurance was too expensive and that they had too much to lose if they needed the care they needed. We all knew that the Democrats' health care bill would be the first comprehensive overhaul of the health care system in at least a quarter of a century and would result in more than a quarter of a million Americans losing their health insurance altogether. Millions of Americans would lose the ability to keep their doctors and plans they liked and would lose the government-run insurance that so many in Congress actually voted for and were forced to sign up for under this bill. Millions of Americans would see their health care coverage taken away from them for no other reason than their age or a medical condition that they or their employer didn't like and which was

Madam Chairwoman, there is no question that the rural areas in this country frequently get shortchanged in the implementation of nutrition programs and the availability of rural health care services that are provided by the VA and the Department of Health and Human Services. One area where the government should make clear that certain programs such as Section 8 and Section 202 are available to all Americans is in the areas that have been identified as high cost areas that have been particularly hard hit by the recent economic downturn and lack of private sector investment in agriculture and rural infrastructure. The fact is that when the Federal Government has the ability to set out a national investment strategy that puts at risk the very means of providing those services and the ability to increase the private sector's investment in those same areas, it should do so in a way that is not only consistent with and consistent with its

Mr. Speaker, in 2018, more than 2 million Americans will suffer from addiction to prescription drugs. According to the National Alliance to End Drug Abuse, this year alone almost one out of five adults will seek treatment for substance use disorders and addiction, with more than one in four individuals also in a relationship with a substance abuser. These statistics are very disturbing and hard to believe, but it is time that we do something about it.  President Obama announced the first national substance use disorder strategy in 2001, and it is important to note that there has been much improvement since that time. More than 2 years later, we still do not have a comprehensive national strategy that can provide all of the information and support we need for treatment of the public health issues that we face and the public health challenges that we face.  I am very pleased that this

Mr. Chairman, today I'm offering an amendment that will preserve the critical air pollution protections in the bill in the context of a clean continuing resolution. The climate crisis and the economic downturn are forcing communities across the country and around the world to increasingly turn to clean, safe sources of energy like wind, geothermal and biomass. Unfortunately, this may not be the worst-case scenario for our Nation. Studies have shown that wind and solar power can lead to a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that can have a significant impact on the environment.  These new technologies are also perfectly suited for towns and cities looking to develop more efficient or better-equipped sewer systems. For example, the Lungren Zones project in Michigan recently initiated a pilot program that I helped to design to address the growing problem of forest decay in schools. The pilot project utilized

It is clear that the economy is in recession and that this recession will have far-reaching effects on people and their families. This recession can be compared to the recent economic crisis in which we all have to deal with. When the recession began in the first quarter of this year, the Dow Jones had more than doubled from an estimated 10 to 21 million. Since then, the Dow Jones is down close to 2 percent. In my congressional district, we have seen the impact this recession has had on our economy. I am pleased that this economic bill contains language to provide 1.

This bill, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania has so aptly pointed out, addresses one area of the food problem by mandating the Department of Agriculture to consult with State and local communities to ensure that food stamp participants' access to the food stamp system is not adversely affected by food production safety inspections, high security food inspection or explosives testing requirements, or any other unknown or unsanitary condition. It also allows USDA to look at quality, safety, and other Federal regulations regarding food stamp program participation before implementing them.  I

Mr. Chief Justice, I have reached an agreement with the Democratic leader on how to proceed through the night in order to reach a conclusion of the hour. As of now, I will not go into any of the morning business time that we have scheduled, but we can discuss that as I meet with the leader today and see how we go tomorrow morning. We have three judges on the way to the floor as well as the Senate's request for the second session of the 113th Congress, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and a supplemental. So that will be the way we go.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Stenholm).  The amendment was agreed to. The CHIEF JUSTICE. It is now in order to consider amendment No

order speaker bill

Mr. Speaker, when the Committee on Rules met to consider the rule on this bill, they indicated that they would only consider amendments related to budget authority or emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 1995 which are offered to the House bill under the order submitted by the Committee on Rules. At the same time, the Speaker's Web site indicated that under the authorization included in H.R. 1073 the Committee would have a traditional open rule.  I ask the Speaker, am I correct in this interpretation?  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are advised that under rule XXII of the House rules manual an amendment may only be offered by a Member or his designee to a portion of the bill, offered by the chairman or ranking member, or jointly with the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Appropriations, or to a

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor all of the hard work of civil servants and the hard work of our military men and women in uniform. In particular, I rise today to honor the distinguished service of Colonel Carlos Sanchez, Air Force SPC Xena Lopez, Army Field Special Forces SFC Christopher Norwood, and Army Special Operations SPC Reza Azam, who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This is a small but very important achievement in the greater defense of our Nation and in the annals of our nation's history, and I wish to recognize them and my colleagues in the House of Representatives for their selfless service to our Nation and in support of our national security.

Mr. Speaker, today I am going to be introducing legislation to stop children from buying tobacco products from other countries that come out of China and Vietnam. I want to thank my good friends on the other side of the aisle for bringing it to the floor today, because it is something that needs to be taken seriously.  The tobacco industry has done a great deal for over 100 years to spread the disease of tobacco use in the United States and in the world. I think the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Portman] and I have found through our correspondence with the Secretary of Health and Human Services that they are doing all they can to enforce anti-tobacco laws in China and Vietnam. But there is a great many kids today that are not as protected and will be asked to pay the price because of that.  There has

Mr. Chairman, the word ``responsibility'' has been raised several times in this debate. I believe the Responsibility In Education Act that we are considering today has the ability to change the way education is funded in America. Our children deserve the best education possible, and when our education system fails to provide this due education that is needed for our young people to succeed in the 21st century economy and also to continue the mobility of this Nation and put children first so we have the most qualified workforce that we have in the history of our Nation, then we are not only shortchanging them in education, but we are not giving them the skills to be in the work force for the next 100 years. Our economic well-being as a Nation should be measured by how we provide the most educational resources to our people and to our future leaders so that they may have

With that, I yield to my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).  Mr. FITZPATRICK. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his very generous amendment and for his leadership in looking after our homeland security needs and not only in the context of the amendment that is on the floor today but also in looking after the intelligence needs of our Nation.  And let me say very quickly that if we don't act now, as I think we have a responsibility as a nation to act before the next attack takes place, we face an uncertain future and a nonstarter.

Another matter that concerns me is the recent audit that was performed on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in the State of Alaska. That could not be done because of the massive amount of energy that it contains. We all remember that thing that they did when they put that pipeline there and they cannot get it to move that much of the oil because it has this huge amount of that kind of energy that they have not moved because the cost is so much that it is impossible for the people of that State to do that. So it is very hard to have the State of Alaska be able to do the things that they are trying to do as they are trying to meet these challenges and these bills. So we have that problem we have that they are not able to be able to meet those challenges on the pipeline that is now being constructed. I do

I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from South Carolina to spread the word on this issue in the State of South Carolina to encourage the prevention of abortions and to help encourage our many young women who are beginning to try to decide to become pregnant to have information about the various options available to them. I think there is a growing need for information that goes well beyond the main question of where does one come in to do an abortion and what is best for that person to do. I have certainly been in support of helping young people who have come to our own State and are interested in that process to make sure that they are provided with information and to be at least part of the reproductive health community and to have people who are interested in what is best for them. That information is being spread in a way to try to make some of

This bill is the work of the new chair of the New York State Public Law and Policy Committee, the gentlewoman from New York State (Ms. Slaughter). We worked closely on this legislation to address concerns that were not really addressed but that the administration at the time included in the Financial Services bill.  This bill ensures that law enforcement officials, first responders, and prosecutors all have the training they need to have in order to effectively take on the next terrorist attack.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to explain the content and purpose of this amendment, which would provide the funds needed to support a recently established program within the Department of Energy for the purpose of assisting private entities in developing alternative fuels for electric vehicles. This program is called the Projects for Competitive Alternatives for Electric Vehicles program. It would allow private companies such as GM and Chrysler to have access to a competitive and limited private sector funding stream for investing in research and development of new electric vehicle technologies. This grant would encourage more than 35 companies to develop these innovative programs within the next year to generate billions of dollars in private sector investments and jobs.  The funding levels proposed for this program would be offset by cuts to other accounts within the Department of Energy that would result in losses to the Department, including various government accounts and investments within the Department of Defense

Let me just give a little example from a record company in my district that could be going back to Canada because the provisions in this bill that the CAFTA wants to impose upon our country would prevent it from doing so.  It would prevent it from doing so because it would make it impossible to buy the green equipment that we need to produce more jobs in this country by adding tariffs that it would have to pay to companies that are already doing that with
