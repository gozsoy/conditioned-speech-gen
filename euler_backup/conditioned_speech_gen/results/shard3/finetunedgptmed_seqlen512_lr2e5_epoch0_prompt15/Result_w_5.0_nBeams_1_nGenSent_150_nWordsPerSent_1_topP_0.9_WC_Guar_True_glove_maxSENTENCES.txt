Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was not a politician who only was for the rich and powerful but was also for the candidate's issues and also for his causes and for his position on welfare reform bill. In that way, he displayed respect for people from all walks of life, the poor and the rich.  In 1993, I had the privilege of serving as the chairman of the Independent Women's Forum, a group of women in various fields that began to tell our story. A group of us visited all the major media outlets and tried to educate all of our families about the benefits of a paid family and tax relief that the Democratic Party had. We did that through the Heritage Foundation, which has participated in working-class policy and development, and we succeeded in having this amazing demonstration and

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing to repeal the health insurance company mandate that is currently in effect in the Affordable Care Act. We must repeal this terrible law which will ultimately cost taxpayers more than $800 billion a year in unnecessary taxes and eliminate the health insurance companies which make America's health care system work for the American people.  The health care law will drive up drug prices and drive up premiums for America's families. It will cripple individual freedom in America, and create new regulations and mandates that will stifle innovation and prevent real competition for Americans.  The health insurance companies, who are responsible for filling the billions of claims annually, are simply not allowed to charge Americans, other Americans, or even other Americans for covering their medical expenses. This is a terrible mistake.  Americans

It is a great day for America.  One of the things that has become obvious in the last 5 years, as Members of this body have marched out into the hallowed halls of Congress, is that what we are doing is the hard work of the American people, the American people want us to do a responsible, balanced, bipartisan bill to combat some of the problems in our country.  We have heard all the talk of trying to repeal ObamaCare, like this week, I heard some of that. I am all for repealing ObamaCare. But I do not think that a replacement that basically does the same thing as ObamaCare is any better.

Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues and so many others around the country in making a historic and historic statement in support of the troops in the United States military in Bosnia and in making a profound and profound difference in the world.  That is the task that the Congress must undertake in this very, very difficult time. It cannot fail to recognize the need to change this policy and ensure that accountability is maintained.  To address that challenge, we have offered this resolution and our Republicans have supported it. There are several proposals. Senator Durbin, myself and others have been at great lengths to find a path forward that recognizes the full force of U.S. military and diplomatic action and accountability.  The one thing that we have found in the Senate that has been most attractive to both of us is that the American people

That vote was an historic and historic first step in the process to take citizenship away from people in this country who have been here since their country was created in 1776, the first American document that held that nation together.  This is a conference that is going to open up this Congress to discussion and debate on several of the issues that are under discussion by this Congress, not only on issues of immigration but also on matters of the environment and the environment policy of this country.

Mr. President, finally, as each session of Congress comes to a close, both leaders traditionally look back and say when they are last in Congress they had some things in the past that the Members had not thought about when they came in as the Democratic leadership just a couple of years ago.  There was one issue, at least the issue of the budget deficit, where we did not take much interest in and were not able to go into detail about until we reached the new year. And that was the so-called Government shutdown. That issue lasted throughout our time in Congress. We took about two months for the shutdown. It was not that long. We know what it means to be in a shutdown, and that is the result of the fact that we have had our spending, the government's spending that goes on, delayed as a result

The chairman of the committee also has testified in favor of the amendment.  What the amendment does, by increasing the total appropriated under the amendment from $500 million to $1.2 billion, it will require State and local governments to continue their already extraordinary disaster relief efforts, the extraordinary work that is going on in Minnesota.

Because the law has caused uncertainty for consumers and health care companies all across the country and due to problems with the law's implementation and implementation of the law's protections against discrimination against those who have pre-existing conditions, the law has been called unconstitutional by court sanctions against the Federal Government. That's what is so shocking about this bill. It criminalizes Federal employees who are crimes against individuals with preexisting conditions.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk about the fact that on January 1 of this year we will be in the second week of the Government shutdown that is going on in our country and that the President and the Democrat majority have done everything they can to say that we need to go on and pay for the Government while at the same time state that they will not pay for our needs if we do not pass a continuing resolution in the budget year or the energy tax cut. The only reason that they have a continuing resolution is so they can cut $70 billion for their own consumption and pay for $70 billion price tags on other people's energy bills and pay for it with debt.  While these numbers don't tell the whole story, you can clearly hear the importance of this issue. If the Republican majority and

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, last July when we first established the Infrastructure Investment Fund Act, I made it clear that we could not budget for these costs in this year's conference report. Since the conference report then included $1 billion for flood assistance and $5 billion for the second annual supplemental appropriation for FEMA's disaster relief effort, we have had time to review the consequences of this spending. This cost has long been projected. I am very pleased that the government is no longer relying solely on this program. This year, the Federal Government has made a commitment to making an investment in our Nation's flood control infrastructure, and I want to commend Chairman Obey, Ranking Member Wasserman Schultz and the Majority Leader for their ongoing commitment to flood relief.  Given the impact on this Nation's infrastructure,

Mr. President, in my statement, I referred to the impact of what this amendment would have on the Department of Defense. It is critical that we emphasize the civilian workforce who is impacted by the uncertainty that the amendment will create and that is why I think it is a good bill.  I would like to also be able to say that the President has been very positive about this amendment, as I stated. It has broad bipartisan support, which I am confident will not only ensure that we achieve our goals, but it will also ensure that we can continue to have a strong defense industrial base.  As I pointed out, the DOD workforce is vitally important. This amendment provides us the flexibility to retain some of these workers who are presently in the Federal workforce, but are here in uniform because they provide the capability for this country.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague. Mr. President, let me make a very simple statement and then ask for time to complete the statement I have just made.  The amendment that is before us states that when the Federal Government develops a national land use plan in accordance with the Land and Water Conservation Fund Amendment Act of 1992 and the Constitution of the United States of America that the study and analysis be conducted on the existing country to see if there are any changes that need to be made to the law to facilitate planning. If the plans are not adopted, the existing Federal law governing the use of federally owned lands, the National Wilderness Preservation Act, shall stand the test of time and its exemptions will expire.  This is important to me because I think many of us have concerns about Federal control of federally owned lands.

The Postal Service needs to do a better job of getting to the people it needs to help divert the monies that they have to use for postage costs and supplies.

I would like to recognize the outstanding work of the bill sponsors and the staffers that worked so hard on this legislation to ensure that it would have passed the Senate without such excessive limits on payments to growers. The farmers who receive payments from the Program have agreed to comply with this legislation to pay to farmers their fair market value of those payments and loaned them money that they can no longer pay back.  As we all know, this bill does not eliminate any payments. The assistance is restricted to growers, not all rural and urban Americans, but those whose farming is conducted in areas where payment is available. And, interestingly, many farmers who do receive payments, do so only because they have to because

Yes, the gentleman is correct. School food authorities must have maximum flexibility to plan menus and meet the needs of their schools to protect the health and safety of school children and to correct for health and safety risks in their school cafeterias.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting the Mid-Arkansas River Valley in my home State of Alabama. There I found the mother-in-law of a wonderful young man who was a very good friend of my wife and I and who has been so well taken care of since he has been in my life since he has been here with me years ago here in the Senate and many, many years before that even here in this very Chamber we have felt so deeply about not only our disabilities but our tremendous good fortune in the sense that we have so much life to be able to feel.  That young man--a good friend and a good representative of the South of our State, of his hometown, Madison--and a number of his close friends and family have been going into Alabama's Southeast Region of the country

The idea behind this section is to modernize the structure of the Federal service to help to give employees more control and to allow them to make their own choices about their health care when they return to their civilian customs.  The idea of putting down a goal that they can have a free pass to get health care if they do not choose to participate in a plan that they do not want to participate in when they attempt to retire and try to create a permanent market that is viable and self-supporting is a good idea. Unfortunately, today we are seeing that we are seeing Federal service employees struggling to find a new solution to this problem. Instead of allowing them more

It is a bad bill, and a terrible bill for our country.  And this bill gives families another reason to hate it. This bill keeps the power to rein in the bureaucracy and keep it out of their lives. This bill does nothing to strengthen our country. It lets the Bush administration get away with saying anything they want because this bill keeps the power to keep us from protecting the right to keep and bear arms.

Government should provide the necessary services to ensure that individuals have access to services and resources they need, whether it is medical care, education, job training, housing, nutrition, or health care.

That is an innovative characterization. I think the metaphor it represents is an accurate one. The concept of free enterprise and innovation and competition is something that all of us need to look at. Because when we start down a particular path, there are many mistakes and you have to look at it again and again to keep it going in the right direction. For instance, you cannot completely empty your bank account. You need to keep that account open, that savings, that account balanced.

That was Bush administration policy and Clinton policy is still being followed by this administration with regard to taxes and spending for the next decade and beyond. If we are going to balance the budget in 7 years and continue to increase spending in this economy and in the Federal budget, why are we also trying to make sure that interest payments on the debt are eliminated and raised to $700 billion a year?

We are now one month after the National Day of Prayer and Action by the Congressional Black Caucus and it has grown into a national institution.

Indeed, the percentage of African American children living in poverty in this country has risen each year since 1987.

Mr. Speaker, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the public a draft of the Joint Committee on Taxation report on the amendment offered by the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means on the bill to establish a new mechanism to increase Federal revenues, lower corporate tax rates, and provide incentives for growth.  The Chairman has filed the proposed amendment with the Committee on Ways and Means for adoption by voice vote on February 14, 1996. The Committee on Ways and Means is required to report the report to the Congress within 45 legislative days of its enactment. This proposal addresses some of the concerns raised by the committee and would reduce taxes to promote growth, reduce the cost of Government, and eliminate a measure of administrative complexity.

Mr. President, I am going to propound what I hope will be two unanimous consent requests with regard to the pending consideration of the President's budget request this year, which we are going to ask unanimous consent to proceed with just a short time period.  We had the issue of Medicare just a few minutes ago. Let me just say, in this case I can understand why it is so important. Because we know how very, very badly the economy is doing. So many in this Senate understand that we cannot continue to let the Federal Government continue to take from the elderly to help the wealthy, or to help the senior citizen who is struggling with their health care. We cannot continue to say that somehow we cannot help the individual, the struggling American to make sure he can get the health care that he needs.  The problem is,

Let me just make this a little different than saying that the buses that get back to London and then the airplanes get back to London are actually not supposed to be paying their passengers back in the United States. It is totally patently wrong.

Mr. President, over the weekend the administration announced its decision to impose trade sanctions beginning Monday on 13 Chinese companies whose goods China had sent to the United States without having completed their exports to the United States first. This announcement has the potential to be disastrous for our national security interests in dealing with Chinese intellectual property theft and illicit exports to other nations.  The Chinese Government has agreed to pay $75 million to settle a series of lawsuits relating to software distributed by those companies, which were stolen by another Chinese company, East Asia Software, for its sale in America.  China will not receive any of the Chinese companies' U.S.-made goods until those firms have done business in the United States again. China will not even have been held accountable for the goods seized by East Asia.  In the case of the Chinese companies, the

The veterans who have served are doing an extraordinary job.  As we look around this House, we are starting to think how will we respond to the other thing, whether it's an attack on our homeland or homeland security itself.

Mr. President, I made remarks yesterday on the Senate floor about the nomination of Judge Pryor to be a Federal district court judge for the District of Colorado. As many of us in this Chamber know, Judge Pryor is the only African American judge on the Federal bench who has been confirmed to such a high court within such a short period of time. That has been well documented in cases such as Whitewater, Atkins v. Virginia and the Patricia Tillis nomination and Janet Jackson v. Jim Crow. So Judge Pryor is undoubtedly one of the greatest civil rights and justice- southwick justices in the history of this country. I have said on numerous occasions that Judge Pryor is an outstanding nominee and Leslie Hudgens, a colleague of mine, told me he will be treated with greater respect from fellow Members of the Senate if he were confirmed today.

As the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has stated, the threat to our Government that is motivating our adversaries cannot be ignored by these same adversaries. Therefore, these same threats must be viewed both as preference opportunities for our adversaries and as coercive opportunities for our adversaries.  Many in Congress and the President feel that the executive branch must first undertake this assessment before we begin to develop recommendations for the congressional response. That is not right. We must not stop at this step. We must continue to ensure that this vital intelligence is conducted and interpreted in a timely manner.  A key component to that

Mr. Howard Kriss served honorably as a member of the 65th Engineers during World War II.  After graduating from West Point in 1942, he volunteered for the U.S. Army Reserves and served in several battles along the front lines. After Desert Storm, Desert Sahara and other troop discharges in 1944, he was called back to duty.  In the fall of 1945, the commander of the 85th Army division, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, issued the order to cancel his promotion and remove Mr. Kriss from the front lines in support of Operation Overlord. At that time, Mr. Kriss commanded a brigade that had joined the larger 7th Army Division.

This bill will bring together more than 50 groups committed to improving the Federal Government's contract and other delivery systems in order to reduce the burdens placed upon small businesses, citizens, and taxpayers in procurement decisions.  Those of us who have often fought to reduce Federal regulations are particularly disturbed and disturbed that juveniles, undocumented workers, and current and former military personnel still rely on outdated procurement systems.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill. And let me talk to my colleagues about what it means to me and to the people of Ohio when this is being offered as a tax increase bill to pay for it. My income is actually on the low end in the Nation when it comes to the last 10 years of income tax filing for people with less than $10 million in income in 2000 and 2001 combined with the flawed 2001 tax bill which ultimately cost the average family $1,350 in lost tax revenue which the stock market lost $250 billion.  We need to do this. It is an opportunity to get our economy back on track. As my colleagues know, while the economy is growing, our national debt has increased the size of the Federal Government, creating unprecedented budget deficits. The Bush administration spent billions of dollars to

General Hayden did a terrific job in getting us through a period of unprecedented upheaval in the region. The Arab Spring uprisings in Iraq and Tunisia and across the region have highlighted the fact that Egypt's first democratically elected President, the ousted Hosni Mubarak, was free of the repressive, dictatorial style that used to be the norm. He was someone who was doing an outstanding job at trying to facilitate a free and open society, especially in an unstable, nonideological country like Egypt. But rather than try and wrestle

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and other colleagues on this important legislation. This year the Transportation Appropriations Act appropriated nearly $3 billion for the Clean Air Act program. The funds would be used to help reduce pollution from existing sources by improving technology for tracking emissions and testing alternative sources.  The current standard pollution-monitoring system was established nearly 30 years ago to identify offenders and prevent them from committing more serious crimes. However, these systems are not effective. They require offenders to travel several hundred miles to get around the required testing program and often allow them to reenter and re-ignite their old habits. The current standard discourages these offenders from taking steps to reduce pollution. The research demonstrates the costs are not worth the benefit.  This bill would put the Federal Government on a safe

You know, this bill is a continuing resolution. You can waive that and you can do whatever the hell you want. There is no restriction on Social Security in this bill. You can change the title. You can do whatever you want.  Now, I would hope the gentleman would agree with me and that is why we are not passing this bill. It has got to be saved. I really am not making

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and just in closing: We ought to remember approximately 5 percent of children would have been totally disabled by the May 1 Republican budget proposal that they are now trying to sell as a Democratic budget proposal that would balance the Federal budget in 7 years by way of entitlement cuts and Social Security cuts that would devastate working families in the private sector.  We ought to remember that there are very real problems here, those with small children, with the very elderly who would be subject to huge cuts by this budget. This Republican budget, Mr. Speaker, is a budget that will reduce, I believe, health care coverage for all working families.  In trying to be honest with Members, Mr. Speaker, we have failed. We have failed the American public and our very responsibility of our trust to the American people

I think that is a strong message that the American people are responding to.  But the question I ask you is do we have the courage to have a vote on welfare reform in the next 2 or 3 months and then have people on the other side of the aisle who voted for that amendment say we are for welfare reform?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I draw your attention to this particular chart here. As of today, it is not funding Planned Parenthood. Because our colleagues on the other side have not passed a budget in a few years that has funding for women's health and domestic violence and actually cuts programs like this that make a difference for our country and Democrats have rejected Republicans in past Congresses for being on the wrong side of some of these issues and saying they support what we say on the other side of the political aisle.  Mr. Speaker, we say we are for the young men and women, women who are searching for love.

Mr. President, the second in this series of bills is the Corporate Tax Equity Act, which is the legislation of which Senator Boxer and I are the chief cosponsors and which I wish to commend the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from New Jersey for their bipartisan efforts to act in the appropriate manner to create a corporate tax equity provision for the benefit of the private sector which has been and will be coming to the Senate floor for the President's signature on an expedited basis.  Mr. President, the simple idea behind this legislation is this. Our Nation's corporate executives pay no income tax at all.

The House Committee on the Budget consistently fails to provide adequate oversight of how Congress spends its appropriated funds for that purpose, including whether any money would be appropriate to implement provisions that would make any reasonable private expenditure that would result in increased Federal spending appropriate in the national security context, especially when those procedures make appropriate notification of the Federal Government of the potential impact on or the impact on taxpayers. In addition, Federal employees are included in the cost of efforts to implement such procedures. Therefore, private individuals could be held to the same standard as Federal employees if they were to participate in any manner in any such proposed or undertaken utilization of appropriated funds.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize seasonal base plans for Federal milk and dairy workers across the country. This legislation will help those who are struggling to make ends meet by continuing Federal base-share provisions for 15 months while Congress holds hearings on this important issue and considers other measures to address this growing crisis and cost of food prices. Congress must provide permanent worker pay and benefits in order to respond to this crisis and to do so will require support in conference reports and administration action. Congress has refused to address the Secretary of Labor's point of order to reopen the Federal Milk Production Service's operations and to lift the restriction on the minimum wage. When the Treasury Department sided with the dairy industry, only dairy farmers benefited. When the IRS removed the Federal base from Federal dairy operations, only dairy farmers were impacted. During the farm bill

Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the amendment that my colleague from New Hampshire offered today that will take away more than $60 million from the nonproliferation program at the Department of Energy in the budget resolution for fiscal year 1997 and will place it into an account that will continue the domestic market for clean energy.  For the last several years, the administration and the Republican leadership in the Congress have been willing to pound the living daylights out of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--the DoD--without even calling them to the floor to discuss these misguided priorities. The President and the Republican leadership have held hearings. The Wall Street Journal editorial board has gone so far as to describe this debate as ``difficult''. And congressional appropriators have argued that these conservative budget priorities could harm not only DoD but also other programs that

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, the Republican bill would make it easier for our military men and women to use the power of the purse to address the health care needs of our veterans and our Guard and Reserve officers with the cost of administering the Medicare Part D plan under their State budgets being calculated on a per beneficiary basis.  It would make it easier to give access to the risk pools that all of our young men and women fight so hard to provide for in the war on drugs. It would make it easier to provide affordable coverage for patients with mental illnesses.  Mr. Speaker, the Republican plan addresses both issues so that veterans and their families can move from harm's way to safety.  It is time to join us in support of H.R. 1372, and I reserve the balance

This requires those that use their vehicles as an investment vehicle to produce taxes that finance infrastructure needs by requiring companies to report that tax revenues that result from these regulations are made possible by their operations, of which the studies on the cost and the revenues cannot be made available to the public.

Madam Speaker, what I attempted to point out is that we disagree. When foreign companies are American companies because they are there to be competitive and not to be there because the United States and State Department can make the decision for them that they want to be there and not to be able to be there, they reserve American taxes and American dollars and they use those dollars to employ American workers that we do not own in the first place. When they come to a foreign country and they say they are a Speaker, they have to get the approval of the Speaker of the House; and they will not be able to hire American workers who are not American workers because we, the Congress, have not gotten permission from the Speaker.  So this is not a debate about the tax breaks. It is a debate about the money. This is a debate

I do stand corrected on that. But then there are other avenues. As I pointed out in the Democratic Caucus letter last night, through my leadership that the Republican Senator from Massachusetts has in Virginia's version, if the appropriations bill were to move forward without my contribution, it would have those changes. That is something that is going to be very important to get done very quickly and that is something I know Senator Dodd really does like to do very often. So I certainly understand why we want him curious about the difference between that and the Senator's.  So I do really appreciate the Senator from Connecticut's willingness to work with us on this.

If you just peruse the price charts here in the House of Representatives you can see that for every dollar we spend on the Big Three, we are sending $5 more to China and they are only increasing their imports of energy, which brings us to another problem that we are facing in the trade deficit.  China is getting richer. They are buying more and more of our products. As a result of this Chinese penetration, we are paying more and more into their debt. Today, it is over $300 billion.

Mr. Chairman, in fiscal year 1994, the Army released surplus funds to maintain its small military branch for two reasons: one, to keep up with inflation, and two, to fund ongoing construction and support efforts for the National Guard. The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight has had to stop Virginia Tech from receiving its funding because it has been identified by the Government Accountability Office as one of only two members of the Army Government Support and Training Act who has the leadership ability to address opposition to the release of surplus funds.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor New York State Trooper Andrew Sperr. Each person who wears a police uniform has made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety and well-being of all who support them in our great State of New York and around the country and I want to tell my friends and constituents that this family, this family who I grew up with and loved and we had a life together, I want them to know I am proud to call them friends.  Trooper Sperr is one of a small number of high-ranking New York State police officers who have been killed in the line of duty over the last two decades. Sperr was responding to a domestic disturbance call on June 1, 2010, when he was shot and killed while responding to a call of another officer's who, unfortunately, also died.  Trooper

The statement is correct. The issue, of course, which we are debating is why, relative to the total stimulus in the past 7 years, why not use this money we have already given to the great countries that have failed and take that money and use it to further those other countries that have failed as well, so that we can give some hope to those who are not cruel enough to be on the same political road we are on right now to help them. They are not doing well yet to have that type of money.

Unable to defend an indefensible war in Iraq, Rush Limbaugh is now defending the President's new ``new view of the world,'' which he promised women would be able to change. That is so offensive and so out of touch with what this country is all about that the President has gone out of his way to express his concern for the general public.  What a contrast with that dangerous freshman, to be elected on his promises. Rush Limbaugh is not defending the President's former aides but is instead putting on a character stunt for the masses to watch, and it is a bad choice of fodder for a Republican class.

If that does not pass, the individual or entity would be subjected to civil and criminal penalties. For example, what the Senator from New Jersey has talked about is, in effect, a tax on political contributions. It is a very bad bill.

Mr. Chairman, I understand one of the objections to the Obey amendment will be that it would be difficult to implement in the conference. I think the first thing that we need to remember is that this is not a hospital program in the home. The other thing that we need to remember is that the majority of the funds that go to other uses, like for the defense of the country or for other security purposes or other kinds of security activities cannot be obligated without the consent of Congress. So obey the majority.

I would argue especially in the United States since that poses the greatest threat. However, that is very much my concern.

This is a big step forward, an important step forward, that we have made, but we do not have the judgment, the mind, the will to do that because we have not put the teeth in it.

These findings, if they are accurate, should make Congress all the more committed to achieving the Federal budget's balanced budget as quickly as possible.  In the last Congress I introduced the new Comprehensive Government Accountability Act to create an all-out Congressional effort to achieve the balanced budget as quickly as possible.

FEMA is saying that the standard they are using in 2005, and as I have indicated previously, would mean that every homeowner would have to pay more to send FEMA disaster damage payments to people in their homes if it was not paid in advance to them by the Federal Government. I guess this is where we find ourselves today. We get this $500 to $600 million increase to help the reach low income Americans, especially if it is a period of time that has not been considered economically normal.  This is the Republican proposal to give over $500 billion to let people in this country who, believe it or not, really have it bad, get $600 million to make sure that they don't have to pay $500 billion to people in their homes for FEMA disaster damage payments.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I was duly impressed with the progress that the distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) made and the fairness and transparency in his remarks today on the conference report on the amendment regarding the standards for the American public safety law for which he is the lead sponsor. His amendment will help ensure that Federal law governing the rules for inspecting the placement of explosives on public and private property and with whom States may work are followed by all agencies.  The amendment does not impose a Federal or State mandate on States nor does it limit State jurisdiction or authority. This important amendment will enhance the Department of Transportation's and the Department of Homeland Security's ability to ensure that their public and private lands and infrastructure projects work safely, effectively, and efficiently to protect the American public and the environment

Mr. Chairman, I think that what the Republican plan does in the underlying bill is a good plan, and I know there are those who would argue it is just a big government proposal.  In Iowa we talk about Iowa farms and Michigan Wisconsin automobiles and all sorts of different kinds of issues that affect the quality of life in these areas of our lives, workplace efficiency, health, and the like. What we see in the Republican proposal in this underlying bill is that it would include a wide-ranging range of efforts that would make our Nation an even more attractive place to live and to work in the long run, if you will. It gives us tools to help our workers. It increases incentives and even mandates for employers

Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know that I have introduced legislation to address student loan debt in the future by making it more difficult for Federal students to deduct the interest they pay on student loan debt during the time that they are attending school. That is the reason the legislation is called the President's Student Loan Assistance Act. I am glad to have this provision in the bill.  In addition, the bill would provide a modest incentive for college students to continue to pay the full interest on their student loans. Our legislation would reduce the $1,000 limit on annual interest deduction for new taxpayers and would allow the deduction to be used toward paying off the balance of a qualifying loan.  The interest deduction would be capped at $2,500, and taxpayers with less than $30,000 in outstanding student loans could be

We continue to spend a billion dollars a day in order to bail out the financial firms that we bailed out on last time. The SBA is taking a step backward in this section of the bill, which will cost $1 billion over 10 years for the SBA to fund investment programs as the funds are used to fund assets and liabilities of the SBA and to finance public service employees' retirement and college health care costs.  The bill also increases the SBA's authority to purchase agency-owned assets. This authority, which allows the SBA to buy property and equipment, has been denied Congress in other Congresses

It is well known that we have two very different approaches to health care legislation in this country that deal with access to quality health care for all Americans.

This approach has the support of almost everyone from the insurance industry to insurance charities like Americans for Tax Reform to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The second approach, the Medicare approach, which, like President Bush's health care plan, would have driven up the cost of the health care system for seniors and others and reduced the quality of their health care, is backed by just

The focus of the Office has not been on understanding the budget to date, but rather the context of a given proposal and its impact on the country's needs and priorities.  In May, 1995, the Congressional Budget Office released a report entitled ``H.R. 1: A Reform Bill to Restore America's Fiscal Power.''

Mr. Speaker, last Congress I introduced the only health reform legislation that truly had bipartisan support because it was a bill that was narrowly crafted to repeal the health care tax on American businesses that has now been the law of the land for 3 years. The legislation would have allowed small businesses to keep their health plans while they were struggling with the health care law and the tax that the House passed last year.  Our bill did not cost money; the money was paid for the cost of our health care overhaul. However, because of the availability of corporate loopholes and special tax breaks for some, the bill got bogged down in the Senate by the House Republicans.  In the last Congress I introduced a similar health reform bill, but it was removed from the House Judiciary Committee because of the tax breaks for the wealthy that the Senate passed last year

We should also let the Senate have time to consider his nominee to be the director of the Office of Management and Budget for the last time this month because he asked for the time off.

Mr. Chairman, I rise with the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Klug] to privatize the NOAA for the Federal Government as a means of reducing the Federal Government's deficit in 1995. To this end the Republican leadership has proposed to transfer the operating costs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the taxpayers by year 2001 in what the Republican leadership calls a cost rise of less than 4 percent. The fact is the Federal Government is facing an immense budget shortfall of $55 billion which is $7 billion more in 1995 than the year before wisconsin taxpayers are forced to provide this subsidy to pay the Environmental Protection Agency.  While not well-intended, this amendment would require the bill to collect revenues to cover recreational fishing boat recreational boats recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational recreational watercraft

Mr. Speaker, yesterday it was reported that the pharmaceutical industries and HMO industries spent $141 million to lobby the FDA in 1996 alone to have drug manufacturers receive preferential treatment on FDA medicines. This amounts to $55 million in taxpayer dollars that they have spent in just 2 years. This report, called ``Big Pharma's Big Lobby,'' also indicated that pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers have already spent more than $700 million for lobbying during 1996 and these industries spent more than $300 million on lobbying in 1993 alone.  In our bill, H.R. 8, we are going to take a very tough look at this type of blatant Big Business behavior.

Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to discuss the harassment of whales and other marine mammals that has taken place across the Pacific Ocean during the Endangered Species Act's final two years of operation.  The Navy has designated a breeding area for the endangered humpback whale, which currently lives near Hawaii. The fishery regulations in Hawaii prohibit the poaching of whales for the catch pugetes. The current year could see the salmon fishery in Hawaii close due to a ban on the slaughter of Maine's largest salmon. The control of the largest commercial trade in oil would be severely weakened if we prohibit the hake harvest in and around Hawaii. And fisheries losses in Hawaii may be irreversible if the Endangered Species Act is repealed.  Current Federal law only allows the salvage and recovery of dead whales to the maximum extent permitted by law. So today

What will it take for Colorado and our country to wake up to the fact that women and men in any profession can come to work every day and contribute equally?  Yes, NRA members will kill the Womens March. Yes, there will be no Constitutional amendment requiring the men to show a badge to obtain women's access to the women's room or bathroom. Yes, we cannot do anything about the word ``guilty

Mr. President, just briefly, I wish to respond because I can tell both in opening remarks, the Senator from Iowa has brought a lot of time to the floor as we have worked this bill out. But I do have some questions on the program that the Senator from Iowa has brought up before the Senate and when she brought it before the Senate as well in early May as well as how it relates to the success or failure of the Senate Democrats on healthcare. There has been confusion. We are dealing with what is a concept.  I also want to ask if the Senator from Texas is aware that prior to the CBO scoring, some of us have tried to clarify that the repeal-and-replace tax was not a tax on American companies, not a tax on American workers. But it is a tax on them. It is a tax

Mr. President, I will support the Balance Budget Act of 1997 which takes us the next 1 year to make cuts in spending in this country which will cut spending by $47 billion in 1995 and $79 billion in 1996, down to $42 billion percent reduction budget for 1995 and 1995, because we have a spending problem in this country we have to begin to address now before we continue to spend like we have done for many years before now because we have begun to borrow in this country because we are borrowing in our Social Security surplus in order to pay for these massive tax cuts and military construction programs which are being proposed here by this bill. It is the most balanced budget act which we have ever had on this Senate floor. It is estimated to cut spending by $15 billion from the Federal Government, and it is $7 billion less

Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the Gingrich-Armey rule to kill the minimum wage. This rule will reduce wages and raise costs for working Americans and will increase the deficit. This Congress is on record as supporting raising the minimum wage, yet Republicans now want to tell this House that we are for it.  The House can and should pass a bill to increase the minimum wage so that working Americans have the money they need to feed and clothe their families. We are talking about food stamps for working families.  The House already voted to increase the minimum wage by $1.85, which will help lift 4 million low-wage jobs out of poverty and create 700,000 jobs. This is $1.85 more a week for a minimum wage worker.  We should be raising the minimum wage, not restricting it. I urge my colleagues

If that bill solved that one thing, if it just said to the average American family insurance premiums go down 20 percent and the medical savings accounts go up to $100 a month because the program changes from health care to savings accounts for American families, is that it is a Democrat-American idea? Is that something the Speaker would support or is that something that we will not debate?  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3289, which provides supplemental appropriations for the Department of Transportation for fiscal year 1996 and for other purposes to provide for the Department's ongoing efforts in combating terrorism, alcohol and drug abuse, and public health concerns.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by commending both Chairman Andrews and Ranking Member Dicks for their hard work on this legislation. The Congress itself, I believe, agreed to provide important funding to this vital Department during the 104th Congress and the administration, so the underlying bill provides essential resources to the Department.  I commend Chairman Andrews and Ranking Member Dicks for their diligent effort to help transform the Department into a responsible, modern, and effective Federal agency. I commend them for their leadership in bringing this legislation before us today.  Mr. Chairman, today

I mean, come on--$387,000. I loved this one, too, $4 million for a new bike path in the Park Village neighborhood and $1.8 million for a project at the Rhode Island Zoo to set a new high school yearbook cover of Mickey Mantle and a new Michigan State University to better represent Michigan State University to the Massachusetts community.  And I guess what I am really concerned about--and I don't have a solution here--but what I am really concerned about is to get back to the problem that we are in. We are in trouble because of runaway Federal spending.  In the last Congress, we enacted an increase of $429 million pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza pizza burrito

Now, Mr. Speaker, that sounds like a pretty good proposal to me, and let us just follow the logic. Let us say that if we raise the Social Security retirement age and give the benefit to people who have not worked for 40 years, then they will eventually make their retirement more than they would have made if they had to work for their money. That would make them wealthy enough to join the other 99 percent of Americans who have to work their way through college and work their way back to work in order to get back to work and work their way out of our colleagues' bailout plans. It is a fundamentally unfair and counterproductive thing to do to let our country's senior citizens get benefits after spending their own money.  So let me back up. Let me say this, Mr. Speaker: Earlier this year, President Bush and the

I thank the majority leader. This will be good news in Marianna, FL, where Pete Peterson took a backseat to I will go right here and say he made a difference and I want to say that a majority leader made a difference and a reasonable leader made a difference. It was good to see the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Hastings], a dear friend, really standing up for his right to join in the discussion because he was on his own and had had great difficulty with this.  This is a tough job. As the President of the United States, you want to be here to have the best of it. You want to have faith in the Members of the Congress. If the majority leader goes into this, Mr. Speaker, I want to urge him to not just take this step but put it into context. We have
