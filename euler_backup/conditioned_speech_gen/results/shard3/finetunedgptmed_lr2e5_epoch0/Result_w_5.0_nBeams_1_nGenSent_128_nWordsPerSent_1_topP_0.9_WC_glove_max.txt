Mr. Chairman, it is with some disappointment that I have to disagree with my colleagues today when they claim that Medicare beneficiaries would not be able to maintain adequate insurance protection under their personal policy if the plan is changed to the same plan they already have as an employer. No Government programs can protect the health of a taxpayer from a Federal mandate or tax on the private insurance plans that cover his or her health needs but not his or her individual plan. What this means is that most of the people on Medicare cannot pay the price of either their own plan or their employer's plan as the cost of both continue to rise. Without the guaranteed coverage provided by the private

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I want to make sure we are clear on the fact that there is nothing in this budget that will cause us to put more money in the trust fund, the deficit management funds. There will be no more cuts in the general fund or any of the nondefense discretionary programs or any of those that are supposed to be funded. There will be no more than we would get in last year's year of obligation under the law in this Congress to pay all the obligations which they made that year in this year of obligation to their respective States under the law and this year of obligation under this agreement

The amendment would prevent the Secretary of State from exercising authority under this amendment, if he can conclude that the language under this amendment is so broadly and broadly worded that the Secretary of State would be prevented from implementing that authority unless and until Congress provides that Congress has provided the State Department with the authority to implement that authority under this amendment. It does not say that the Secretary of State should not do that and should not do it because Congress has not provided the State Department with the authority to do that. That is not the point of the amendment here.  The point is that what the Secretary of State

<|endoftext|>Abstract To understand this debate, you need to understand the logic of the fact that the President proposed to put 90 percent of the Federal budget in deficit reduction and all but the first of those cuts would apply to the next 7 years. That means he is proposing, to reduce the deficit--the Federal budget--by 9 percent, and then all of a sudden he turns around and proposes to cut the Pentagon by 31 percent.  Not only does this increase the national debt by $19 billion per year, it also increases the national debt, as we know now, by $1,000 per person for every dollar that we put into the Federal

Madam President, today I wish to honor two of our Nation's great Catholic veterans of World War II and World War I. All of them came from Cincinnati, Ohio. In fact, on Wednesday evening, October 16, when President Obama was sworn in at the National Cemetery at Arlington National Cemetery and before the Senate, I was making a phone call to one of the two troops who had come from my State of Indiana. They were 10 years old at the time they died, so I asked what they were doing before they went off to war. One of the two gave me a short version of the news they were coming back from the war and then

It is a blueprint for the future of U.S. energy production because it leaves Congress in the dust and fails to take into account the huge profit that we already pay for oil and gas in the United States.

The reason that one of the generals, the gentleman from Virginia, the Senator from Virginia said that was because they had nothing to do with the legislation that passed in the Senate that he said would have set up these bonuses in South Carolina.

And he has said several times that the country is in trouble because of the failure of the Democrat leadership to lead on any of these issues.  In the absence of the President himself to explain these issues and specific leadership commitments from the Republican Party in the United States House of Representatives and the White House,

What we hear Republicans say is that we want to have the reform, but we do not have the money to actually get it done. The truth is, we have enough of the President's health care plan and we do not have enough of what we have to pay for the program. We simply do not have the money. We could provide the quality care we wanted if we had enough money, but we do not

It has been very moving to see the Senate continue to take its historic support for the troops with the support of our Republican colleagues and the support of our House of Representatives Members. This support, which many think is going to be short-lived, is important for our troops and for our troops families. This is good news and support for our men and women in uniform.  We need to begin moving this Iraq funding now as soon as possible to ensure our troops receive the care

As we all know, this is an important step in the fight against the budget cuts contained in this legislation and the health care reform law that will be signed into law as part of the National Affordable Health Care Act. So far this is what has been agreed to in the budget resolution, and it is a step we should support, even though some of the other important legislation in this bill has been left out of this agreement and that could be the difference between victory and defeat in the coming days and weeks.

We voted on an amendment to the House rules that would have provided funding for our veterans to medical aid by giving them some funding to go to their doctors. This is fundamentally different than what we did in the Senate with the Department of Veterans Affairs programs which ultimately did not get funding because the Senate appropriations bills got stuck in the Senate bureaucracy. I voted against it because that would allow the VA to continue to

Mr. Speaker, we have been in discussion for some time about why we have a problem in education in the United States of America and how we can do better for students in this country and give the American taxpayers and families the educational opportunity that they deserve.  Earlier this year the Federal Government announced that it was reducing Federal funding for the free and reduced meals programs in order to pay for President Clinton's education initiatives at that time in the school year 2002. The Federal Government says that the free and reduced meals program was terminated because the administration did not get the money for it until December. We thought that that was a very important initiative because we were concerned that

And to suggest that maybe that would not be appropriate is really not the appropriate statement, given that every one of these amendments that were voted on or the amendments that preceded them

Mr. President, for years I have tried to see to it that we can provide more opportunity for the American people to be able to hold themselves to more accountability in our elections to get things done for them so that we can help them get better paychecks and better quality of life. I make no apology for standing up and saying, yes, America's working families deserve better than this.  Recently, the Committee on Finance reported two bills that I cosponsored, the Federal Election Commission Accountability Act, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board Reform Act. The three bills are now on the Senate floor. I have worked in a bipartisan way to bring them to

It is in no way designed to be interpreted as destroying our current Medicare or the ability of the insurance companies to keep the Medicare system solvent. It simply says if the plans that are currently in the program change in a way that reduces the maximum guaranteed benefit amount and would reduce the program, it may be a good idea, if you so choose, to include a way to help maintain the current system and cut the out-years from what we have already had in the plan

However, for millions of those families the program they depend upon to get their paycheck is not guaranteed to be in the process of being funded. Without access to the program, these working families would have no access to the child care needed to help pay for child care for their children and provide them with needed educational support so that they can get ahead in life. This is not what the American people want.  By striking funding for this important program, this body is placing the priorities of the majority of the American

We had the debate on this legislation that was held before that one, where a group of lawyers said they would make some reasonable changes in it. It's called Thomas's law, because those doctors would not want to change it, and there was a huge reduction in the number of cases that would be filed. This legislation does go a step further. It reduces the number of appeals and has the existing court structure in place so that patients

Mr. President, I have some questions about this amendment which was offered by Senators Kennedy and Landrieu.  It deals with some of the problems that some people have with the process of management of some of the land that has been given to the Forest Service. This amendment requires that the Forest Service review the management plan, including how it is used and whether to move ahead with a final management plan for a large piece of land which is very special for the forested areas in this country and I think is a wonderful example of the whole concept of land trust.  I want to ask you a couple of questions about this amendment because I think it makes

If you want to find a reason why you should vote ``no'' on this amendment--or if you simply want to make sure that the whole process does not destroy the American dream that is at stake--you can look no further than the case of the Wall Street Journal today. The Wall Street Journal's editorial today expresses the view that the

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We all hear about Medicare Part D being taken away from seniors in order to pay for this program. We don't hear about that this year because of the cost of doing nothing in this continuing resolution. In addition to what it is taking away from seniors, it also is taking away from seniors and their doctors who are having to pay premiums and be reimbursed more for drugs they used years ago than what they should be able to get for a year. So we're making it more expensive for them and their families who have already paid a lot more than they should for years of their
