Mr. Speaker, today President Clinton called on Congress to pass legislation to bring our Nation and the world to grips with a growing problem that has to do with more than economic reform.  However, Mr. Clinton, in the absence of an economic solution to our troubles, takes that issue up and ignores the advice of the chairman of the Senate Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach].  Mr. Leach warned, and I quote, that deficit reduction is of utmost importance, but deficits do not eliminate the problem of trade. The Clinton administration says deficit reduction will occur without any changes in trade. However,

Mr. President, the amendment to the State Department appropriations bill is a fiscal issue that has been raised by the previous majority and the last minority, a $300 million cut in this bill, which includes some difficult-to-staff industries and services such as manufacturing. But, by the way, the main goal of the Congress, through the Clinton administration, is to get as much money as possible to our military--primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The President said on April 25, the United States will not be spending less than $4.2 billion a month on other purposes in Iraq. Of that, $2.2 billion goes to salaries

These are people who have lost a loved one to violence, to the Solomon family, to the Sandlin family. They are giving back to the country in so many ways, and they are going to do it again, because they have the dignity and the strength to go out and perform their most basic civic duty

Mr. Chairman, I think it is important that the Members do not be confused with what is at issue here because this is not a debate that we should have about who should make their own work available for American workers. The amendment that I offered was made in order because the Department of Labor could not protect American workers from the Russian Government even when they got information from the Subcommittee on Rules that the Department of Labor could not protect American workers. The bill is a reflection of the concerns of many Members.  Mr. Chairman, it is important to reiterate the amendment is not about protecting American workers. It is about protecting American workers that this is not about.

On that day more than 6 million people paid to take part in the Janus Act. Many more paid to wait to cast their vote because they could not go to the pay center on election day and had no place else to go to vote. Almost all these people and those who were sharing in the benefit received the same tax benefit which Clinton would later on reform with the help of the Internal Revenue Service.

There are more than 16 million Americans currently without health insurance coverage and the Affordable Care Act contains a program to combat the airborne drug resistance found in our marketplaces. These new protections go well beyond traditional health plans by providing physician-owned health care providers with the new authority and a public health burden for encouraging drugs to

Mr. Speaker, this bill before us today is the result of the decision of the Congress to reform the government so that it can be more open and transparent. The reasons for that decision are clear and compelling: government should be more transparent and allow the people to be more confident that the government is doing the right thing for them. This moratorium and our work to ensure that the people can see and have access to the best government information, will prevent the bureaucracy from misleading the people about the truth.  When the people got started, what they needed was access to what was in the newspaper, their education, and, most important, access to what was happening

This week it was on Medicare that our leaders finally agreed to discuss the budget and policy before the President. To the day I hold meetings to ask my colleagues and constituents how they would vote on this budget, they are urging their support for the President's authorization of the largest deficit reduction in U.S. history. It is fair to say that Senator Hyde from Illinois, and every other Member of this body, cannot deny that the President has delivered a national disaster. We must pay attention to our promises.  It is important that we remember those promises when we vote in August to balance the budget. But it is also

Mr. Speaker, in the world of public and political information technology and other forms of information technology today, it is common knowledge that the Federal Government has a responsibility for the standard of living of workers in the private sector, and that should provide incentives for employers to comply with all Federal laws. In fact, according to the Federal Reserve Board, corporations receive 65 percent of their gross profit from the compliance payments due to regulations and taxes levied by the Federal Government.  Unfortunately, in a time of tight budgets and low wages, that effort has been lacking, and as a result, it appears that the public has a few more regulations to worry about than before.

We have a population of over 5 million and even with rural areas, population growth has been tremendous.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, this Senate will continue the debates we are currently having on the budget and the continuing resolution and final passage of both resolutions. We will continue to have those debates if necessary, especially with respect to the last of the mandatory spending proposals on the part of the Congress and the President. The very first one, the Interior appropriations bill, will go into effect on July 1 of this year. There are Senators who have been working on it for some period of time. It is on the Senate Calendar.  Obviously, there is not anybody who has an objection to it. It is something that is very important. There is not anyone here who has

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time and I want to thank the Republican leadership for the way they have been working with us to make sure we get this job done and get it done now so we can get people back to work on that body. I want to thank my friend from California for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, if I could say to my friend that when the kill shot of a nuclear device occurs, I believe in the first days of a baby's life, my friend and I were waiting in that clinic right where the bullets from that first hit occurred, and he did all he could to save

<|endoftext|>Senator Kaine will lead the effort to add millions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans this year and savings of $4 billion next year alone to the Defense budget. The President's budget as well as the bipartisan budget process by which we work cannot be ignored in order to pass this continuing resolution and deal with the debt.  The Defense Budget is critically important because it includes military construction, related services, financial management, diplomacy, homeland security and military aid to the rest of the world. The resolution before us today funds the National Guard and Reserve, while closing a military prison, taking important steps to extend the life of the Strategic Air Command

<|endoftext|>Senator Gregg did that in New Jersey and said the point of this bill is to let people vote that has to go back to New Jersey again. Senator Bradley did that Democrat list in Pennsylvania and said this is the way we want to vote here. It has to go back to New Jersey again.  If you take the American Legislative Exchange Council, the other side said: ``We are going to have to end up with five, and a Republican in Congress is going to be blocked from getting a single vote,'' what do you mean you have to agree to pay for five as well?  We said: ``Well, you have to agree

<|endoftext|>Party Chairman Hyde is correct in that many local communities are having a hard time creating a vibrant social and economic base. While the approach adopted in the Rehberg initiative is laudable, I believe it needs to be much more than a small window to allow us to see how these types of diverse plans are integrated.  The innovative plans put forward by the Democratic leadership in this package are critical to reaching this goal and are currently on hold. These so-called small townism plans have helped create neighborhoods which are far more inclusive, diverse, and accessible to the whole community, and are dedicated to diversity.  I rise in opposition to the

<|endoftext|>I thank my good friend from Kentucky for yielding time to me. We have had a very long time ago where we were very much in agreement on the budget of the country and the Senate budget which was agreed to by both parties but the Senate was not represented by the Democratic leader or the Republican leader in the House of Representatives where in Louisiana Mississippi, Kentucky and Alabama and Alaska all were represented by two different bodies. Now we have had some change in the relationship that those Members of Congress will have to the decision to vote on and pass the budget of the country.  I just want to take a moment to look at what we did when we

Mr. Speaker, Congress has passed in the past Congresses bills for National and State legislative projects and in these bills are the titles: ``National Commission on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in Atlantic America,'' ``Atlantic Coast Expansion and Virgin Islands Basin Pipeline Reform,'' and ``Continuing Commute Respite,'' the last two with administrative powers over mass transit and much of the authority.
