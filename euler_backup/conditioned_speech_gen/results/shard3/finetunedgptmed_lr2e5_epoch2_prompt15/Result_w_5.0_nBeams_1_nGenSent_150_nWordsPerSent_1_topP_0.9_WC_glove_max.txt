Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was willing to do what it takes to win the fight against the tax and spend Democrat welfare reform legislation that is scheduled to go to the floor this week on the Republican side of the issue. He will not support that legislation because it would remove the cap on the annual tax bill from a citizens' elected tax commissioner, which is the Democratic proposal, and then allow any Democrat or Republican to fill it that he wants to fill it, if he wishes, by another Democratic or Republican candidate. The way he and the President see it, the only people that are in charge are people who do not want to be in charge of this, such as Mr. Solomon or Mr. Chafee. Mr. President, it is a sad day when American businesswoman

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing today to expand renewable energy production by encouraging oil companies to invest in renewable energy production.  I have heard from over 60 of my constituents in South Florida on the need to ensure our investments are also appropriate for the cost of these investments. Despite the fact that we have a long-term need to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, oil companies are again taking advantage of the current tax code and with it the promise of tax loopholes to gain significant tax advantages. For example, this year, the well oil tax break for wind energy is estimated to cost the taxpayers $55 million to $100 million annually, or more than $400 million a year for each well as far as the eye can see. I cannot help but be concerned that, with oil prices

Mr. President, I am proud to recommend a very distinguished West Virginian be confirmed today as the next Secretary of State of the United States. I have had the privilege of serving with Secretary Richardson during all of his almost 30 years in public service in West Virginia. As a Governor and a Secretary of State, Ambassador Richardson has made an outstanding mark. His career has not only prepared him for this significant challenge, but it has also served as a model for his contemporaries to follow. Ambassador Richardson has been a tireless advocate of the West Virginian experience and has recognized that the State of West Virginia, with its history and customs, is the perfect place to lead our Nation forward.  I do not doubt Ambassador Richardson's commitment to excellence and fidelity to his home State of West Virginia and to the principles upon which his administration has been built.

It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Isakson in order to craft a bipartisan and strong legislation in the last year and a half that has been widely supported by everyone who has been involved in the legislation that is before us today.  It is only appropriate that we come to the floor today to honor the victims of this weekend's heinous attack in Santa Barbara.

It has been 2 weeks since General Duvalier has been elected, and he is still unwilling to step down and lay down his command. There is a wonderful thing about democracy.

On that first day of his presidency, the American people responded with a resounding ``yes'' to new ideas and to new leaders to help change Washington and bring fiscal responsibility and a new way of doing business to the Nation's capital.  That bill was the first step in a year long process that will change the way Washington operates for the better. That effort will continue under the leadership of the next President in January of next year. This legislation is no way to continue the status quo and raise the Nation's debt limit or to get Washington back on the right track. We are on the brink of what the American people

So all the $3.7 billion that we are talking about here has not been in dispute.

The BRAC Commission knew about that important work and wanted to make sure our troops had that training and knew what the Army wanted and asked for it at the meeting that they would meet in the Base Closure Commission's conference room after the Secretary's approval to close the base at Carson.  The BRAC Act gives the military the power to make specific decisions on the location of closed military bases. However, a BRAC Commission of this size will not be able to monitor all the bases. In some cases the Secretary may have to veto some base closures. A BRAC Commission with 17,600 members is going to have to work as carefully as the Base Closure Commission does in deciding if a base should close. It would take a great deal of the management authority and the time to establish that each point on the chart is part

Mr. Speaker, what I have come to the floor to talk about is something very important and very significant in my district and the important thing is that you have this elected Republican administration that said: We are going to change the way Washington does business. We are going to put an end to micromanaging people in this House. And I guess what this Republican Congress that we have here that I represent voted to take the first one step to do that is historic. But in the middle of that is what the Wall Street Journal says today. This Wall Street Journal wrote today: ``The Republicans have taken a hard line in the debate over the so-called Wall Street reform bill that will strengthen and soften the limits on corporate social responsibility, while also strengthening the private-sector efforts to protect their interests.''

Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on an amendment offered by the senior Senator from Utah which would strike all of the civil rights language in the conference report to the crime bill.  The amendment would strike that civil rights provision for the first time in the history of the United States Senate and would strike this provision because it has always been the position of the Senator from Utah that civil rights of the people and the rights of the minority should be the preeminent and even the paramount concern of our Nation.  I was here when civil rights provisions were included in the crime bill and the last time I was here was when civil rights provisions were not part of the crime bill.  There was never any question as to whether we were going to get a crime bill passed for the first time in the history of the United States Senate,

If the gentleman will yield, I appreciate the fact he says the Clinton plan was indeed about families having access to health care and it was about jobs. What I think this bill does is it gives the President the unprecedented ability to write anything he wants that is going to reduce the number of children that are uninsured and increase their access to health care and has no strings whatsoever, which is what most of us say that is in it. It simply gives him the ability to do that at any time he wants and do it any way he wants it to be done. That is why he does not need to worry about creating a program that would kill jobs because the bill that the Republicans are talking about has nothing to do with what they are talking about in that regard.

This amendment actually, because it actually takes a look at the poverty studies where we were able to show that in many instances, if we simply define welfare as welfare participation in this country through welfare, that this amendment effectively ends welfare as we know it.  So I appreciate the support of the gentleman and the support of the gentlewoman for this amendment, because it really makes an important point. Welfare is not welfare reform. It is not welfare reform in the sense that welfare is providing people opportunity through work. Welfare is not welfare reform because welfare provides welfare for tax breaks and subsidies that provide money for private businesses, and they provide welfare for

We cannot continue to raise taxes and borrow to make up for the revenue we don't have. The best way to deal with this problem is to start providing the funds needed to pay down the debt, which is why the White House budget, which was voted out of the House Budget Committee last week on a vote of 25 to 3, has included $50 billion more in tax cuts over the next 5 years than the Republican budget proposed.  It does not take a Republican Senator to know that that is simply a cut.

I believe the bill before us today is a fair and just legislation that would address the legitimate concerns of the tribes.

I would like the Senate to have a full and complete opportunity to have a vote on that. We are trying to set the record straight

Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about this outsourcing bill and its tenor. If you have heard that nothing is being done on this outsourcing bill, then you have not been following the facts very well because if you have been watching the news these past 2 days, you will not be able to make that sense out of this bill or the fact that the Pentagon is now saying that only a specific section is needed in order to get the necessary information to the American people for the preparation of our defense. There is a real need for that information for us to know what we need to be prepared for in case of any of these economic challenges that our country is facing.  The fact is that all of these costs are not properly stated as there is not an actual provision in this legislation that will be able to clearly tell us how much our taxpayers

As someone who serves on the American Public Health Association's subcommittee on public health, I do support the general thrust of this resolution. I share the sentiments expressed by the majority about the pressing and critical needs of the people of Bosnia. These issues are of great concern to all of us in the Congress and indeed throughout the world. Yet the threat to our peace is not something we must shrink from.

I have often wondered how he and I might have gotten along so well as colleagues of a highly different persuasion on the other side of the aisle in the Senate and how perhaps we might have even been in the same room together in the halls of this Chamber.

Not only was the bear killed by Federal Government guns, but the State had no problem with it, which is because Louisiana was granted Statehood in 1836.  We had a Statehood period, but we were not permitted to ratify that because of the Federal Government's desire to repress dissent.  Mr. Speaker, this is another example of government having been involved in private property rights issues. We have a program here in the House that attempts to educate the American people on this subject.  We are not granting much in the way of tax breaks for the rich, but this is a good idea.

Mr. Speaker, this bill would respond to one of many significant problems with President Obama's action regarding CAFTA. My constituents are well aware of this problem. Our state is ranked third in the country in trade deficits with foreign countries.  The recent trade negotiations have shown that CAFTA does not impose sufficient sanctions on criminal groups and drug traffickers and that it will increase drug trafficking in the southern hemisphere and other areas in which human rights abuses are rampant and where labor and other rights abuses continue to take place.  Indeed, one of the biggest problems with the CAFTA is that it would unfairly punish some of the most vulnerable in the world, including children and migrant workers. If this provision is enacted into law, foreign workers in the United States would be denied the right to organize and bargain for better working conditions in the workplace and

Last week, the Senate passed legislation to do just that with the exception of the farm bill rule. Today we will take another important step toward providing meaningful reform through the adoption of a resolution offered by Senators Snowe, Voinovich, Dorgan, Coburn, Sessions, Grassley, Brownback, Bennett, Durbin, and Gillibrand that sets a good example of a sound regulatory reform measure in this body.  This measure will be offered under the rule of the Senate by the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, and will ensure that this body will exercise strong oversight of all nominees by allowing for an up-or-down vote on nomination

The bill also requires the Office of the Securities and Exchange Commissioner to provide 1-year reports to Congress on the cost and benefits of the mandates passed by Congress.

For more than 40 years Congress has provided a guaranteed 30 percent increase in benefits for Medicare beneficiaries who choose to participate in this plan. That is the way it should be. The plan we are voting on today allows seniors who want to take advantage of the system to do so and that is the way it should be.

So if we are going to be spending money in 1996 to get welfare reform passed this year for the 1996 fiscal year we have more money than any other year in the last five Congresses for the entire Federal Government for the entire period of 1996.

Mr. Chairman, a few minutes ago I met with a number of high school students in our district to tell them how much I will support the extension of job training and the apprenticeship program and work program and the Job Corps Program because I believe those are the things that make America more competitive in the global marketplace of the 21st century. We need to work together to address the problem of the high cost of energy and the high cost of health care, of the high cost of these two problems at the same time. We need to look at the number of jobs created, the number of individuals we are increasing unemployment for each and every day that we are not working.  My bottom line is, it does not make any sense to make the Federal Government, the Federal Government, the Federal Government its top priority. I say that because

Mr. President, I think we have the agreement. I think I did ask unanimous consent to put it in the desk.  Mr. President, the Senate will now proceed to consideration of the budget resolution. Under the consent agreement, at 2:15 p.m., there will be a period of morning business for 60 minutes, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, and the time equally divided between the two managers of the resolution. I hope that will be fairly routine for the morning business.  The order provides for disposition of pending amendments, as the Senate proceeded from the budget resolution. There will be a vote on the adoption of the budget resolution at 2:30 p.m.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

As Senator Heflin has said, many of those organizations asked for the special authorization for a safe and legal environment where they could develop and implement programs that worked against the terrorists or helped them develop more sophisticated methods of operations.  During the course of the subcommittee hearings we heard from leaders of the nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations who testified that they believed they had an important role to play in the response to terrorism and that they did not need special authorization.

Mr. Chairman, later today, some of our colleagues plan to offer amendments to this bill that will try to undermine the current tort reform legislation, the Protect America Act. While many of these amendments may be mischaracterizations of the bill as it is now written, the real aim of these amendments is to make the current tort reform law even weaker by making these amendments permanent in any future reauthorization of the law, for example, of the General Services Administration which we have before us today. This would be a major mistake and would provide real problems to all of the American people as they get the bill in the new year.

I am pleased to introduce the Farm Debt Limit Extension Act of 2007, a bill to authorize the Federal Government to finance payments to farmers to extend the maximum credit limit for loans into which farm payments are applied. The goal of this bill is to protect farmers from additional prepayment penalties if they default on loans.  Past farm bills and the recent farm bill authorize credit limit extensions. This year's farm bill authorizes the maximum credit limit for the GSA's General Farm Credit program for 6 years. It allows the GSA to make small amounts of payments to farmers that is commensurate with how much the farmer should make in annual payment.  Farmers must be careful in how they apply for and pay credit limit extensions. The payment limitations they must

I have seen welfare expand the hand of government to put a lot of people in a position where there are not any limits, even in their plans of being able to get money for themselves, even if they want to be able to go out and work and live their own life and leave the welfare rolls. The fact is that no matter what the age of the child is, the fact is that they are going to have to pay taxes now because they are getting benefits even if they are less than half their age at the time they are receiving welfare benefits. So the fact of the matter is that, if a person wants

I believe that we must give people in this country the opportunity to return to their homes.   Angola has developed a policy of de facto legal segregation in its borders that has devastated its agricultural sector.

While it has been noted that the regulatory agencies in the past have been of the best quality and compliance with Federal regulations, there has been the attempt in recent years to shift the regulatory agencies from the archaic practices of the past into the new world of an information superhighway with regulations imposed on the American people in a foreign, unresponsive world.

This year, after nearly 1,000 pages of stimulus legislation, now, all we are seeing is another increase in the debt.

They have been the basis of the Nation's law enforcement and public health for many years, and Congress has the responsibility to maintain the existing law. We cannot afford to let our respect for the environment and our recognition of the duty to protect it erode.

And when you bring this issue up that we face in this House, it seems to me that we are looking at one of the most pressing issues that we face with this country. It is not the economy of the United States of America but it is a much more important economy to so many across the world. This is a problem that is going to affect so many people in the future and that we are going to need to do more to put into place a market-based economy that is going to drive the demand for that dollar that we can get back from this world and

Mr. Chairman, before I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn), let me say that I know that we are all trying to make the best bill that we can. But I want to express some concerns about this so-called fast track proposal that is going to come out of the other body.  Because of the changes that are going to be made in the proposal for the agricultural trade agreement that is before us, farmers and consumers across this country are going to have to be tested. That is what the Fast Track bill would do in essence is make farmers and consumers across this country more vulnerable to price controls in the agricultural trade agreements that are going to be before us because there is going to be a lot of activity going on within this very agreement that would require that farmers and consumers be tested so that they are not required to bear

Mr. Speaker, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the public a report on the fiscal year 1998 enacted committee budget resolution. For the first time the Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the public the financial statement of the Congress, issued earlier this year on November 3 of this year. I commend Chairman Gregg for his cooperation and amendment to the budget resolution that resulted in this report. Chairman Gregg's amendment not only provides timely information to the public on the budgetary status of the Congress but helps to serve as an unquestioned basis for congressional debate.  Chairman Gregg did not support the appropriation of funds for the committee and he therefore did not support our earlier amendment in the Senate budget resolution which would have made the committee's fiscal year 1998 revenue estimates available to the public for the first time. Chairman Gregg supported this amendment

In particular, the Director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a very tough role to fill when it comes to rural development and agriculture programs, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has demonstrated a great deal of focus on these issues. She has worked very hard and successfully to promote the importance of ensuring that farmers are well served by federal programs that help them do better in the market.

Could the Senator imagine what would be the reaction of some of the local communities in America if they learned that the utilities in their local area had been supplying the powerplant operators with large quantities of highly enriched uranium for many years, used in weapons production and other purposes of nuclear power generation? If the utilities were to stop supplying these weapons, the terrorist attacks which might occur on the power

For too many family farmers and ranchers across my district and across the country to give their pets away for free is not only financially ruinous for them but it can be very difficult to have enough money in the bank to pay the veterinarian for your pet.

That is our very responsibility and that is the purpose of this rule and the purpose of the amendment in the nature of a substitute.

After extensive consultation with emergency management officials and representatives of the Pacific insular states, I have decided to proceed with this urgent project because of concerns about the current situation with the drought-prone western Pacific coast.  Currently the Bureau of Reclamation is requiring Federal agencies to use water for this project if necessary to provide emergency situations. The project would be complete in fiscal year 1996 and in fiscal year 1998. The water could be used to maintain water supplies to 30,000 displaced people.  This project is not controversial to me and the other affected States. It is simply a matter of when it should be completed. I expect that the Board of Supervisors will support this project because we should not have a bottleneck to water projects that should have been completed months ago.  We have to understand the issue before we get started and we have to

Mr. President, over the weekend the administration announced its decision to impose trade sanctions beginning on September 16 on China and the People's Republic of China for manipulating the value of its currency. Over the last decade the Chinese economy has seen a dramatic growth in the amount of its currency and currency-related services that it provides to the global market. This has allowed China to become the largest importer of American goods and services and to be one of the largest foreign competitors for our exports in the software and computer industry in the world. This has created a far greater need to exchange its currency for ours. The Chinese economy is now more advanced and the rules of the international system of exchange have significantly changed and will continue to evolve with respect to the value of the Chinese yuan as a world reserve currency.

This House should be providing the critical services and resources that veterans deserve by passing the veterans appropriations bill this year. Instead, the Republican majority is using the regular Veterans' Affairs appropriations process to fight the Obama administration at every turn. Today's vote should be a step in the right direction.  Rather than use a regular appropriations process to provide for the important needs of the veterans that our Nation has entrusted to our care, the majority used its House Armed Services Committee to use House rules to delay the VA construction and renovation of its new medical facility on the campus of the University of New Mexico. This decision is even more outrageous than any possible delays we can make to give more veterans access to care. Instead of standing up to the White House on their plans for

This conference report provides more than $1 billion in funding for our economic development program. This is more than half the amount requested by the President for fiscal year 1995 and we should all be very pleased about this action. This funding should not come as a surprise because over the past 8 years, the program has been marked by low participation.  During the past year the President has announced an increase of $140 million over last year's funding level for economic development projects and the President has proposed in his budget request a down payment of $25 million for new economic development measures. This funding level reflects the request of President Clinton for economic assistance programs and initiatives that are essential to help turn around the Nation's economic decline

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to note that we are very close now to a consent agreement which will be making in order amendments in a few minutes which are based on the bill that we are considering here on the House floor today. I want to start with a special recognition to the chairman of the committee for all the work that he has done and the work that the ranking member has done in the debate on this bill on this side of the aisle and also in the work that the staff and the Senator from Massachusetts have done on the very large sum of money that they have been able to put into the bill, which has allowed us to have a very reasonable amount of time to complete this bill on the floor today. I just want to thank the staff and the Senator very much for the way they have

Mr. President, just to conclude, this is really a very mild thing to ask. I have talked to him all day today to make sure that we agree to this amendment that would take money that we would give to child care to go into the risk allowance for adults to use for children and would work out a way so we could have the same kind of progress on the incentive that would be in the bill as we have that has gone to the Finance Committee so far with respect to tax credit reform. We are still working on the bill on that side. But he said we could accept the amendment. We would accept the amendment without having to fight any more amendments on this bill.  I say to the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee I am willing to accept the amendment and work out a way so the legislation can pass,

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would point out simply that the language of this bill that I am talking about here simply says that States may not transfer Federal funds or make grant applications that allow an agency to use Federal funds for abortion as long as the agency did not withhold abortion funding or abortion-related matters from its Medicaid eligibility decisions or refused the request of Medicaid not to pay for abortion services from those same States' Medicaid eligibility decisions.  So it would not prohibit it. It would prohibit the specific kinds of things that are in this bill that would allow a State to deny abortion funding or abortion-related matters to its Medicaid beneficiaries, and I think that this amendment simply clarifies that the States would not be able to use the Medicaid formula for those purposes.  So the fact that we are making this argument here only for the

This is not the way to go. I do not think there is anything in here that says that any payments would be made to the Department of Energy.  My statement is that if we go back to the language that was in the committee report and what the Department of Energy has now made available for that purpose, this is not even a credible guarantee that there will be no subsidy at all in the future. In fact, it does not even hold out any hope of any future subsidy. I think it is very important to pay more attention to this and make sure that we get the contract right for America and get it right for the taxpayers

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and Senator Stevens in sponsoring legislation that will provide for an additional 400,000 children in school to have all their financial support available to them and their families without tuition reductions or other reductions in school services.  What this legislation is all about is giving students a much better chance to continue their education by making the additional loan payments they need to stay in school and keep the schools open. As the Senator from Maine has said so many times, our $245 billion student loan crisis is the single greatest shortcoming in the Nation's education system. No one should have to fight their way through school or keep trying because their child cannot afford the very basic college education he or she needs to become productive members of our society.

Rather, this bill says that the Secretary of State should take every appropriate action to stop this President from such an Executive order.  Today is a time of continued global demand for economic and military aid to the People's Republic of China, but the demand for that support has grown much faster than our military has been able to respond to that demand. The people of the former colony of Burma are demanding that the United States and its allies make an effort to lift the U.S. economic embargo on that island nation, one of the most self-destructive states on earth today.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor legislation to provide Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] impact aid to the States of Louisiana and Mississippi as well as the Territories. The impact aid provided under this measure would enable the States to save substantial sums in the hard-fought battle to maintain their economies.  The proposed legislation is based on my efforts as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to establish an Outer Continental Shelf Management Council, comprised of federally appointed State and territorial officials with expertise in ocean, land, and energy policy issues, and consisting of 11 members appointed by the President. This is a high level panel of representatives who can review and make recommendations to the OCS leadership on how to best manage the resource, all of whom would be independent of the Interior Department.

So I think that all the arguments that have been made against that approach are simply not correct because we are going to leave the citizens of Iraq in a situation where they are left to their own resources and the American people should have the same rights as well as Iraqi citizens to speak for the people of that country. I think that would be a better and a more acceptable alternative than having these elected leaderships in place for the future of the United States of America and the Iraqi people.

I thank my colleague and the chairman for consideration of this amendment affecting privately insured mortgages that are not guaranteed by the Federal Government. As you know, the Federal Government provides the guarantee on housing provided under the Federal Housing Finance Agency [FHA] principal and servicing mortgage program. However, not all FHA-insured mortgages are guaranteed by FHA. Some are paid directly by the mortgage market rather than by the government. In fact, many loans for which FHA guarantees are paid directly by the mortgage market are not guaranteed at all. Private mortgages are an essential service to these consumers. A reasonable interpretation of this amendment provides that Federal guarantees are only available for such mortgages that are guaranteed by a publicly insured agency. This would provide that when a public agency guarantees a privately insured mortgage, that agency is not required to make any further payments

I think we have all had our opportunities and debate time in this body today and, indeed, any Senator who has been given the opportunity to debate this bill on the floor of the Senate in any form will be reminded by his or her comments that the United States Senate and the American people in general have been treated to a very good debate and that the Senate did pass the bill out of the Armed Services Committee with the support of four of the six Democratic Senators. It did have a time limit of 18 hours in which debate was open to all Senators and a time limit of 30 minutes in which

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my dismay over the continued mishandling of the Cuban military regime by the United States Congress and the Clinton administration. President Clinton has placed the entire Cuban military in a state of crisis. The administration has promised an end to military aid to the Cuban military and suggested that all trade with Cuba would be to normalize relations with the American Government. Mr. Speaker, he has even proposed a loosening of trade relations with that country. Yet the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hughes) is writing to the Committee on Rules to shut down this discussion because he says, ``Let me tell you why it is that we are in such a state of crisis'' that they are in now.  He says that ``There is concern in some quarters that negotiations would soon be over'' with respect to normalizing relations

First of all, we need to be clear that the amendment to the rule that we will be considering that would immediately reverse a State law that could make this practice a Federal crime and open the doors to more frivolous lawsuits is not on the level of what this body needs to do today to help protect Americans against frivolous lawsuits.

He was not a judge that was just doing his work in court. He was a man who was a lawyer as well as an actor.

It is also an insult to the employees who have been working for the President for the last 8 years who have been working here as foreign policy staff and who also have responsibilities here in the Senate and are on this administration payroll. I called the White House and asked them to investigate this personally. They have given some background information but not any names. There have been no direct indictments of these individuals.

Mr. Speaker, the minority believes that the means just don't justify the ends. We believe that this bill is too broad and too high in its scope to achieve what is expected of the whole. A majority of the House believes that this bill will fail in its current form because of the outlay of not only a long list of deficit targets which will not be met but on top of that the bill will take longer than the current Senate bill and be more difficult to move through Congress in this session of Congress. As a result, we cannot support the measure at this time.  As the other side points out this bill contains provisions in the interests of moving tax legislation that are not in the interest of middle America but in the interest of big business and corporations that can ill afford to wait long for a Congress that will extend the current tax break

These regulations are the result of Congress knowing how to regulate all of the gas stations across America.

I do stand corrected on that. But then there are other avenues. As I pointed out the Senator is absolutely correct, we want to have a comprehensive national inventory of agricultural products so we can have the very best supply on the market in a very time-sensitive way, so we can give consumers more choices when they go to the grocery store and go through the supermarket to buy something that they know they can take home with them, that they know they can take out of their homes and use for good food. That is really what we want to do in this bill. This has been the only time in the history of the United States where we have taken this step to have a national inventory of products so that we can make those very important decisions about where to buy food from where in the country to purchase the most cost effective way to

Let me just give you one example that was brought to my attention that the administration could have brought to our attention that this bill was a massive increase in taxes on the middle class and that the middle class would have to pay for that tax increase in some other way.  If the government had used the authority that was given to them under the Budget Control Act to increase taxes on the working families of this country and the middle class and to their families, these increases would have been paid for

Mr. Speaker, well, America has a serious problem with energy prices. If you just peruse my Web site for a few minutes, you can see that prices in our major cities are increasing almost 20 percent since January of this year, making it hard for many Americans to pay their rent or go to the supermarket without a great deal of fear that they will end up paying the full cost of everything they need for a year. Think about it for a few minutes. The real question today is if Big Oil can continue to get a free ride on the American people to the point where they can make billions from the price of oil, the environment of air and water and resources that we have here at the Federal level which they are free to pollute without any regulation and without any protection of human health or the environment of the country and then only when

While this increase has reduced the administration's request by a small amount over this period of time, it should be noted that this administration has been consistent in its efforts to improve funding for the government programs aimed at maintaining a high quality of our electronic information technology.  With the exception of one program which in the past year has been justified on the grounds that the research could not be completed and the funds were provided in support of a student government competition, NIST has been funding the

As the gentleman knows, we have had multiple instances of discrimination and wage discrimination and result in significant cost savings or significant delay in service for a company that should be awarded that competition because of their name or because of their location or because of their program or their reason for entering the competition at all.

It is consistent with a ten-percent increase for international security activities that the administration requested at the time of the reauthorization of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 as well as other budgets and policies of the Federal Government relating to international affairs and for other purposes.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate National Small Business Week and to highlight the many opportunities available to the businesses of the small business community.  These are the owners, managers, and employees of small businesses who manage all day and put in long hours for a successful day-to-day operation.  In the small business community across the country, small businesses have consistently gained in value over time, which has created a positive flow in investments from small businesses to capital to employees.  During the recent recession, those who had access to credit during the financial downturn found it difficult to buy loans or buy loans to buy equipment or equipment for small businesses. This economic uncertainty has had the most adverse impact on American workers and small businesses. At the same time, the small business community

I would add to that there is a continuing resolution coming to the floor on the 11th hour that has not been allowed to be debated because they did not allow any time for Members to address the 10-year financial plan that the Government will be put in a position to go to if we do not enact this continuing resolution in the next few days.

It would force American families and small businesses to pay more for prescription drugs and they would be forced to pay more for health care insurance. And it would make healthcare in America more expensive, all while enacting $4 trillion in tax breaks for the wealthy while making it harder for the middle class to obtain health care. This bill is the wrong choice for America, and Congress must not pass it.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and to continue working on bipartisan solutions to secure health care for all Americans.  Phrases such as ``shrinking the Federal Government'' do not sound so good when you stand up to make President Trump's budget worse. We should

We cannot maintain the status quo in the marketplace if we are to move our economy forward. We must improve consumer protection so that the credit reporting system will not be abused by unscrupulous credit agencies that provide false information or create perverse incentives to obtain credit in order to exploit American consumers. We must support consumer reporting and credit reporting agencies because we know too many consumers have been deceived and many of our citizens have had their credit records altered or even destroyed by unscrupulous credit reporting agencies.

It requires Federal agencies to file public notice of any sale of Government property not sooner than 5 years after the date on which the property is taken and is immediately put to private use. The bill also sets forth guidelines and requirements that when a private party makes such a sale to a government entity, the government entity must make available for inspection the property and all related documents in the Government entity's possession in the event that the Government entity determines that such property has become publicly available for

And I want to say that I think it is the most fundamental bill we have addressed in this Congress, and I am confident that we can pass it on this House floor next week and make it a law.  We have a system where the executive branch runs the Federal Government. The executive branch runs the entire Federal Government, including education. It runs the Federal Government, and we should be as proud as we can be of what the Founding Fathers did when they gave the separation of powers to the President and the Congress of the United States to conduct the duties of that power.

Let me tell you why this new plan is not going to be a big increase in the cost of health care for working Americans while we are at it.  Under the proposal that will come out of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and the Workforce this week, it will help all the working families in this country who are in the current situation because it allows those working people to take up to 15

If they cannot in a country be certain that a person is not involved with that particular group of people who is in any way involved in that particular crime or terrorism situation, then we have to deal with the whole question of what the motive could be that would lead to that crime or terrorism problem in the first place. We cannot get to that only by law enforcement. We have to also deal with the issue of terrorism itself in that case because that is when the Nation has to respond to this problem in a most intense way by many factors including the intelligence that the American intelligence community has on that problem that needs to be constantly reex

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the world is a dangerous place and the world is threatened by terrorism across the globe. But unfortunately, the dangerous ideas of violence and extremism that have brought terrorists here to this country and brought them to this country's borders have been unleashed upon the heart of our Nation and the entire world.  As all of my colleagues are aware, one of the most troubling things about recent years has been the death of Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the heart of our Nation's Capital and who later led al Qaeda in Pakistan and around the world for more than 15 years before his death in December 2011.  Osama bin Laden's mission was not to hunt down American or Israelis, but he wanted to terrorize the people of

Mr. Chairman, the gentleman who just spoke has expressed a certain degree of unhappiness with me. We just had a hearing in the subcommittee on this same issue. It was something I suggested last year, because we have made some improvements in the bill. The gentleman had a more extensive hearing on that bill last year than we did this year because of the sensitivity that this bill has for some of the things that the chairman has suggested he would like to have in this bill. So it was a good hearing last year in the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the fact that we had improved the bill by a considerable amount is in no way offset by the cuts in the manager's amendment and the requirement that the Secretary have to comply with the recent Supreme Court decision. This is a back-to-back cut in one part and the

Speculation has run into the hundreds of billions of dollars.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, just let me say at the outset that I rise today in support of H.R. 1722 which will provide a much needed increase in the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 per hour over the next 2 years.  The number of minimum wage earners is growing but the salaries of those workers are stagnant. We have to make investments to help these workers and those wages remain up to par. Since there is no increase in spending over the next 10 years, we have to make investments to keep wages up. If we do not increase the minimum wage, there is little incentive for those who do the minimum wage to get overtime pay.  As we all know, Mr. Speaker, the wage gap in America continues to persist

Spiral winds in the Gulf of Mexico hit the lower 48 with gusts as high as 100 miles per hour. The hurricane surge in the Gulf of Mexico has reached a level approaching one-third of the area that was damaged by Katrina. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.

I would hope that at least the level in the $50 million that FEMA put in the hurricane damage plan is to be higher than the standard that we currently have in the plan because in 2005 that amount of money was going to exceed the need to respond to the gulf coast disaster by $100 million a year in 2005 and 2006. But what does that mean in practical terms to the people of my district in Louisiana that would be in this $250 million dollar gap in need from FEMA to meet these needs over the next 5

So he is willing to tax and do anything he thinks is necessary to preserve the health and safety of the American people, even though we might not agree with him.

Thank you very much, Representative Sanchez. And you're absolutely right. These trade deals are a deal-breaker for the American people. The American people know it and we should pass it, because if we don't, those companies will be here in a foreign land on the backs of the American workers and the American people. So we have to pass it today so we can get the workers back to work and get those companies here and stay out of the United States of America.  Thank you.

Mr. President, when we looked back at the work of this Chamber at the end of the last session, America watched a Congress that was not only expected to address the challenges facing the country but to do so in a measured and deliberate way. We have not seen this Congress since the well-intentioned efforts of our former colleague from the other side of the Capitol in the waning days of the last Congress by others such as our new Secretary of State, Colin Powell, our new Secretary of the Treasury, Douglas Shulman, and our new Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. In the process of trying to address the challenges of this new world, we have seen our country continue to slide toward a recession. We have seen the economy suffer economic reversals, from a peak in the mid-1990s to the current recession

So I think this resolution we are considering today is one that he needs to be supportive of and at least should consider being supported as a resolution. So it is not that he has not considered it on this floor or that there are not other Members who may or may not support the resolution and that are not trying to support the resolution, but they have not been allowed to do so by the other body or the leadership of the other body who has failed to provide us the opportunity

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a proposal that has been offered on the Senate floor by Senator Stevens and myself that calls for the Administration to accept its guidance on water resources and receive congressional action to permit and modify that guidance on a Presidential initiative or State initiative that has been approved by the Federal Government, and that is part of the California legislation that would result from that legislation.  I would note that my amendment does not require the Department to take any action. It merely calls for the administration to accept the administration's guidelines that it would be appropriate for a State to go ahead and grant the Federal Government a permit to send drinking water and sewage water into the State through designated water districts if that is the recommended course of action under the California legislation. It has been approved by the Federal Government. It has had a successful demonstration

Mr. President, this amendment reinstates the farmer-owned reserve which is suspended for the 7 years from 2002 to 2004. This legislation will help farmers who have been promised they would not have to pay more taxes if they sell their farmland in order to get the money back through sale taxes and other State taxes. It is based on an amendment I offered to the 1996 farm bill which I hoped to be brought up and adopted on a voice vote and which the committee accepted in a voice vote on a matter of great importance to the future of this country.  In the last couple of years the legislation has faced real opposition by the agricultural community because it would impose on farms and farmers the additional tax burden that some of them would not have to pay had the Congress simply required that they sell their land to pay those taxes that are going to the Federal Government if

There have been times in the past when this has been done a few days in advance of a bill's consideration and when there have been positive results for the body and for the country.  The present exercise is different because the Senate has been subjected to an emergency supplemental on the national emergency list. A majority of this body has been shut out of the legislative process with regard to that supplemental and the consideration of the legislation we all learned was an emergency in the first place--the bill that funds the war in Iraq and in which we have all lost soldiers and which will probably not be completed in 12 days or 2 days or 3 days or 4 days.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the resolution submitted by my distinguished colleague from the State of New York to recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Nation of Israel. This year, as the long awaited issue of the plight of the Palestinians for their right to self-determination and the call for the Israeli disengagement from the West Bank and Gaza to be renewed in order to reunify the Arab countries and a peaceful future for the Palestinians is still not resolved, I rise to recognize the very serious situation of the people of Israel and the State of Israel in the world today.  There are many things that I am most proud about the State of Israel. For over seventy years I have been a big supporter of Israel as I know that there are no two better friends than those countries that will never cease to be friends

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. 1028, The Health Insurance Reform for All Act of 2003. The economic and public health problems faced by our Nation depend on sound health care access and quality. Health care is the gold standard of public health.  The insurance industry's subsidies to the health insurance industry can cost as much as 70 percent of the premium, leaving just 2 percent for health care quality. Health insurance companies are also prohibited from fully negotiating their behalf on behalf of their patients. This creates significant obstacles to ensuring our patients receive the quality health care that they deserve.  A recent report found that in Massachusetts, a woman who is treated for diabetes can expect to face $2,700 in unexpected health care costs in addition to the 8 percent annual growth in her premium. Of particular concern are disparities between the poor

The most important one for workers in this country is the 11th Amendment of our Constitution. Those who say you cannot trade with Mexico that is a lie. Trade and free markets are the key to economic growth in this country. There has been no free trade agreement in this world. What we have, more than other countries in the world, is free enterprise on a global basis. Without economic freedom, the economic system collapses because of the economy becoming truly self-sufficient, not dependent on foreign forces but domestically self-sufficient. I know that is a controversial subject, but let's stand up for what we believe in and let's do it for our families.  Another key subject

The bill does not contain the enhancements in this bill that President Trump promised the Border Patrol agents that they would. So I think we are getting a lot closer to a crisis of domestic terrorism at our southern border that has long and deserved attention and could be solved.

This process is in the very best interest of the American people, and it provides that the spending levels agreed to in the budget resolution would apply to these programs as well as every other program and priority in the budget resolution.

This amendment would be to save the taxpayers roughly $30.5 million by preventing the funding of these well-funded and elaborate projects in this bill for students who are already very well qualified for financial assistance but are not prepared for it in the first place because they were not prepared for it in the first place. For students who are not ready for it in the first place because they are well qualified for financial assistance but not ready to go to college because they were not ready to go to college because they have had enough trouble or have had enough high school work experience, but they decided they are too bad because they are not a profit making business to invest, but if they can save a few dollars more on the interest charges on the loans, that means a few dollars more can be saved in college costs and less time and perhaps a little more

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 821, the Social Security Prescription Drug Transparency Act. Our most pressing health crisis in America is the rising number of seniors, our long-term health care needs, with a rapidly increasing need for prescription drugs.  This bipartisan legislation will require the Food and Drug Administration to do a more accurate and more effective reporting of the number and type of prescription drugs sold in the United States.

The President said that he would increase jobs in the economy by adding jobs that are coming out of these agencies and offices that our businesses have been trying to hire. It would add jobs that would jump start our economy, but the jobs would come from these other agencies and offices that the economy is not as strong as we would like it to be because we are still struggling in this recession and in this economic downturn that we are in.

The bill is the most comprehensive reform legislation we have had in over 10 years, and it is the law of the land. It represents real progress.  The number of people without health insurance has declined and the cost of health insurance has increased dramatically. But while the cost of health insurance has increased significantly, insurance coverage and the availability of quality health care has not. There is no time in the entire health care system to meet this shortfall in quality and to reduce insurance rates and increase affordability.  We need to provide much needed Federal

Mr. President, From 1950 to 1953, the United States was in the midst of a major military construction program in Europe in which our Armed Forces were engaged in an important global military competition for the service of freedom and democracy to the European peoples. America's Nation stood as the shining example to Europe's first Industrial Revolution where people from all walks of life and all walks of conscience worked together to build up democratic states and peace in the heart of Europe.  Under the leadership of Senator Joseph Nye, a man whose conservative views on government leadership might have been compared to that of a proud historical antichoice, President Eisenhower launched the Development Program for the Atlantic Community in 1952.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of SSG Michael Elledge of Fort Smith, AR. On November 8, 2007, an unknown assailant attacked a soldier in a parking lot of the Fort Smith National Cemetery and killed him before taking his life in a dramatic and heroic manner. We honor the fallen soldier's memory and we wish him well as he returns to his home State of Arkansas.  Michael was born in Louisiana and later enlisted in the Army in 1994. After graduation from high school he began a long and distinguished career in the Army as an electronic warfare specialist in the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. Thereafter he served in the first company of the Combat Support Program in Southern Iraq where he was appointed as a logistics sergeant and as a staff sergeant.

It is only right that our employees who are employed in the civilian service or those in the military should be made aware that there are both opportunities and constraints as it relates to the increase in salary that will occur in this year's fiscal year that will also affect their pay and benefits. I would offer this amendment to add some good sense to that situation as we move forward to get this done so that we can make this Nation more competitive and ensure that our military

As my colleagues know, she lost her life to suicide this year, and the story of that is the most moving story I have heard all year because it so directly relates to the tragedy of losing her daughter in that way and to so many other children who do not live to tell the story of their mothers who have so tragically died because of an illness or an accident and find their parents overcome by the tragedy of that death.  There have been some significant elements in this debate that have prompted the Senator from Washington to come forward as to why the current law is not broken. I will try to put her statements in perspective.

Since this involves an education issue, and we on our side have been working with the Senator from New York on the issue of education reform, let me ask unanimous consent that we bring up Senator John Glenn of Ohio in just a few minutes with Senator Gregg. We are trying to get both of them in here so we can do this so they will have time and time again today to do some real work in this area. I ask that Senator Glenn be brought forward and that we send Senator Gregg off so he can give some testimony about what needs to be done in this area and what we have seen in the past and how he can help us in this area and so forth. I ask unanimous consent that they be the first two or three colleagues in order to offer the amendment.  The  mother and child

Apparently, the Chair believes that that is not the amendment that was being debated. That has been ruled out of order since it did not even be considered in the Committee on Rules before that time. So as the Chair knows, it is the subject of another amendment that will be debated and vote on before this bill is concluded. That is what we are trying to do. And the fact that the Senate may have been somewhat confused because there were some very simple but very direct terms in the amendment before the Chair could rule the debate over.  I do not suggest that the Senator from Mississippi, who apparently is a fair and unbiased person on this issue, did not know what the subject of the amendment was. The Senator is quite correct that we ought to look at the bill. It is almost eight months later. It may not be appropriate

Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to discuss the harassment of whales and other marine life in my congressional district and the alarming rise in the number of marine mammals being targeted by poachers in the Gulf of Mexico.  Sea turtle and marine mammal populations are once again in a state of crisis and may yet be at or near the 100-year high from the beginning of this decade. So far this year, we have documented 71 dead sea turtles in Maine alone. A number of other marine mammals, including marine turtles, sea turtles, sea lamprey, and sea otters have also been reported to have been killed. Sea lamprey, a marine mammal, have been down to about 80 percent of their normal habitat and the sea lamprey population has had a 50 percent decline since 1993. Sea lamprey continue to be the prime target

Mr. Speaker, what will it take? What will it take for this body to finally wake up and recognize that it has to do more for the people it is elected to serve than just pointing fingers and smoking the herb of demagoguery? We have to put the Republican Party and the American people on the same page in terms of how we are going to do our work for them in a real way.  After 12 years of the President's failed foreign policy and Republican leadership's disdain for compromise, it's time for us in this Congress to finally lay the agenda for the American people where it belongs, not on the backs of the middle class and not on the backs of children and not on the backs of senior citizens.  It's time for the Republican leadership to get real with the American people and to set out a common

Mr. President, I will support the Balance Budget Act of 1997 which takes us the first step toward balance of budget in our Nation's history by returning to constitutional authority of Congress in Federal budgeting and deficit reduction from an era when the rules of the game were more set in stone than they are today. It is a point in the right direction. It is not going to be easy and it is not going to be overnight and it is not going to be done in a few years. But if we continue to make the hard decisions necessary to keep this Nation on the road to economic growth and prosperity and to help restore fiscal discipline to this Nation, if we continue to make the hard choices to reform the very Government that has helped to create economic prosperity for so many years and which has put our Nation on the right track, we will

Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the Gingrich-Armey rule to kill the minimum wage. This rule will allow Washington bureaucrats to increase the wage even more in the next year than the House originally gave it. This radical increase would force American families to work over 70 hours a week without a week off.  The Republican majority has crafted this rule to defeat minimum wage increase. I do not think it is fair. I think that the Republican majority is wrong. What we have is a situation in which a majority of the American people, Mr. Speaker, want a good, stable American Government, and the Democrat majority is determined to destroy that Government. It is time for a change. It is time to restore the American dream. I cannot support this bill.  The Republican majority and the Democratic majority have crafted a bad bill.

That was not the issue that we were concerned about. It was whether our allies would be better off if we did not have a NATO ally at all. And we still want NATO and that relationship that we have now with our allies is not an encirclement of America. We have to remember that. But the military might of NATO today is equal to a full United States military if it was there today and could have

If that bill solved that one thing, if it just said to the average American we will provide for them insurance, but the most important thing we should do is have a bill that focuses on job creation and that focuses on economic growth and not just on talking about health care. Senator Boxer is correct. We are in a recession. It is high time we in this Congress start to act on the things that help the American people rather than on the things that help their financial markets and the stock market and all of the things that the Republican leadership and the Democrat leadership has been trying to do all these years and that is look at the long-term implications of the way the big financial markets have worked in the past and see if we can't stimulate the economy instead of just talking about health care.

This legislation has strong bipartisan support in the House and it has been approved by the Committee on International Relations. It also is important to note that my legislation addresses a significant need for our Nation to improve the humanitarian efforts of its partners in Iraq, Syria, and Colombia. I would like to take just a moment to commend Congressman Kevin Johnson and Congressmen Kinzinger and Beilenson for the leadership they have shown in making this bill a success, and commend my friend from Arizona for introducing this legislation.

They wanted to extend the tax benefit for this particular gift to Members of Congress to do the work that we have to do for our constituents, and they have offered to extend it to them only a week and to ask that Members of Congress not be able to take anything of value from their own personal accounts. That is as far as they are going to go, so that is going to make it even more difficult for those Members of Congress to be able to take out a good contribution from their own personal accounts and take a good contribution from their constituents because they are now going to be allowed to take a present to a Member of Congress or the President of the United States without permission of their constituents.
