Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was a candidate who would make the tough issue bill. He made the tough issue bill the President's top priority.  Candidate Clinton, who has brought an economic plan to the White House, has brought a national agenda to the Congress. He has had the courage to confront the American people on the issue of tax increases and welfare reform.  Candidate Clinton, who made the tough issue bill the President's top priority, has brought the issue of abortion to the forefront of the American people. Candidate Clinton has changed the subject of welfare reform to an issue that has a deep and lasting effect on women's lives.  Candidate Clinton, who is going to be the President of the United States, is changing the subject of welfare reform to abortion. He is going to

eliminate companies drug 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing to eliminate the Drug Companies' Lobbying Disclosure Act of 2003.  We have all heard the statistics. Last year alone, over $40 billion in illegal drugs were imported into the United States. In this time of increasing illegal drug use, it is critical that Congress make it harder for drug companies to get their products on the market. I think it is pretty obvious that we can and should address the illegal drug problem.  According to a recent report, there are over 4,000 generic drugs available in the United States, but only 15 of them are approved for use by the FDA. According to the Institute of Medicine, ``The FDA is unable to identify new generic drugs to market because the generic drug companies have not made a concerted effort to

Mr. Speaker, the Senate bill is a fair and reasonable compromise which will ensure that OPM will continue to perform its constitutional and statutory duties.

speaker support insist 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, how is it that even with the constant moral and financial support of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to support the anti-choice politicians of this country they insist that we cannot do anything about the actual health of the American people? It is a sad day for America when they are so desperately trying to pass their anti-choice agenda without the people's support.  Today the House will vote on a budget that will devastate the American people and put them back on the streets.  Mr. Speaker, why are the Republicans so determined to protect the abortion industry? The answer is simple. The Republicans are anti-women.  As Mr. Thompson pointed out, their campaign to protect the health of the American people includes using a one-size-fits-all government mandate on the health of every American woman,

So I think the commission was fairly sympathetic and, I think, informed that the Navy, the Marines, and the Coast Guard were willing to accept the Army's proposal. I think the Department of Defense felt they could have done a better job in that regard, and that is why they rejected the Army's proposal.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I would point out that the Medicare plan is being attacked on two fronts. One is the President's proposal, and that is an attack on Medicare and the health care system. And the second is the administration's proposal.  Let me quote from a quote that was just sent to us by the President. He said, ``The Democratic plan, the President's plan, would leave Medicare with a $2 trillion hole in its finances,

Mr. Chairman, under the bill, the President says we can reduce funds appropriated for a State program by the committee chairman's discretion, and the committee chairman decides that is appropriate. So the President would have discretion.  The other problem is the President, as he talks to us, would have discretion.  I do not want to say that the President has got no discretion. I do not know that he has had no discretion. But the President would have discretion. I do not think he has any discretion.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Speaker, again, the Markey amendment does nothing to improve the bill that the Members are offering today because the sponsors are not in favor of any changes to the bill and would like to keep companies from being able to keep doing business with them. The amendment simply strikes the language in the bill that prevents State and local governments from using their own funds to pay for abortions.  The Markey amendment will in fact make it more difficult for the FDA to do its job and to protect the health and safety of American women. The Markey amendment would strike from the bill a provision which allows the FDA to regulate the sale of surgical devices that could have a direct impact on the health and safety of American women. The FDA would be prevented from doing its job by denying the FDA the ability to regulate the sale

I also want to speak on behalf of the District of Columbia as a Representative from the District of Columbia. I am a little bit embarrassed that the majority of the Members of the House have been treated differently. I will admit that I am not a member of the majority, and I am not a Democrat, and I am not a Republican. I am a Representative. I am in the minority. I understand that the legislative process is an important one, but I do not think it is appropriate to treat Members of Congress differently from

Senator Gregg and I did, of course, do our best to address the many requests we have from both sides of the aisle that President Bill Clinton and the United Nations have been doing their job in countries all over the world for many years now. I hope the American people can understand that there are many things in this bill that the President of the United States has been doing for the last 3 years that has been so far outstanding.  I have always been interested in the challenges of the United Nations and the fact that the United States and the world have been forced to pay more than we are taking in from the U.N. contributions. The American taxpayers have to support about $1.3 billion a year in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and they are paying more than they are taking in from the U.N.

It is up over 10 percent in the last 3 months.  This is a shocking situation. It is not an accident. It is not something that was caused by the weather. The price of gas in Colorado has gone up because of the Government shutdown that has taken place over the last 3 months.  What we have to understand, Mr. President, is that the situation in the energy field is so bad, so bad that if the Congress of the United States were to shut down, if the President of the United States were to shut down, that we would have a double hit on the American

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, last July I introduced legislation to fund the Flood Insurance Program for fiscal year 1996 through the annual cap-and-trade system, a system of taxes and subsidies designed to drive up the cost of insurance and prevent the extension of current policies.  At the time, I said that my goal was to have this program fully funded by the end of the year. Unfortunately, I was not able to do that. This bill includes an increase of $10 million for this program from last year's level, which I think is very appropriate. The increase is offset by an elimination of a few additional tax credits.  We know that this bill will save consumers billions of dollars over the next 7 years. In addition, this bill will help us achieve a goal of providing comprehensive

There are only two answers to this: one, a better way to do business; or, two, more enforcement. The former is much more popular than the latter.  Last week, the IRS sent a letter to taxpayers asking them to contribute more to the agency's tax-filing fees. That is a start. I applaud the IRS for their efforts.

divert inaccurate states 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, later today, some of our colleagues plan to offer amendments to this bill to divert the money to States that have not been receiving it in the past and to claim that they are not irresponsible or misleading when they claim that inaccurate data in their own districts was due to a legislative initiative that they have in the past.  In reality, this money is being diverted to many States where the schools are in desperate need of it. States like Louisiana, Louisiana has a great need. We all know that. But the other States in the region are also being asked to give up a great deal of money. Some of those are States like Tennessee and Georgia.  We have a lot of folks in the State of Tennessee who are well educated. We need to be making sure that the money that is being given to them is well spent

limits loan farmers 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill that imposes meaningful farm payment limitations. Farmers are making significant payments to loan limits and debtors are holding up payments to farm debt.  In August, the Department of Agriculture, USDA, finalized regulations that will apply to all crop insurance companies, with the exception of insurance that is offered through the federal Treasury. This regulation was issued to farmers and lenders to help ease the financial burden of higher loan limits, including the elimination of some farm credit protection cards.  This regulation has the potential to help our farmers by reducing the payment lag that is currently plaguing many lenders and farmers. Unfortunately, the rules are too cumbersome to implement quickly, and some members of Congress, including my good friend from Nebraska, Senator Cornyn, have expressed concern that this regulation may not be timely or work as intended

It also includes a provision for funding FAA-related programs in the public and commercial sectors. These programs are vital to aviation in America, and they will be the primary focus of this bill. The FAA is the Nation's primary Federal agency charged with air traffic control, airspace, and air navigation. It is responsible for the safety and security

I think it is important to put the record straight. Mr. Weener's concerns have not changed. They have not changed since we last discussed this issue in the Judiciary Committee, and he has offered a few additional amendments that have been accepted by the committee and that were agreed to by the committee.

We have not had a balanced budget in 13 years, we have not been on a course to balance the budget, and we are running a $5 trillion debt. And yet the Bush administration is not going to do anything to bring us on a path to balance the budget.  We need to make a real effort, not just talk, not just talk about spending cuts, but act.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, we are obliged to be responsible stewards of our environment, both here and abroad in the year 2002. President Bush and Environment Secretary Bruce Babbitt have set out a solid and comprehensive environmental agenda that is designed to meet the challenge of the next century. They are doing this with good intentions and a willingness to sacrifice for the common good.  The President and Secretary have taken an important first step toward creating a cleaner environment. They have addressed a number of serious environmental concerns, and their plan has the potential to improve our environment and reduce pollution. I believe that this initiative is one step toward meeting the President's environmental goals and is a step toward strengthening the United States' environmental record.  The administration's environmental agenda is a landmark in the history of our country. It will put the Nation on a course toward cleaner air,

Mr. President, on the occasion of his upcoming inauguration for his second term in office, the President of the United States has once again been in Alaska to pay his last public address since taking office in January of 2001 after years of service to the people of the State of Alaska and our Nation as a global economic leader.  President Bush's return to Alaska is, once again, a testament to his commitment to the State and to the people of the State of Alaska. While his visits to Alaska are an ongoing tribute to the strong bonds of cooperation and cooperation between the people of Alaska and the people of the United States, the President's continued visits to the Alaskan coastline, and to the Alaskan Coast Guard Station, are also reflective of his commitment to making a positive impact on the people of Alaska and the entire Nation.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me this time. I rise in strong support of House Resolution 993 which measures Congress's concern over the current situation in Bosnia.  Mr. Speaker, Bosnia has been wracked by warring factions for more than 5 years. The most recent outbreak of hostilities in this troubled region is a consequence of the indiscriminate shelling of populated areas. As the latest flare-up shows, the situation in Bosnia is a dangerous, humanitarian disaster.  The military conflict in Bosnia is a clear example of the cruel, inhuman, and counterproductive policies of the Bosnian Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs have invaded one-third of the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The Bosnian Serbs have murdered tens of thousands of Bosnian Moslems, and they have forced tens of thousands of others

If the gentleman is going to use the term ``process,'' I think it is an absolutely false and irresponsible statement to call it that. If we look at the major provisions of this bill, the bill that we have before us today, the House-Senate conference report, it is a lot like the process of a House of Representatives, it is a process where Members are having to come to the floor to present amendments.

Mr. Speaker, before the Thanksgiving holiday, we came to an agreement on a framework to increase spending cuts in the coming year. That is the $85 billion increase that we had in the Thanksgiving budget increase last year and $40 billion increase in the budget increase last year for the year ahead. While that increase is $40 billion percent of the rate of inflation, we have had to cut the other $20 billion.  Now, as we debate the details of that agreement, I want to point out that a lot of this $40 billion reduction comes from the way we pay for these programs. We pay for it with a tax cut that does not have the strength that the one that we passed in the last session, that cuts back the Medicare system.  We are not cutting back on health care.

Clinton's budget will create more than 7 million new jobs and more than $2 trillion in economic growth.  It will also be the first balanced budget since 1974, a decade when the country was facing a record deficit and $3.7 trillion in national debt. In fact, the President's budget will balance the budget by the year 2002, and at the same time will cut taxes for 98 percent of the American people.  President Clinton's budget also will help put America back to work by reducing taxes on Americans and helping the middle class by allowing families to keep more of their own money.

I have been involved in this investigation since its beginning. I found the Republican staff to be guilty of numerous and blatant misconduct, and they should be held accountable for their egregious behavior.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 384, which would increase the Title I support for families in need of community service to help them realize their hope of a better life and their future.  I am pleased to join with my colleague from New York, Mr. Zeldin, in offering this amendment, which would increase the title I support for the Family Service Corps Program by $6 million. This program provides $20 million annually to help the first-time foster parents become the permanent support families they need to provide a safe, loving, and nurturing home for their children.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and make sure that this $6 million increase is matched by $4 million in funds to expand the Family Service Corps Program.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This is a real problem that needs our attention because of the experience of millions of children with disabilities in the public schools, in the public facilities, in the foster care system.  The needs of the disabled are particularly acute in rural areas where the need for this assistance is greatest. The greatest need is the one for the special needs of children with special needs in the public schools, in the foster care system, and in the public facilities. In many instances, a special needs child may need the services of special education teachers or special education counselors, but it is difficult to find them because of the many special needs children in the

This amendment would streamline and clarify the Agency's operations, and eliminate duplicative agencies and accountants.  The OMB has estimated that the Agency's fiscal year 1997 budget would be $15.4 billion, a 35 percent reduction from the fiscal year 1996 level. This is a reduction of $3.1 billion from last year's budget. The funding cut would also result in a significant reduction in agency overhead and overhead expenses.

Since its inception, the U.S.-China relationship has been a pillar of stability and security for the United States and for the Chinese people. It is vital that the United States continue to be a leader in this area. We cannot allow the Chinese Government to cheat on the world's most important technology.

Madam Speaker, it's been 144 days since the House passed the Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. House Republicans passed the bill with almost no input from the other body and have been using the device of a closed rule to ram through legislation that will put American veterans at risk.  This bill spends $10.6 billion on veterans health care. Yet it does nothing to provide veterans with the same level of services they deserve.  This bill spends $400 million on new military construction, yet we are not funding the bases we need for the men and women who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This bill spends $3.3 billion on the VA's medical center expansion, yet the VA still cannot find a site for the new medical center.

Let me just read from the statement that was issued by the General Accounting Office, and I would like to read it again. ``The Tax Code provides for a variety of tax advantages, such as deferral of the 10 percent rate on a capital gains tax return.

Mr. President, every year since 1986 Congress has passed a resolution celebrating March 25th as Free and Equal Day for Women in the Ottoman Empire. It is not only a day to celebrate the Greeks' freedom and independence from the Ottoman Empire but also to honor the many women who have risked their lives and sacrificed so much to bring about freedom for all.  In an era when women were often viewed as second-class citizens, freedom for women in the Ottoman Empire was a liberating force for women. As a result, the day is commemorated as the National Women's Day of Celebration, and women are able to recognize their role in history.  The United States has a long history of supporting women and educating women. The National Women's History Museum, which opened in 1974, serves as a celebration of women's history and a place where we

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my dismay over the continued mishandling of the American people by the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Goss], the chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the aid to Egypt bill.  There are many reasons to question the handling of the committee's bill. For starters, the bill was drafted in a way that is unprecedented for a bill of this magnitude.  No previous Congress has ever seen the committee bill considered by the full House and Senate in the same week. So how can this bill have been considered so hastily?  I can only assume that the administration had something to do with it. Why did the White House attempt to insert a gag rule in the bill that would have prevented the committee from even hearing the bill?  Why were Members of Congress denied the opportunity to amend

I think there is a very legitimate concern that we are at a time now where we are having a debate about tax fairness, about how much taxes are too much, and about what it is that we ought to do about it. The President has proposed a tax cut that is primarily geared to those who are earning $100,000 to $250,000 a year, or people making more than $250,000. And we have been told by the administration that the amount of taxes that they are going to propose to the middle class is too high.  Mr. Speaker, we should all be

If you just peruse the price of gas and see what big oil companies have to trade off, it is very hard to understand why they continue to add to the price of gas, or why they have increased the price of gasoline at a time when the price of oil is at an all-time low.  It is important for the American people to understand that what is going on in Washington is actually hurting the American people. What is going on in Washington is hurting American families and American businesses. And the price of gas is actually hurting American workers.  Now, in America, as I said earlier, people are working hard, putting their families through college, getting married, starting a family, and paying their bills.

Well, Rush Limbaugh is at it again. Unable to defend an indefensible war in Iraq, he views women as the problem and the general population as the solution. His argument that ``we can't even find out who is behind the 9/11 attacks'' is mind-boggling.  Mr. Limbaugh and the other anti-choice activists who supported this misguided war are the real victims. It is women like Rebecca, whose husband, William, is a U.S. Army veteran, who told the Washington Post: ``I want to tell you, I didn't go to the war to save babies. I went to the war to kill.''  The war in Iraq is just another example of the problem with Mr. Limbaugh's view of women. I am proud to stand with Rebecca and all other women like her in opposing this

The credit unions and other community credit unions have been an important component of our local economy for a number of years. In many ways, credit unions have been the face of the ``New Economy.'' Credit unions provide an important avenue for access to credit and a financial safety net for many Americans who are unable to obtain credit through traditional financial institutions.  The purpose of the Rockefeller amendment is to provide that credit unions that are chartered under a State law or State regulation will be eligible for the Federal funds that are available to the credit unions.

The current reporting requirements for Federal agencies and State agencies vary greatly from agency to agency.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I call attention to the bravery exhibited during the Civil War by Private John Bar reuben and the Delaware Pennsylvania National Guard.  On June 6, 1862, as General George Washington, a member of the Maryland Continental Army, attempted to march north from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lieutenant Colonel Bar had to jump into a ditch and free himself. A fierce struggle ensued and Lieutenant Colonel Bar was awarded the Silver Star for his courage.  The following day, General Washington advanced to Washington Square where he could find no Confederate troops. Lieutenant Colonel Bar assisted him and was severely wounded in the battle, but he refused to leave his post and continued his battle.  The story of Lieutenant Colonel Bar's bravery is recounted in the book ``Sergeant Bar'' by James Butler, published by the National Military Library. The book tells the story of Lieutenant

Mr. Speaker, as one who is most consistently opposed to war and violence, I join the Members of this body in condemning the last days of this last year in Iraq when we have been consistently opposed to this war in this last year since that last month last year when the last month ago President Bush declared his intentions to go to war in Iraq.  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you are absolutely correct. You are right. This war has gone on too long. It is not worth it. I have not seen any country in the world that does not support democracy and civil rights, and that is the great challenge we have.  We are spending billions of dollars and our troops are being asked to go in and try to take out a government. And we have the greatest moral responsibility in the world

Mr. President, few people have had as significant an impact on the scientific world over the past 50 years as have scientists who are both human and nonhuman alike who have led forward their research and have improved our businesses, our lives, and our society.  There is no doubt that Dr. John Coleman, a highly regarded professor at Yale University and a renowned expert on the most complex of environmental problems, is one of the most well-respected and most respected public servants in America. He has played a critical role in bringing scientific understanding to bear on a wide range of issues and has received the Nobel Prize for his contribution to that field. Dr. Coleman's work has also significantly improved the lives of millions of people.  The other side of the coin is Mr. Roy Barr, who is the President of the National Science Foundation.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue. I strongly support his amendment because we should act to cut the cost of prescription drugs. In the Medicare Part D program, drug prices have been skyrocketing. They have doubled in the last 10 years. This has been the result of a variety of factors. It is well known that Medicare Part D is a failure, that it has created a perverse incentive for pharmaceutical companies to outsource jobs to Mexico and China, and that it has created an opportunity for drug companies to keep more of their profit.  In addition, the program has become so skewed toward the high-income earners that most beneficiaries do not even have access to the drug benefit.  This has made it more difficult for low-income Americans to afford prescription drugs. These costs have reached levels

december signature republican 

Final sequence: 

Last December, the Speaker told us that the Republican signature jobs bill was going to create 2 million jobs in January 2009. March 19 was January 15 in December when Republican House leaders came to the House floor and announced that signature legislation would create no jobs in January 2009. This week, Speaker Gingrich has brought the House to a screeching halt and, by refusing to even read the House bill, has given us a total lack of confidence in the ability of his own leadership to work through the legislative process.  Why?  Because Republicans are threatening to shut down the Government. In addition to threatening to shut down the Government, they are threatening to shut down the entire House of Representatives, threatening to adjourn the House and force all of our House Democrats to leave the House.  Speaker Gingrich and the Republican leadership want to run this House of

Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know that I have introduced legislation to establish a student financial aid program that would provide deduction of the cost of attending college and a student president or vice president, if available, would receive a grant of a portion of the costs of tuition and fees.  Currently, the Department of Education, Education Finance and Related Agencies, Secretary of Education, and other educational agencies, like the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and Science, provide students with a discretionary grant that allows them to pay for tuition and fees at a school of their choice, if they choose to attend.  The new Federal student financial aid program would provide a student a choice of tuition and fees, and the student would receive a refund of the cost of attending the school. This would allow students to attend a school that they would

committee reform president 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I am most pleased to join with the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary to introduce legislation which will reform the President's prosecutorial discretion.  The current administration's approach to prosecuting drug traffickers is flawed. It is a recipe for government failure. The drug war has produced more people arrested for drug trafficking than the entire domestic narcotics trade combined.  At the same time, the administration's aggressive approach to enforcement of drug laws has encouraged violent crime. The problem with the current administration's approach is that it is likely to lead to more people being arrested for drug trafficking. In fact, over the last year, Federal drug enforcement officials arrested over 20,000 individuals for drug trafficking. This is nearly four times the amount of drug arrests that occurred between 1985 and 1987.  I believe that the administration's approach is

Section 3 of this legislation would allow for the assets of small businesses to be donated to charities in order to help small businesses. I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Glenn, Snowe, and Lieberman, for their work on this legislation.  Small businesses create nearly half of all new jobs in the United States, and are the backbone of our Nation's economy. They provide our businesses with income that is vital to keeping our Nation's economic engine running. Small businesses account for nearly 20 percent of all U.S. private sector employment. They also play a critical role in ensuring that our Nation's infrastructure, housing, education, and transportation

Madam President, I listened to my colleague from Texas. I come to the floor to speak in opposition to the Senate Finance Committee American Health Care Act of 2007 because I do not believe this health care reform legislation will work for the American people and the American health care system and affairs.  As the first health care bill to be written by the Senate's Republican majority in nearly three decades, this legislation has some significant flaws. First, it provides enormous new tax breaks for the wealthy while ignoring or at least failing to address the deficit problem that exists today. The Tax Code is so complex that it is impossible for a legislative body to calculate the tax breaks that are necessary to finance a particular policy. We are all familiar with the double taxation of dividends and capital gains. There is also the taxation of Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits. As a

film association protection

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 1997. This is a very good piece of legislation and it represents a very good association between the gun industry and the people of this country and the people of this world in which we live in the best film possible. I think it has a real effect on our country, and it has a real effect on the lives of people all over this country.  I think what it does is to say to the gun manufacturers and to the people who are using them, I don't think we are interested in a law enforcement-based approach, because I think we should not use the people's money for a program that is designed to make them stupid, and we should not use the people's money

There is a lesson to be learned from this past financial crisis. One of the key lessons was that a good deal of the financial industry's concern over this economic downturn came not from the underlying problem of high credit risk, but from the policies of the Federal Reserve.  For decades, the Federal Reserve has engaged in a practice of not allowing banks to lend to consumers. In effect

The powerful United States-India strategic partnership is one of the most important in the world today and has provided bin Laden and al Qaeda with one of the deadliest weapons in the modern era.  Since the United States entered into nuclear cooperation with India, India has responded to a growing threat posed by al Qaeda by installing new nuclear facilities in Pakistan. The Pakistan-India cooperation has also led to the development of a strong counterterrorism cooperation that has helped to root out and disrupt terrorism in India.  The United States-India strategic partnership is based on a common commitment to freedom and democracy. We have fought side by side in Afghanistan, Iraq, and in Kashmir, and we

Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs--and a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and as a member of the American Indian Act--to discuss this important issue. I have great respect for the Chairman and the subcommittee chairman. I know they have been leaders in Indian issues in this country.  I believe the Appropriations Committee should be concerned about this issue, and I believe the Subcommittee on Indian Affairs has a legitimate interest in this issue. However, the bill before us today--and I think the entire committee--was not crafted in the best interests of the Indian people.  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am very concerned about the impact of this legislation on the Native American programs and the Indian trust fund.  We have heard from many of my colleagues today who want to know what this bill

It says, ``Every man and woman should have the right to choose freely and equally.''  Now, if you look at the Constitution, the First Amendment, you would say that is a very simple thing.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3289, which provides supplemental appropriations for providing for the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the terrorism threat posed by the global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Our subcommittee's attention has been particularly focused on a series of items that relate to FEMA's operations and facilities in the District of Columbia. Specifically, the subcommittee's consideration of the following legislation will provide the agency with an additional $10 million
