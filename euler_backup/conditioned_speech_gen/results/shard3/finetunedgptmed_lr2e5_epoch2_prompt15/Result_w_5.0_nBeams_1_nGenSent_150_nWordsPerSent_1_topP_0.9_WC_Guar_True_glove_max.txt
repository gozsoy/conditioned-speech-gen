Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was honest when he campaigned for the White House and the election to prove he was not a money-he-meant candidate that got everyone else to vote for him. He will not say it, but that is the issue. He is an honest President Clinton and when he ran for the White House he made sure that the money he raised as Bill Clinton took office was taken out of the real estate and commercial real estate and from my district and put into the volunteer corps of this country in Iowa and around this country and all across America.  That is what he said, that he would put the money into the volunteer corps, whether it be Dornan's household or any other area, and he said, ``If the volunteers do not like what

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing today to extend the Commemorative Coin program that will benefit the people of North Dakota. The extension will allow North Dakota to continue the success of the special issue and eliminate the scarcity problems caused by the Federal Government entering our State into an annual 10-year bond program to buy Federal debt with new dollars that it issues into the State treasury each year on an as-required basis from companies that are subject to a cash balance requirement under the Federal-State-Local Drug Control Cooperation Treaty.  Currently, the capital available to North Dakota to deal with our Federal debt obligation is limited to 5 million dollars. In effect, this year's issue will allow the State to issue 20 million new dollars into the State's coffers each year. Since 1991, the State

Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, a leader on this bill for the time, and chairman for bringing this important piece of legislation before the House.  In considering this legislation we have heard some passionate, sincere debates about what is a good policy for the Federal Government, and the problem I have with it is that we have made the decision that the Federal Government should be able to do whatever it wants to do with its own money. The State and local governments may decide that they want to spend some dollars differently. But the Federal Government should not be able to dictate to them how to spend their own money.  In America today, the average State spends more money in the Federal system than the entire Federal budget, yet we are blessed with perhaps the most progressive State and local governments on the face

Mr. Roger Gibson is a highly-regarded lawyer and an admired educator from DeKalb County who has made a mark for himself in the West and State. Craig Gibson grew up in DeKalb County and graduated from DeKalb College in 1950. He attended the University of Maryland School of Law before practicing in the Federal Criminal Division of the U.S. Army. He then moved back to DeKalb County and served as county prosecutor, county judge, and county deputy commissioner from 1958-64. In 1985, Mr. Gibson became an Assistant State Attorney and the Deputy Attorney General.  In 1987, he was named the Director of the State's Office of Substance Abuse Prevention,

These actions carried out without the support of the Allied Forces, the U.S. Government, the surrounding military forces, or any of their sympathizers was a major victory in the war against Nazi Germany.

But they have not denied citizenship or legalized illegality or made a career out of the quagmire of legalized illegal immigration. They have determined that if they do not limit the ability of illegal aliens to become eligible to receive any type of tax-free status--they claim it will hurt the economy--they will just enact a bigger mandate and further the ridiculous policy which is contained in the Senate

This is not a complicated issue at all. The amendment would create the first title II settlement fund which would be available for a minimum of 90 days prior to an emergency declaration that would allow Congress to raise the threshold by which the new title I settlement fund would qualify for distribution to the child children. In doing so, it would clear the way for expansion of the development of title I as it relates to the establishment of a children's reserve fund and which would require congressional approval.

And that is the deal that we have here in this amendment, so sponsors know that this is not the most complicated part of the Iran agreement. They know that the sales of the planes are contingent on the information they get, so we can get this information in the first place so we know what we are dealing with before we consider

There are a number of things that we want to accomplish, as we think about this expectation, so if we could just give the majority leader and the leadership time so they can review that part of the bill that they want to pass, and those items can be done today, and that we would not create further delays or stir things up any further than we already are.

They agreed and added that to the preconference report that the Secretary would need to provide a very detailed plan about all of the work that had been put into this entire process.

Fulton County Sheriff Deputy Troy Chisum should be turning 40 years old, a month from now.  As most law enforcement officers would have you believe, Troy has served in law enforcement for 25 years. He has served Illinois and the Northwest in that time. In fact, he is the first deputy sheriff in the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office who was born and raised in Amanda County. In 2007, Troy retired from law enforcement and returned to town to attend high school in Hancock.  Over the last 20 years, Troy has worked over 6,000 hours with law enforcement agencies in 33 different counties. He has not only been dedicated to the

Now, let's talk about this Brazilian cotton, and let me tell you, if I were to ask Brazilians on the street to put their government budget out on the table and show me how they would balance that budget if they agreed to cut back on the trade deficit with China, they would say it would make no difference because China is a global power that has a $1 bill a day trade surplus with the United States of America. Brazil has $2 billion in a trade deficit with the United States of America since the year 2000 with China between their farmers that the dispute is now between the poorest, most vulnerable people on Earth on one hand and the richest man on Earth, I guess, the United States of America, who has the largest trade deficit of any country in the world.

This legislation would allow a stronger role for the states and would prevent any States that want to impose sanctions on those people in those States who are receiving taxpayer assistance in the exchanges to do so. This would help those people in the States and help those people in the States that are complying with this law be crimes of opportunity for those insurance companies. This is a cost-saving measure that has been debated by this House for years and years.  I encourage all my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk about the fact that we can do the right thing by the American people. That is why I came to the floor this morning to speak about the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That is what this legislation does to help keep consumers price-competitive while ensuring that we are not allowing any of the subsidies for oil companies to go to the State of California.  I agree with my colleagues that every ounce of the American taxpayers' hard-earned money should not be spent on production of more oil. It is that simple. The legislation before us tonight also recognizes that we must develop alternative sources of energy, which we did in the Energy bill we passed this morning. It also recognizes the importance of developing new sources of energy--wind and solar energy and biopower.  So

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, last July the National Academy of Sciences issued a study which called into question the scientific data that the Bush administration presented in their annual report to Congress on Iraq. The report showed that the Bush administration and other intelligence agencies were not being truthful to the Congress over their war effort and over their policies in Iraq and the benefit to the taxpayer funds under the current law. I read a portion of the study and I think it is fair to call this their wake-up call on their flood of misinformation and misinformation and I would like to take this opportunity to review some of the basic findings of the report.  What is wrong with our intelligence community? It has always been characterized by its fidelity to the rule of law, its independence, and its integrity. I believe this year

But we are dealing with a circumstance in which the State that has the lowest taxes is the most strongly impacted, and I know that my colleague from Rhode Island would like to talk about some of the provisions in his proposal that would be of use to the States of New Jersey.

I certainly welcome the discussion and the fact that we can do better with the amount of education that we are providing, and I think as a Congress we need to recognize that we are making a significant contribution to a large amount of the problem that is confronting this country.

It is counterproductive to sending the wrong messages to our outdated industrial base and inaccurate incentives to our foreign competitors that are putting downward pressure on wages in this country.  It is equally wrong, Mr. Chairman, to ensure the maximum participation of American workers, especially those from lower-wage countries that don't enjoy the same level of living and job opportunities as those who move to the United States.

conference subcommittee agency 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the bi-partisan amendment sponsored by my good friend from Washington State, the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Committee on Appropriations. The bipartisan amendment was adopted as part of the Water Resources conference report reported by the subcommittee on November 5. The increase in the Agency's operating budget for fiscal year 1996 from $23 million to $36.2 million would allow the program to maintain current levels of recreational and compliance activities with the ecological laws of our Nation while fulfilling the costs of recent changes in statute and policy.  The amendment does three things:  First, it would ensure that this bill does not constitute an unfunded mandate to improve and maintain the habitat of the federally listed endangered species, as the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and I have argued is the case. This would

There are still days in the year when we are working on this bill. This week has been the week that we have been working on this bill most of the year now that it came to executive session. So we have been doing some very tough things. Last week was about 1 week of that work for the Senate this week to do some comments on the version of the bill that we had written up last year.  So we have certainly come a long way on that bill.  I would say to the Senator, my staff has indicated this morning that in fact there is the language on the desk right now, if I understand it, that

I had the opportunity to see the State come together to raise money for the Mid-Arkansas Healthy Kids program to help with the efforts to make it better for our kids to come back healthy and well so we can feel great.  Now there are kids across America who are suffering because of medical disabilities. One of the reasons the program is so effective is because of the work of Mid-Arkansas Medical Director Dr. Terry Waites. He is the University of Arkansas' pediatrician who has spent his career researching the causes and treatments of juvenile diabetes. During his tenure, he has compiled a huge body of data proving that in fact children are being diagnosed and treated appropriately for diabetes

When they get out of the program they are going to have a different experience because we now have a welfare program that has almost gone through the back years of States like Ohio and others that we know. It has been up and down ever since then.  I tried to ask the committee a question a few minutes ago. Has that really had a ``come-and-go'' effect? When is welfare in reform? What have you seen?

It seems to me that this issue is of major import because Customs is involved. There are no regulations or any controls on the flow of natural gas through the borders of this country.

It is a very logical characterization because they have put the same kind of funding at the core of their environmental initiatives in the past and the same kind of rhetoric as they are now using in the empty buildings and coal mines around America where we have done our environmental protection, and they keep using the same old tactics and the same old rhetoric because that is what they have done over the last half century.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, before the Thanksgiving holiday, we came to an agreement on a framework to stabilize Iraq and save the lives of our wounded in Iraq and other troops who come home from the fighting in Iraq and around the world. Many of us come from minority points of view in terms of budget cuts for deficit reduction which were of more interest to us than the spending cuts of the majority in this House and the majority in the other majority in the other Congress because we share a percent of the Nation's Tax Code but we are not really living within our means in our own backyard. We find that many Americans have Thanksgiving in our district and we have people watching on C-SPAN who understand that when we have a challenge of an issue, we ought to cut the deficit, not by $1 billion or $2 billion or $3 billion,

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4028, the ``Gas Line Gas Program Extension Act.'' As the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the bill before us today is an important bill to many of my colleagues and the many important projects and policies in California's so-called gas limit policy to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by America's oil and gas industry. In addition to yielding major benefits to Californians and State taxpayers through reduced prices for gasoline and increased efficiency, the gas provision is an important environmental policy--and an essential one at that.  In California, the California Gasoline Program's Gas Line extension is one of the most common elements in the State's general purpose economic plan. California's gas program was established

In an institution of democracy, the citizenry must be prepared to protect and defend its rights, from its museums to its courts and militia. But in this Nation, none of us should be above the law. To a lot of people, that notion was unimaginable a few decades ago. So when this Government shut down--making this executive branch an institution of law-making and, in effect, a virtual free-for-all--it did more than call to mind the values that have made our Nation what it is today.

Mr. Speaker, more than 37 million people in the United States have a disability, including an estimated 16 million who are in nursing home care and more than 8 million seniors and disabled Americans with disabilities who have experience or current substance abuse. These Americans require more treatment and are willing to pay a high price. Instead of allowing those without a voice to get the help they deserve and deserve with the dignity that we deserve, the Drug Enforcement Agency and Federal Prison Industries [FPI] use taxpayer dollars to subsidize inhumane, abusive, and ineffective treatment to Americans who deserve it. This outrageous public policy should stop.  As we stand today, DEA and FPI are treating more than half a million Americans a year for drug abuse and working to give those who have not been able to enter treatment a pathway towards a workable rehabilitation plan.

It was funded at the national level, a fiscal committee amendment that would have been subject to the accountability provisions of the House rules and accountability measure that we adopted in 1994. That accountability measure required the organizations to report to the Ethics Committee how they spend Federal funds that support abortion in this country and transparency in how this funding is used.  I would submit that this organization, which has become known in some quarters as ``the Baby-Sitters Club'' in recent years, does little to advance the cause of women's health and the right to choose.  It is nothing new to understand that pro-choice Americans have more deeply held views than do many on

Today, the House will vote on a bill that is all of the Republican Congressmen's proposals for the next year for building a more secure defense for our country. The President has repeatedly called for $4 trillion in defense cuts in this next year alone without giving the House a chance to offer any proposal for any of that decision to appeal to the American people. While the President does not call for all the cuts that he says he wants to request but wants denied, the simple fact is the President still wants to cut the defense budget by as much as a third over the next 5 years.  The majority's budget rejects the President's proposal. And it proposes to cut the military

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, as we draw to a close today this debate on the balanced budget amendment, it is very important to have a statement from our colleague and friend and his well- affairs. That is a discussion we will have all day on the House floor on Monday to bring to our colleagues' attention these same issues because it is our understanding we will be here on the House floor that same quality of argument, very well articulated arguments by both of the speakers.  I have to commend my colleague, the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], who has put on great dignity to the House and to the Nation today, and he will have a rich life in these hallowed halls of Congress. We certainly owe him a debt of gratitude for this outstanding performance.  Mr.

Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Spence and the National Security Committee for accepting my amendment on border security and the need to protect our most critical defense interests. Border security has long been a central part of our government's foreign policy and it is critical that our government have the support of the private sector to secure our border and our ports and our land borders that provide our Nation with its economy, its social contract and its national interests. Not only does the private sector preference in securing our borders and our ports and our land borders, but we are doing a more than adequate job. We have better than adequate border security, and border security is more important than ever.  Border security is not just a border security question; it is also a security issue, one that touches on America's security and defense in multiple areas of our social contract and

His distinguished career included service in Vietnam and Desert Storm. His honors included the Medal of Honor for his courageous service in the Korea War and the highest military award a Member of this body can receive, the Purple Heart.  There is no question the bravery of his countrymen has never been questioned by the people of the United States of America. We have served with them in conflicts spanning over a century of conflict, Desert Sahara to the present.  When faced with the need for action in the Vietnam war, Congress forced President Johnson to be our Commander in Chief and make the decision to go into Vietnam. Unfortunately for all of us, that decision failed and we are back to Vietnam.  Although there were battles fought in the

Mr. Speaker, over a million Americans, including 200,000 young Americans, are living with type 1 diabetes and the complications that it causes. Some of those new individuals are able to move their glucose levels to the normal range using other aids that have similar levels of insulin in them such as insulin pens, which are used by hospitals and other health care facilities such as research labs. In these kinds of settings the use of these devices to treat diabetes can often lead to multiple diabetic episodes, including those with type 1 diabetes.  I am here today to urge Members on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 4545, the Basic Science Research and Development Act. It will make these new advances possible by creating a new dedicated National Institutes of Health grant program to address new breakthroughs in the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

Mr. President, today I am proud to stand here with Senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee, and Marco Rubio to introduce the Federal Control of Our Health Act of 2011. The Federal Government should not be creating a new entitlement program for our Nation's growing population of adults with disabilities. This law will ensure that States and local governments do not create any new responsibilities for adults with disabilities while maintaining the protections for Americans with disabilities themselves.  Twenty-two States, with the support of 75 Governors, have already enacted Medicaid requirements prohibiting adults with disabilities from adult correctional facilities. Adult juveniles, in particular, are receiving separate treatment for their disabilities from adult corrections officers. The Federal Government has a responsibility to ensure that our children do not have to endure this violation of their rights, and this commonsense approach to extending Medicaid coverage to adults with disabilities is the only remedy

One of the amendments that is rejected will be offered under the suspension of rules which would permit debate on both sides for a minimum of 30 hours on both sides of this issue. That would allow everyone to offer amendments to accept the amendment if they wish, and this would then be laid aside so that we could consider either amendment tomorrow morning to conclude the discussion. That is the reason for the schedule, and I want all Senators to have this opportunity to take a look at it and see if it is acceptable to them.

Tribal courts can be particularly useful when helping develop and administer tribal government, including enforcement of U.S. and State laws relating to the use of trust funds.  It has become increasingly apparent to me that Tribal courts are most effective when the Federal government gets in the middle and hands over the spoils and remedies in this time of crisis. By doing so, tribal courts are able to bridge the gap between justice and the lands of the United States of America.  For years, Mr. President, many of my colleagues have objected to tribal court proceedings that are reported only in the Indian Country section of the newspapers, because they lack broad jurisdiction,

We have established a hazardous disorders program within the budget for utilization of our highway machinery, metabolic research, superconducting magnets, transportation equipment, safety equipment, and now that is acceptable to all OSHA concerns.

Senator Kennedy had the distinguished justice of the Supreme Court as a close friend.

I thank my colleague and the chairman for consideration of this amendment affecting privately insured part of Medicare and that this amendment is consistent with House Resolution 1155.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would reduce the amount of Medicare reimbursement rate to eligible individuals from the current rate of 24 percent to a reasonable, market-based rate that allows the eligibility of both employers and individuals for Medicare benefits. This means that this amendment allows all eligible individuals eligible for Medicare access to health care, regardless of whether they have employer notification plans or if they are self-employed, or who work for one of the 13 plans in the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), or an advisory panel that reviews the eligibility for Medicare and determines if Medicare payments should be made to that plan, as well as work insurance and certain private health coverage, to make sure that

Haiti still has no free and independent media and its government has been unable to aid in the apprehension of those who wish to destroy it.  Under Democrat rule, both Congress and the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Linder] turned a blind eye to the potential criminal activity in Haiti, despite the terrible nature of the failure of the Haitian Government and the Bush Administration to protect the United States citizens.  The courageous efforts of Speaker Gingrich and minority party chairwoman, Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, to change this attitude could not be more appropriate. Rather than make an exception

There is no way of increasing the unemployment insurance coverage under this legislation but at least by one hundred thousand more workers and by that limited amount of workers who are likely to be Arkansas farmers will be made eligible for this amount of funding.

But I want to make clear for the Record that I support a permanent Secretary of Agriculture which would be in charge of managing these plans and Congress would act before any temporary liquidation occurs.  In the absence of such action, S. 2197, the National Milk Producers Act of 1996, which I have introduced with Senator Craig, would place a federal government management authority, FAIR, on S. 2197 and Congress would determine at which point in the future this authority would be exercised.

My amendment simply requires that the block grant be used for what is needed to address the greatest needs of local governments, schools, homeowners and families.  My amendment provides a 5-year growth plan for the block grant to the States and local governments. The amendment is consistent with the direction that the Republican majority has decided to take on education, the challenge to fund the other programs, which of course includes education, in order to ensure that we have an adequate funding level for our youth and then for this whole

In the previous amendment, we discussed title II, the Gasoline Regulations Act, which creates a gas market program in which States could require a gasoline tax, which is the same fee that would be required on State sales taxes and other taxes that are imposed on the consumer in most areas of the country to help finance potential regulations.  Under that amendment, a State could then make a voluntary change in its gas tax rate, and then, under title II, the MMS should provide that amount of tax relief to the consumer for a 6-year period.  By encouraging compliance with the current law, the amendment does not eliminate existing taxes; it simply establishes a greater incentive to install and maintain energy efficient infrastructure.

A few weeks ago, as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I chaired a hearing on the issue of Chinese state-owned banks and loans that the bank will now reserve for American firms, and they are taking American jobs that we build our factories and we get products from, to China. They need the money now so they can fund a major Beijing construction project that will take over 200,000 construction jobs out of the United States.  So the answer to the question posed earlier by the gentleman from California [Mr. Dreier] is simply to say we cannot support the Pelosi plan, which

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, last week the Senate took a few moments to pass a resolution honoring an exemplary member of the Senate staff who recently passed away. Dr. Howard Cook was the assistant Democratic leader and legislative director of the Senate Finance Committee for Congresswoman Louise Slaughter, who has served since 1982. Since leaving Congress in 1989, she served with distinction for 21 years on several career and ministerial committees of the Senate. Her work is well known and is, unfortunately, known to many.  Upon her retirement from the Senate in 1994, Congresswoman Slaughter was only the third woman to be elected to both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Howard Cook was her mentor and leader. He was a talented, hard-working man whose enthusiasm for working to address important congressional and policy issues proved genuine in spite of his voice.

So this is not surprising to me and the American public when we look at it and see that the comments of my good friend, the chairman, and the ranking member, and my good friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson), and the chairman, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), and so many others, are absolutely right on target.

They do not want the national health plan of what we will have here in 5 years to be a plan that will cover all Americans in this country on a pay-go basis without any plans that we can live with for the next 10, 15, 20 years.

This bill deals with the implementation of the Foreign Farm Workforce Loan Program. It seeks to improve its effectiveness by reducing the cost to the Treasury by shifting to a cost-share basis the total payments to the Treasury. Further reducing the Treasury yield loss is intended to minimize the harsh effect on the Federal Treasury because we are attempting to increase farm wages.

Mr. President, on a completely different matter, the Senate is resuming our work this afternoon. The Senate has voted to adopt a new farm bill that will do more than create an adequate reserve fund to pay interest on Federal food and agricultural programs. It will also strengthen and reauthorize the National Agricultural Technology Assistance Program for our country's farmers and ranchers and make critical changes to regulatory and enforcement laws and to trade policies that impact our Nation's agriculture and ranching industry. President Clinton's decision to veto the farm bill was especially disappointing, and it is because he made a choice which has already impacted American farm and ranching communities and agriculture in general.  This past week, I toured a Nebraska farm, located in the amazing area known as the Great Plains, to listen to the many people who work there who have worked for this country and

It would streamline real property maintenance spending and allow us to use safer and less burdensome processes to process claims that have been well-documented and have been authorized by the Department of Defense and the Federal courts.

If the Senator will yield further, we do not want to give up time that we already have allocated to the amendment by granting a quorum call at this time, so I am constrained not to object.  The  homelessness provision simply simply gives the agencies the discretion to report the percentage of homelessness they consider necessary.  It is my understanding that the purpose of section 502, as I understand it, is to provide options for housing reserved for veterans and their families with dependent children.  In effect, this section is simply to give the agencies more latitude than before, but it is true that those reports that are received will become part of the database, will be added to the homeless programs, will be added to the homelessness services and will be collected to assist States

In just 3 short years, George has served as Texas postmaster general and commander of Texas State College in Fort Bend County and Tennessee State College in Greenville County. His foresight and leadership is truly commendable. He even took the initiative in hiring three people to aid the post office to perform the duties of their new postmaster, working with Frank Graves, George's brother and then-advisor; and they will be working for him again.

The President says we should balance the budget and protect Social Security because it is so important to the future health of our country. Yet those are the same policies that have not only placed Social Security in peril, they have put families at risk. For those offenders who are retiring now and plan to retire in the next 30 to 40 years, there are at least 4 years before they get to age 66.

They want to have all of these years of a year year when there will be no budget in the month of February when we are in a state of full and clear default and the dollar will have gone down and you do not have any savings to put in to pay down interest costs or to pay down the interest rate yield. But what they have decided to do is take in $1 trillion in just cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, and to take in $1 trillion in just changes in the formulary for the 30-year prescription drug benefit for Medicare. That is $1 trillion in just cuts to

The purpose of the National Flood Insurance Program is to provide coverage for homeowners against their own personal losses resulting from the lack of normal flooding conditions, or individual damage losses due to an act or omission of a government official or agency.

Mr. President, I appreciate the comments the Senator from Iowa was making. I was not the person who first brought this to our attention, but we have some staff that bring it to our attention. Senator Byrd and I are going to join Senator Smith and Senator Kennedy in urging President Bush and Secretary Perry to bring this situation to their attention now and, if appropriate, offer them assistance and assistance with any form of sanctions that they may think appropriate. But as far as stopping ineffective programs, there is still not a pattern. I do not see them stopping it.  This year we did raise $150 million, according to the American Cancer Society, for cancer research. This year, the Clinton administration asked us for $2 billion, and in the Clinton-Bush administration $2 billion.  There has not been any pattern or operation or purpose

Madam Speaker, there is clearly a lot to cover there. Let's start with the big one. First of all it is not just about the economic growth of the economy and the national economy that this legislation will have and the freedom that it will bring to the American people in the next 7 years. When you start looking at the impact on the world economy, who knows but we will see that impact. Now, to look at the expansion of global markets for United States agricultural exports, I repeat, all of this is going to increase the price of American food and goods around the world.  Another very significant factor in a number of ways is the change in the workforce that is going to be created, particularly the participation in the system. We are going to have more working women and men in the workforce. We are going to have more

The bill is promoted as providing security, but the Border Patrol Association, the former Border Patrol general counsel, testified before the House Homeland Security Committee that ``the bill will not accomplish what it claims to accomplish.''  It provides for increased funding for the secure fence. I might say, the border is 300 miles wide. That means there are a lot of, at the very least, 20 million undocumented immigrants entering the United States every year.  It does not permit the deployment of a laser range to secure our borders and will not change the access point requirement for the international airport at the northern border.

I come to the floor to say a few words in support of the amendment by Senator Dodd that is the underlying proposal of this bill and of the American people.  This is really a question of fairness and equity. I think the question of fairness and equity is this: I asked the President whether he could finance this level of spending or that level of spending with the money that the Government of the United States should not be spending as the affairs of this country. He said no. That is a fair answer. But where is the equity in our country?  We cannot balance the budget on the backs of the American people. We have to balance the budget by bringing the Government's spending under control. We have a choice. We can take on the shame of having an administration that

The process is that we cut it up so that it could be dealt with separately because we are so far apart from the other package. But there is a fundamental problem here: We are discussing those spending limits next week. We will have to deal with them. The thing that is sort of a dark cloud over the time when we will have to deal with these spending limits is that they seem to be a very heavy arm that is going to grip us when it comes to taxes.

But the question that needs to be asked here is who made the determination that certain governmental agencies should not receive Federal funding?  As I understand it, this is, in effect, a declaration that there is a broad exemption under the law of that issue. The so-called REINS Act puts this authority on agencies to make the judgments that they should not. So the Congress would have to take that power away from the agencies and say: Well, we do not trust you to make these judgments. It says you can't make them unless you get an exemption.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to address what I call the tale of two Kings, one good and one bad. First of all, let me address how we got to the point that we are right now in this situation of Government takeover of the economy that we are in today when it comes to the rate increase that is coming from this Congress of the United States of America that will rise from 2.4 percent this year to 2.8 percent next year and to over 3.1 percent the year after that, as well as the words of the President of the United States that, ``The problem of the Federal Government's irresponsibility in overcharging the American taxpayers is a government problem.''  I say to my colleagues, Madam Speaker, that it is the problem of the bureaucrats at the Treasury Department in getting in the way

house legislation availability 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, last Congress I introduced the only health reform legislation that truly had bipartisan support from the House and Senate Democrats and Republicans. My legislation required Federal agencies to purchase the medical equipment and supplies necessary to provide coverage for our health care needs regardless of availability or cost. This legislation is a success. Our Nation's hospitals, physician, and other health care providers want this legislation. They want access to high-quality health care and to reduce the cost of their care.  H.R. 1210 represents an important step forward in making this change in Government. It is a vital first step for us to begin the process of overhauling our Nation's health care system. H.R. 1210 still falls short of the goal of single-payer. The legislation does not go far enough, and many congressional Democrats have reservations about

Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on the nomination of William Daley to be the next Secretary of Education. I would like to take just a few minutes to comment on my vote against the nomination in committee and on the floor today because I believe the reason I voted against it was because of the administration's Department of Education plan to abolish the first-ever ``special education'' school. I believe that the proposal will have the not only the wrong result but will not bring about the change that I would want to see if I asked for it in the first place.  Let me emphasize this point. The Department of Education has come up with a plan to eliminate all minority schools. At a time when we are working to rebuild public education for all children, particularly disadvantaged children, I cannot in good conscience support a Department of Education plan

But just as the Soviet Union was able to direct and control the resources of the nation and its people at the service of their own state, so we, the young NATO States, were able to create a modern military infrastructure.

I said earlier that this House was supposed to stand up and take on the irresponsible and negligent spending of the Federal Government.

Drug companies were also running massive lobbying drives to counter public health and economic regulations and other corporate tax and regulatory policies that would affect industries like the family farmers who grow and harvest our food supply. If the people of this country did not have a voice, they had little chance of standing up against Big Oil.

begun percent budget 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I will support the Balance Budget Act of 1997 which takes us the next step in reaching fiscal fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget for the next 4 years. Let me begin by commending the majority for bringing forward a balanced budget plan which increases revenues to $53 billion by reducing the rate of increase in the rate of growth of the Federal share of the costs of the programs begun under the previous administration. That increase in revenues to $53 billion is $45 billion below the President's 1993 rate of increase in income taxes from $20 billion to $25 billion percent of gross domestic product.  The President's plan has been proposed and the Joint Committee on Taxation has said that it should be enacted this year. The Balanced Budget Act begins to implement that act. Under that act, CBO estimates that the amount of revenue raised

wage increase american 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the Gingrich-Armey rule to kill the minimum wage. This rule is a step in the wrong direction for American workers and the wages of American workers. The minimum wage increase will be a wage cut. Under the rule, the House will vote to eliminate the Paycheck Protection Program that provides critical transitional assistance to hardworking women and men struggling to buy food, health care, and housing. The majority's attempt to kill the Paycheck Protection Program is an attack on working families across this Nation.  The Paycheck Protection Program provides both affordable insurance benefits for the working poor, whose monthly premiums are more than half of a middle class family's earnings, and a strong, dignified job guarantee to the hardworking American worker who needs it most.  As my colleagues and I have said on many occasions, the greatest threat

The Senator asked for my votes on these issues and voted Democratic Caucus, on procedural votes.

Final sequence: 

If that bill solved that one thing, if it just said to the average American family that if you want to pay your insurance bill today--and if you pay a little more now, of course, the Federal Government has not done any better job than that--the Federal Government has not given you a better deal than you were going to get when Senator McCain first wrote the Republican health care bill Democrat leaders wrote and we voted on. That is the problem. We are at a time where the American consumer has decided that the American Government is not doing a great job for the American consumer and the Journal does not cover that.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3289, which provides supplemental appropriations to ensure the continued operations of our Nation's military and civilian nuclear weapons systems in order to provide our men and women in uniform with the resources and authorities they need to accomplish their mission in support of our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must commit to the security of our Nation and our citizens as we confront threats that confront this Nation and the world today. Our military forces have not and will not be threats to terrorism, nor are they intended to be on a battlefield. Our military personnel do not carry automatic weapons and they operate from multiple command and control points in order to accomplish the missions they are trained to do. Our military forces are dedicated to our Nation's citizens and its goals and are capable of doing all that is asked of them in a day

This will be good news in Marianna, FL, where Pete Peterson would love to have been born, raised and introduced into that community that will be known as the only majority Republican home for the last 17 years.  As a leader in the conservation movement, a leader in the baseball farm league, as the author of several books, and someone who is always open to dialogue and to your advice on health care policy, I think this was a perfect vehicle.
