Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican health care bill because it would result in lower quality of care for those most in need and in a higher cost to our health care system and to our economy overall.  The Republican health care bill would take $100 billion away from family incomes below $75,000 and increase premiums for 12 million American families. This means $1,000 more per family per year for health care insurance that they would pay for alone, and $20,000 more per year for health insurance they would pay for with increases in their income that they will pay for with higher health care costs.  The Republican bill would

Mr. Speaker, the United States has been dependent on China for vital supplies of energy for decades. Our American industry is committed to building a new renewable-based economy that begins in the global marketplace with the opening of new markets for American products in China. However, we also have a responsibility to our country and to the world to make sure that China maintains the largest list of ports in the world.  Last year, I met with the vice-chairman of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the Prime Minister of China, who told me that China has one of the world's most stringent trading and export controls on all aspects of its economy

Madam Speaker, I would simply point out that in the Federal Employees Act of 1946, Executive order 5430 (SDG-59), the Department of Labor's DOL counsel created a process by which those who asked to retain their time in the union would be appointed by the DOL under the provisions of Executive order 5430, the Commission on Conciliation and Merger.  And while it is my intention in future legislative or administrative action to eliminate or defer union representation positions to in-house representation in the DOL, and while it is not my intention to have the Chief Counsel of the House of Representatives place others in an inferior position, in

I have had the opportunity to learn a great deal from my friend and colleague during her time in the Senate and would like to take this opportunity to salute her on her many years of dedication to public service and as a public servant.

Well, guess what. The people are getting very real good news on that front. Yesterday, a new payroll survey showed that the unemployment rate in Washington has now fallen to 5.8%, the lowest for that time in history. Just as startling, the fall came just 3 months after we saw more than one in five Americans who want to work but are out of work look for work every single day of the year.  Now,

Mr. President, the President proposed to extend the so-called Government Contractor Tax Credit to States with a population of less than 100,000 people and an estimated 3 million persons of working age. This proposal is a step in the right direction to make the Federal Government more competitive in the world economy. I join my colleagues in this effort and urge support of the bill in conference.  The President asked Congress to extend this tax credit in the early 1980's in response to the economic downturn that was sweeping the Nation. In the last 2 years alone, $1.5 billion in Federal funds have been spent to establish several demonstration projects in 39 States.

The United Nations has recognized that health is universal not only in its presence and in its value in health care delivery but in the fact that it can be a way of life in most societies around the world and for most women in the long run. In addition to this fact, the issue of access to quality health care is critical to women's economic security and the success of the Nation's health care

The Democrats do not care about the people in the United States of America. They care more about the profits of those companies and the benefits to them.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the chairman's proposal to restore Amtrak's fiscal year 1996 budget. For 8 years Amtrak has faced a heavy and persistent deficit. Amtrak recently achieved a budget surplus in fiscal year 1997 of $15 million. I think it is unfair to railroad employees and riders who are otherwise unemployed or underemployed to ask for the maintenance of a lot of transportation projects which have been agreed to under the agreement that was just reached this past year. This is a 3.4 percent reduction in the full year 1985 budget. I think it is a fiscally responsible step for Amtrak, and I would hope that it will

Secondly, this legislation is not the solution for our flawed welfare system.  Mr. Chairman, the U.S. Senate has acted on this legislation by a large bipartisan margin and I would hope that this body can follow suit and adopt the House bill.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. I would say to her that I know that we all agree that the President made a mistake with the budget plan and that he should address the problem, that it is going to be real hard for him to cover the costs.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, let me just make a few points. The amendment that I am offering today also provides for a much more balanced consideration of these important areas. First and foremost, this amendment provides a balance between these important security provisions that we are now putting in place to help prevent the massive loss of life that would occur if the potential damage to our national security from the President's provocative and risky military actions in the Persian Gulf or elsewhere was to be limited, and the additional cost that would be placed on the American economy that it would bear if our foreign policy was not the very strong one we have in this Nation today that we all so much enjoy in

But would he support legislation that would limit the amount that could be appropriated for oil and gas exploration on Federal lands that are within certain limits, a moratorium on further exploration within that same Federal land limit, and that legislation would be in the same package to limit the amount of money that could be appropriated for

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the epidemic of violence and crime that is plaguing our Nation. A year ago, this country elected a President who called for a strong and effective police force and called for a National Commission on Law Enforcement and the District of Columbia. The President has submitted his commission to Congress to investigate how the Federal Government is spending and how it is protecting our communities. And this week Senator Collins and I are submitting a resolution to ensure that our administration must receive adequate review of the Federal actions to prevent and respond to crime in our country.

We just came back from the Midwest where we had the worst unemployment that we have seen since the Great Depression in my memory because of this price increase in housing. We have just seen a 50 percent increase in the cost of energy in the last week alone. And we have the Clean Air Act in the bill that would address this problem when it comes up for a vote in the House in this Congress. So I think it is

The only way we are going to deal with the deficit issue in this country is to get people to work now so we can cut tax cuts and to get the economy moving in the right direction so we can have a tax reform that will spur job creation and prosperity. But what we can not do with tax reform is to actually start cutting taxes now because that would be to deal with deficit reduction. We can only deal with deficit reduction

What this does is it says that if you do not believe that the rules are a good way of doing it that this goes away and if we can come up with some idea as to what it might be that the people who live in these special-interest areas of the country do not think are going to be the best idea to put in place to actually solve these problems that they have been complaining about and

So the bill increases overall spending for health care for our senior citizens by about one-third of 1 percent.  Now that is a 20-percent cut in spending.

Mr. President, I appreciate the offer to speak on the amendment offered by the Senator from Georgia, and would just say this does not say that the public schools should be cut, only that we should not cut them to pay for the big tax cuts in the legislation we are about to vote on. What it says is this is not just about children or education. There are some for whom our children are not important as individuals but as a nation. But I want to make it perfectly clear that there are some very wealthy people who may or may not even have children who have the opportunity to choose to not have their children attend public schools or to pay more

Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to bring to the attention of the House some of the issues and some of the statistics that have been given over and over and over again here this year by the administration.  One is the low level of unemployment which we are facing now. We have over 250,000 people out of work as of this morning. And when you look at the Congressional Budget Office numbers, the last time Congress had a debate on a so-called jobs bill and they came up with a number and we said, hey, now we know that in this year this year we are going to be trying to get the economy moving again, they

Mr. Speaker, on November 8, 1946, Americans returned home to vote in the last general election of this century. Six years later we would see the dissolution of the first and only federal empire in the history of the world. But for all the losses Americans suffered in that important civil war, they came back to life as vital and productive members of the public and private sector--business men and women who not only created the basic infrastructure for that rebuilding but put those services back to work immediately upon election day.  Americans who served in World War II made huge investments in the rebuilding of our military, Navy, and air forces and critical infrastructure in our cities
