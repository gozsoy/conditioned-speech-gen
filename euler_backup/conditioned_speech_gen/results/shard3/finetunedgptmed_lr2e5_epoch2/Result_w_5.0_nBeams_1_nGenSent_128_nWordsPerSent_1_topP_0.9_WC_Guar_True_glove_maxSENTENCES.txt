Mr. Speaker, President Clinton spoke in a speech a little over a month ago on taxes and welfare reform. In that speech he indicated he was not against tax cuts. He was for tax cuts. He said he supported tax cuts. But he couldn't think of a specific proposal to accomplish it.  Well, now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to know what President Clinton thinks about spending reductions or any type of tax relief. In my district, we have had some significant budget reductions in the last 10 years. I believe those numbers are more than we are in order to pay for the spending reduction that we are about to pursue in this Congress

The November 1994 elections were a great occasion for the Congress to provide September 28 October 15 pay increase to the workers in the 26 largest industrial States in the Union. Following this session, the House of Representatives voted to raise the minimum wage for the first time since 1963. This increase should be signed into law as soon as possible to ensure that wage increases are not delayed. The pay increase will actually mean that at least 50,000 workers will receive a raise
