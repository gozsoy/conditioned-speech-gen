Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was a new Democrat throughout the campaign of 1992, because of his commitment to the working class, and because of his desire to achieve economic opportunity for every American.  On October 25 of that year, as he was campaigning in Salt Lake City, this candidate appeared at a gathering of businessmen at a retreat. It was not a Republican gathering, and it was not an example of Republican payback. It was not even a Republican businessman who turned up and tried to offer a proposal as an offer. Instead, candidate Clinton sought to offer a suggestion as an offer.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing with Senator Dorgan to eliminate the regulatory and financial burdens placed on small rural businesses. This is a commonsense bill that will help protect our rural communities from burdensome regulations that are inconsistent with the Federal Government's true goals of economic growth and job creation.  Currently, the State of Maine has more than 12,000 small businesses and more than 200 drug and medical device manufacturers located in our State, and under current law many of these businesses have to comply with more than 150 disparate, burdensome rules and regulations. For small businesses, this is an unending, unnecessary hurdle that hinders their ability to create jobs, grow their businesses and to provide much needed services to the people of Maine and the Nation.  In addition, as I pointed out, the costs of complying with this archaic and burdensome regulation has dropped dramatically. This is especially true for

While Veterans Day has traditionally come on the first Sunday in April, this year we celebrate the Nation's first day in the summer months as the nation will observe National V-E Day on Monday and Tuesday of this week to pay respect to our veterans who continue to fight for their country and their country's veterans have an amazing ability to provide support and care to our veterans.  Many who came to this country as children have fought to defend our country and in many cases, that support has extended to their families. At a time when many other veterans feel like they are in limbo in their care, the Veterans Choice Act is a testament to our veterans. The bill offers them a complete option to choose a private VA health care system in lieu of health care provided in another State.  I would like to congratulate our Senate colleagues

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

This bill would yield substantial benefits to the American taxpayer and to our space industry.

Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is on the verge of passing landmark legislation. It has had a long, tortuous path. The McCain-Kennedy bill was the legislation President Clinton wanted in 1990 and which he fought tooth and nail to get through conference. Senator Kennedy later became reluctant to support the resolution of ratification because he thought it would be too costly and would allow passage of other bills. Senator Kennedy had concerns about giving the President unfettered authority to negotiate health care. He understood fully the problems with the current health care system. Nonetheless, after years of effort by Senator Kennedy and others, we finally have achieved a critical legislative accomplishment.

Mr. President, I express my strong support for the amendment offered by Senators Murray and Kennedy to increase funds for the No Child Left Behind Act. This amendment is particularly important to States that have programs that receive Federal education dollars.  No Child Left Behind was developed in response to the needs of States which were experiencing severe budget constraints. No Child Left Behind was enacted as the result of an agreement between the Department of Education, the Secretary of Education, and the Governors of 50 States and the District of Columbia. With this agreement, States that have specific needs for help were promised that Federal funding would be forthcoming.  The No Child Left Behind Act is now more than 7 years old. Unfortunately, the No Child Left Behind Act is still the law of the land, and we are now faced with a reality where we cannot trust the President to follow through on his commitments to reform No Child Left Behind and allow the States to implement their own programs

Mr. Chair, the last amendment dealt with the actual sale of the planes. The Iran nuclear deal, the JCPOA, does provide that we should license the foreign sales of Iran's military aircraft that are now in place as of today to other countries of the world and allow them to get money from those countries to do the same thing. So we could actually buy more planes. And as you can tell, this amendment does not add anything to the licensing of those planes. It just gives countries that need to purchase more expensive ones a chance to do it with lend-lease in the future.  So the Iranian attack on Israel, on this particular aircraft, is not justifiable. These are the very weapons Iran has amassed over its 20-year history of basically wrongfully supporting terrorism against our country. And that is what makes our people so scared about these weapons being brought to their country. So this amendment does not provide any additional authority for the Secretary

I understand the pressures the committee is under this year and particularly that the Park Service's fiscal year 1998 construction budget included two extremely high priorities. Most importantly, budget managers in both Houses agreed that the future of the National Park Service very much depends upon funds for a new $15 million pay raise for the park employees with the cost of a new Air Force operations center for the U-2 program. However, we have been extremely concerned by the administrative delay. The Park Service managers have addressed this by resubmitting the amendment to the House.  In the bill that was reported by the Committee on the Budget on March 27, 1988, a $3 million pay raise for the management and officers of the National Park Service is included, but it is not offset to the budget resolution.

Last month we were proud to have more than 250 billion dollars added to the unemployment benefit checks which give workers who are able to keep their jobs for the time necessary to keep their families together and keeping their businesses relevant for the essential operations of their businesses.  If these provisions are extended, this bill will extend another 12 weeks of benefits for tens of thousands of long-term unemployed workers. These employees will now have their benefits kicked into motion, assuming they return to work. They will have to wait another 6 months for their benefits to kick in.

Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on an amendment offered by the senior Senator from California that affects the lawful authority of the U.S. Postal Service to issue only ``limited'' commemorative coins for President Clinton.  As the Senator from California has just explained, the Postal Service has allowed the President to use its limited use authorization to issue a limited number of Presidential Inaugural coins for use in 2006 only. This provision was in the statute that was passed in 1993. Law corpus scholars believe that the law allows this limited authorization because Congress is willing to concede that the limited number of coins for Presidential Inaugural use can be granted to the President in a manner that allows the Postal Service to fulfill its statutory responsibility, which is to keep in the mail only a limited number of coins and to present these in a way that ensures they do not deteriorate, fading or appear uncollectible.

That is one of the ideas that is in the underlying bill that is being modified by the Senate, but what we have as far as the surface of the money is $90 million for $50 million and that would be a disaster, in my opinion. It would put $100 million out of the national highway program, and frankly I do not think it is fair to the States or to the American people who are now paying more and more for the private transportation, or the

Mr. President, finally, as each session of Congress comes to a close, both leaders traditionally pay tribute to the retiring Members of their own parties. I think it is appropriate that we take a moment this afternoon to pay our respects to one of Congress's most distinguished leaders and Democratic Members in the House of Representatives, the Honorable Howard Baker of Massachusetts. As Maryland's senior Senator, and leader of the Democratic Study Group, which the Republican leader has created as a political propaganda tool to reflect the best of the Democrat Party, Howard Baker has been the leader the Democratic Party needs. He has come to represent Maryland's interests and values, and he has demonstrated his ability to garner bipartisan support for the things he cares most about.  The fact that I will probably not be here on the floor of the Senate for this week only illustrates how much Senator Baker has meant to the State of Maryland and, I suspect, to this Nation. The Senator has been

I think the gentleman has heard the very compelling concerns we have heard here on this floor from our constituents as it relates to unfunded mandates of Federal regulation and the problems that this particular provision presents for this committee and for this country. It has been very clear to the American people that we are overcharged in this country and underpaid by the Federal Government for regulations imposed on violations of the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other statutes that affect their health and safety and economic well-being.  I just think it is important to clear up the record a little bit as to what we are facing because the American people want the Federal Government to live within its means. They want the Federal Government to abide by its own laws, abide by the rule of law, abide by our own Constitution.

In the years following his retirement from active life, Clifford Brown lived a life of remarkable courage and fortitude. Throughout his life he dedicated his life to his church and community as well as to his musical endeavors. When he went off to work in the Florida docks in 1941, he set out on a voyage through the Wilmington Harbor. Clifford himself would say, with typical modesty, that he set out because he had ``a great deal to offer,'' and with that, he served his country admirably in World War II.

Since we in Congress have long been opposed to Iran having the military capabilities of a nation that threatens the United States with disastrous attacks on U.S. soil, it is extremely important that our sanctions regime is strong enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend a truly remarkable individual, Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, on his retirement after 36 years of service to our country and his family. I have known General Sullivan for many years and have always been inspired by his ability to command and manage his troops. His exceptional leadership qualities and ability to work closely with all ranks of his personnel have been recognized time and time again and are directly reflected in the Individual Awards Program.  In 1965, with his first duty assignment as Chief of the Operations and Logistics Division, General Sullivan helped develop the Army's Combat Logistics System and served as Operations Chief from 1961 to 1967. Under his command, soldiers were deployed successfully in combat.

This nonprofit educational and technical museum highlighting the petroleum industry in southwest Texas has become the home of one of the world's largest petroleum museums in the world. The petroleum museum has worked to strengthen the oil industry and preserve the history of this critical industry, building on the multiple industry benefits that the petroleum museum provides in the area surrounding its facility in the southeast Texas oil basin and its 100 miles of oil pipelines and storage tank farms.  The petroleum museum supplies consumers with gas pump and appliance information for a safe and economical time when driving to and from work. Its information and advice on best practices when purchasing fuels is so valuable that hundreds of thousands of oil industry members use this resource daily.

Mr. Speaker, the agreement we are voting on today extends the Medicare select demonstration program to all 50 States for a 7\1/2\-year period beginning in 2006 and ending in 2009. That is almost 7 years of guaranteed care for seniors that no other Republican-controlled program in this body has provided since its creation nearly 10 years ago.  Because of the cost savings this program offers over current and other Medicare Advantage plans and because we are sure it will be a winner in the years to come, this is the only health care program we are voting on today that results from negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over the past year.  Under the Republican plan, seniors who lose their Medicare Advantage status would have the choice of a choice of plans, any plan that will meet their needs. That is the choice and I am a firm believer in the power of choice in health care.  Yet I have serious concerns that this agreement encourages seniors to go back to the old

Senator Gregg and I did, of course, do our best to address the many requests we received. We have made some difficult choices. The bill now includes the Congressional Budget Office recommendation that the President's fiscal year 2006 budget request be deficit neutral for 4 fiscal years beginning in fiscal year 2006 and ending in fiscal year 2008. According to the CBO estimates of the debt limit increase in fiscal year 2006 under the budget resolution $70 billion.  For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates a projected deficit in fiscal year 2006 of $87 billion, with a further $20 billion in debt service on the debt during fiscal year 2008. Accordingly, the bill allows the President's fiscal year 2006 budget request to be deficit neutral during fiscal years 2007 and 2008.  The change made in the budget resolution means that the President's fiscal year 2006 budget request will not be in deficit as of June 29, 2008, and, thus, it will have all of the votes

Mr. Chairman, we have the most efficient system, the safest, most effective way for a Government that is the mother of all systems to help the people who need help, including the children.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I think we have the agreement. I think I did ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above-listed amendments, the Senate be in a period of morning business for 1 hour equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on Finance and in the morning hour for Senators to be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes on substitute amendments only. I would urge them to take that to the House side and to ask for agreement and I think that would be the only change that we would be talking about and that would not prevent the Senate from being back in session today under the President's veto veto pen.

I would simply say that I think this action is responsible, it is needed, it is the best we can do for our military and what they need in the time we have available to them for the conduct of themselves and to make sure they are doing everything we can do to keep them safe so they do not have to make the difficult choice that we do now simply to go into this box because of what we have already decided to do. That is why I support this bill today. Chairman Gordon has done a good job in trying to get our military this much ready and in a position to meet the needs that they had and the Kennedy-Kassebaum recommendations that have been made.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a tremendous Hoosier public servant, leader of the Indiana State Senate, David Long, who recently announced his retirement from public service after 38 years in the office of the Hoosier State Senate after a long and distinguished career here in the House of Representatives where David has been a leader and a champion on a variety of issues that have been significant for the Hoosier State and have been a great benefit to the people of the State of Indiana.

Madam Speaker, the IRS has a quota system. The IRS promotes workers who bully taxpayers. The IRS targets opponents. The IRS literally snoops through our mail, demanding records in order to prove that we are innocent. IRS is trying to keep black mail from the American people through political mail- bruce man rages at the IRS for making the word ``White'' white on mail.  The IRS agents in Greene County, Georgia, know that the IRS is not telling the truth about our tax bill. In Georgia, according to local law enforcement, James Cawley, a conservative activist, wrote an anti-taxpayer letter to former Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Dennis Montgomery. Cawley gave his letter to thousands of Americans before the Atlanta audit.  IRS agent Paul Matthew says that Government forces are sending innocent Americans to jail because of the IRS quota system.  IRS agents have proven their loyalty to the IRS and to their boss,

Many of our colleagues have been talking a great deal about this issue this week in a way that should be very important for everyone in the country to consider and fully pay attention to. The chairman and the ranking member should come to the Congress of the United States and talk about what their legislation would do to help millions of Americans across the country the most vulnerable people in America because the Nation as a whole is much better off today than it was 12 months ago.  My friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle tell us that all of the problems that we are facing are not that of the census.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill that imposes meaningful farm payment limitations. A gentleman from Arkansas is the principal landlord of a dairy farmer in the small town of Winchester, AR that also is a city of over 20,000 people. He has been on the receiving end of a recent visit from the country.  The current farm bill is unwieldy. It imposes a no-work rule for USDA payments. This, while industry is being self-sustaining. Now the dairy farmer, Dave Anderson, wants to take some steps to make this a little bit better.  The farmer's law project wants to provide the option for the USDA to modify the no-work rule for payments made by the owner-operator of a dairy operations if the producer wishes to keep the operation more than 12 months. This farmer-owned operation will have to reach the number of employees the full-time worker minimum wage is paid to

I appreciate my colleague's candor. Actually, the Dole amendment yesterday solved the problem. Johnston solves it even further. What apparently the Secretary of Agriculture does not realize is that this amendment does not change any service that the Government is providing and this is about providing for the benefit of future generations of American citizens. It may be a different kind of disaster assistance program for flood control than it is for emergency assistance for hurricane problems, but this is about a specific service for particular and specific problems that are being in need in the country today that the Department of Agriculture provides not just for the future but for now as well and needs analysis and ideas from the service so that it will best serve the service.  Now, Johnston would agree that this amendment does give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to design a demonstration project for the purpose of coordinating the types of activities and the types of incentives that would be provided to provide better service to the particular person or group of people

This bill provides grants for small business programs and provides for early step capital for the local community business organizations to take the lead and get off the ground on providing capital for the development of high technology and services in the communities in which they operate. This agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, does this at great expense to States and localities.  I would like to read a quote from the report of a council of mayors from my own State of Virginia: When American communities lost local, state, and local      governments, they lost their civil and economic      affairs.

Madam President, let me make a couple comments concerning that. First, Mr. Weener has been on the Executive Calendar since March 24. So this isn't a year that he is going to be out of here before we start March 31 because there are going to be nominations to come up in early March that have not been sent out to the nominees since March 25. So this is only the first 10 days of the executive calendar.  Secondly, it is in the past 2 weeks, as a matter of fact, that we have been looking at the nomination of Ann O'Leary, who has been nominated to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, since March 12. It would have taken some time to get the nominations all done if Ms. O'Leary had been confirmed. Now it is 2 weeks. So we are not really getting at this nominee from February 22 until March 3, when the Senate is going to recess.  In addition, I yield

This is a program that is run by the government as part of the effort to try to place all of these people out of the jobs they were in before they came here. I think it is also time for the same kind of comments that I heard on my own time, Mr. Chairman, that the taxpayers have a right to be very concerned with what we are going to do here, and to learn some lesson as to what this program does and how it should be operated to take care of their needs, and that is what I believe we are doing here.

Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting the Mid-Arkansas River Valley Abilities Workshop, better known as MARVA, in Russellville, AR, which was established in 1992 by volunteers from three regional organizations in Arkansas to provide up-to-date skills to Arkansans ages 12 and older and who need to learn to swim, run and tackle a river or lake.  The course teaches the skills and benefits of underwater safety and the high dardanelle content, which is used to learn how to swim in the water. Those who graduate from MARVA are good job candidates for major construction or maintenance jobs where skills are needed in the future. Ron Arkart, the head of MARVA, called the course a model for training on the important construction work required to maintain our infrastructure.

Congresswoman, I was on welfare for 3 years. I do not know what my children would have done without that safety net. Since Republicans propose to increase the number of people who would be working at 12 or 13 hours and children only to work no more than 16 hours a week, the less money they have to save for their families the more they must reduce their means completely to go to work.

Mr. Chairman, today we are considering a deceptively simple amendment that would give the President of the United States the authority to cancel Federal education benefits if the unemployment rate is above 6.1 percent, the unemployment rate is above 9 percent, or the unemployment rate is above 12 percent. This amendment applies only to any definition of a nonparticipant that is more than 6.1 percent. The amendment does not affect any type of regulation or administrative action that affects education benefits.  The bottom line is that the CBO determined that canceling federal education benefits is the safest way to gut these programs. Currently, students graduating from a public or private four-year college earn $13,500, a very good standard of living for many Americans, but that is not good enough. The students enrolled in the higher education system continue to lose hope.  The recession has

Madam Speaker, well, the Bush administration set yet another record yesterday. Congratulations to the Bush administration. We set the highest 1-month trade deficit in the history of the United States of America just 2 months ago this week. The trade deficit with the rest of the world is $16 billion a day, and the deficit with the United States is not being set down through any kind of deficit reduction.  What is really going on here is the Bush administration has decided it will do more with less, and we are going to move in the wrong direction. We are going to end up in a quagmire and, in fact, the President has told the British people that ``the United States is for sale.'' We are not going to sell the United States to the Japanese.  Well, this administration will be selling to the Europeans and the Japanese. As Secretary Rubin is quoted in a New York Times article yesterday, this administration has told them that we

Madam Speaker, our Nation was founded on certain principles: that government should be of, by, and for the people; that a system of three coequal branches of government should ensure the people's rights. Unfortunately, our Founders frequently failed to live up to these promises. One man, however, might have changed that.  His name was Thomas Jefferson. He recognized that without the power of a Federal Executive trumping that of a local legislature, the people could not govern, that the Constitution of the United States had been hijacked by an unaccountable bureaucracy that usurped the rightful role of the States, and that a common people have a right to make decisions that will affect their lives every day.  It was this right to exercise a more direct form of government known as the people's government that enabled the people of this Nation to come together for the peaceful transition of power from one generation to the next. The wisdom of these early decisions came to define the

Even in these times of fiscal restraint, it would not be the most effective government policy to delay action on legislation such as the legislation I am pleased to offer today. As I said earlier in the day when President Bush addressed the Nation and made an important address about climate change and global warming, we need a scientific and scientific-based approach to climate change. If we are serious about reducing greenhouse gases, the creation of coal mining operations in natural gas fields and mining fisheries for oil and gas, we cannot wait another generation.  I welcome all the comments Senator Grassley and I have received over the last few weeks about this issue. I can assure you, Senator Grassley and I are on the same wavelength on this issue. I look forward to working with him on it. The administration is making a major determination about the best way to proceed with these projects.

That is an innovative characterization. I think the metaphor it represents is an accurate one. There is not much evidence of any real catch here. Let me use a very practical example to help explain why this is the case. It is my understanding that this type of catch exists when the safety of the consumer is in question. A consumer's use of a vehicle is not appropriate as an instrument of a collective bargaining agreement that represents this type of exposure to risk. We may give protection to consumers by not requiring that these people actually carry their tail light on the vehicle that is being driven so that they can make accurate determinations as to whether or not it is a high risk situation.  A company may, however, require that their drivers be under the control of this type of supplier for the reason that the only way the person can know whether or not this vehicle is going to exceed the safety standards which this company and these suppliers do so very effectively

The bill includes several important revisions, including new language to require the Attorney General to seek all court orders to prevent illegal firearms transfers and other State and local laws related to criminal and other violations of the Brady Act and other laws including the Illegal Firearms Laws Improvement Act of 2004. The bill also strengthens State criminal background check laws for firearms sold and transferred by State and local law enforcement officers in Arizona and for other legal firearms transactions in Arizona and Arizona legal businesses. It amends the Interstate Commerce Commission to provide the Commission the authority to deny San Diego, California, gun dealer licenses if the license applicant fails to comply with State criminal background check law.

Mr. Speaker, before the Thanksgiving holiday, we came to an agreement on a framework to work toward a balanced budget. Within this framework, we agreed to keep spending cuts in budget authority consistent with an agreement to pay for tax cuts that the President announced in his State of the Union last week and even if we get no bill to the President's desk in the next several days and we do not keep the tax cuts in the agreement or if the President does not sign the bill that he announced we will have in the next several days and we do not get the tax cuts because we have environmental conditions, this agreement is going to save the Federal Government somewhere around $900 billion.

Mr. President, just a few hours ago, President Clinton delivered his 5-year balanced budget to the Congress. For the first time in a long while, Democrats in Congress decided the American people wanted Washington to be a little more frugal with taxpayer dollars and hard work and the commitment to priorities that Americans want more than ever before. Democrats in Congress have already passed tax reform that Democrats agree Republicans should not even consider as far as raising taxes. Republicans in Congress support that bill and plan to get that passed this week if Clinton does it this year.  Americans like that in their Federal Government. They want to see the changes and cut back on waste, and there is absolutely no reason the Congress cannot in fact take a look at tax reform and cut out the extra spending and flat-out get rid of these middle-class tax breaks that Americans want and do not want in their government--the same kind of proposals that Republicans will get passed in the other

It is an issue that we all share in common and that President Clinton has supported by signing into law a landmark health reform law with millions of Americans back to work today and which I supported as well. It is important to understand why this issue is so critical and why we must have health reform that truly works and which truly guarantees health care reform for all Americans and institutions that are not already covering it.  As we look at this proposal, it seems like it is taking too much away from those altogether who need health care the most--children. It eliminates the term limits, making Senators ineligible for the same office and forcing a running a candidate through a series of costly pre-election tests before we even allow them to serve.

Mr. President, as this unprecedented Government ``shutdown'' continues, I trust we will not fail to consider its impact in terms of how it affects so many Americans with regard to health care. With the passage of the emergency health care bill, the American people will be forced to endure new and ever increasing cost of health care for the United States Government and the Federal Government in national security, travel and recreation and labor and the transportation of goods in America will have to be increased substantially. I have said it before, but it bears repeating once more because the shutdown itself is increasing the overall cost of health care for American families and it is going to have an enormous and dramatic impact on the public in the years to come as the Government museum which we use as a laboratory for health care reform will have to be opened to make further improvements, because most of the employees of the Government will not have the resources to do so at their current rate of hiring.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I rise to offer my amendment to H.R. 384, which would strike the bill's misguided provisions that would water down America's housing reform law and make home ownership more expensive for families.  For years, home mortgages have been more affordable than loans secured by insurance. At the same time mortgage lenders have had the incentive to add provisions that lenders often despise--in addition to lenders discouraging borrowers from refinancing loans because homeowners are mortgage borrowers. Mortgage lenders continue to favor lenders who do mortgage servicing on their books.  The Nation's largest lenders have promoted loan-to-value mortgages. Back in the late 1980s, they realized that tenants living in Federal housing projects would make very little money renting a home, so they convinced the Department of Housing and Urban Development to create an incentive for them to accept rental payments as if they were a homeowner. Now we know that most prime contractors do not accept these payments as a condition

Mr. Speaker, more than 37 million people in the United States have a disability, including more than 500,000 in Minnesota. For parents raising a child with a disability, finding and getting a job is tough and difficult to do. In order to make it easier for families to get the education and skills they need to be successful in the American work force, States and States have created Living with a Disability Act to help States increase access to the public workforce and improve the number of people who are able to gain these public services from the States that have passed this States United Service Employees.  Unfortunately, legislation in the 107th Congress with the exception of H.R. 6162 passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. The conference committee report on this legislation was a big miss. It would have increased the minimum wage for people working in the public service by $2.50 over 1 year.

Thank you. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy and his continued focus on the opportunities we face with the energy legislation that is coming before us now in terms of energy policy in this country. The question that the American people need to ask us is who is driving the majority of power in Washington and the Washington influence in Washington? Well, the number one leadership on that side of the aisle has been the Republicans, and if we take it that way for the last Iraq war, since that war, have been the Republicans in both Houses of Congress.  The idea that the Republicans and the White House are the problem is one of the most outrageous assertions I have ever heard in my entire career here, and that is the idea that what we have seen on the floor in this House in the past 2 months are the result of a conspiracy, we would be glad to discuss.

Mr. President, I join with my colleagues today in strongly endorsing this bipartisan resolution, which represents an important step in the fight to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the United States and around the world.  Our resolution is a tribute to the United States and all those in its Armed Forces for their most recent efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan to stem the tide of terror and that which once threatened this country and its people. After the last decade has ended, the United States and its United Nations partners in the United Nations have brought Mexico and Iran to the negotiating table, and at least nine additional nations, including Afghanistan and Pakistan, have decided that the United States must remain in the war on terror.  Let us be honest. One of the most important ways that the American people have participated in the efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan has been by agreeing that we must make the world safe again. Over the last decade, the number of Americans

That makes this the second year that we have had language in this appropriation bill that has increased this laboratory's funding because in the previous conference report it had to be cut by a further $200,000 because of that proposal to cut the procurement process for some of these laboratories by $200,000. So that will be the increased funding that we are providing in the bill that comes to us this year to accelerate the development and transparency of these State Laboratories.

As an original cosponsor of this bill and in the last Congress of this administration, I must say I have only been able to come to support Cuban freedom from the initial freedom of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers on the 8th of May, 1979, to the unfreezing of Castro's Cuba--the last free democratic government in Latin America. When I was sworn into the House of Representatives, I proudly proclaimed America's opposition to Castro's Cuba, although only after Mariel Cruz Cruz Cruz Gabrielli Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz Cruz libertad

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I would point out simply that the language of this amendment says the expansion of a new refuge of any sort will not affect existing refuge activities or seek to expand existing activities in this area. We are simply saying that the land be divided as has been already agreed upon by the authorizing committees of land utilization in which habitat management is accomplished by timber harvesting. That land has been contiguous land ever since land utilization has been authorized. Forestland acreage in this area has been managed with native grass species, with habitat, and using low-maintenance forests.  This proposed amendment is in direct contradiction to the explicit intent of this land utilization legislation in terms of grazing. I think that the argument that there has to be additional resources in order for this kind of wildlife management is pretty fundamentally a straw man argument. I know that the proponents of the McIntyre amendment can use every shred of logic to make that case.

This is an attack on those who serve them and on those who might have a claim to the protections of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The Roberts court held that support of the right to be free from the protection of unreasonable search and seizure and a right to petition the Government without having your rights violated violates the Smith amendment and the Bill of Rights.  While I would have preferred that this law be more narrowly tailored to protect Federal employees who were unfairly targeted by lawsuits, this legislation will in fact change Federal court process, making the current process less favorable to employees than it was during the Reagan administration.  The administrative burden of getting a job back to Federal employees is vastly reduced. Once these employees get their jobs back, there is a 24-hour review period during which Federal agencies must submit a reemployment proposal which they justify

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2159, the 1998 appropriations bill for foreign operations. As a member of this subcommittee, I want to pay special tribute to the staff of the bill for their efforts in support of this important bill.  Mr. Chairman, this is a tough year for this House in the appropriations process. The subcommittee of jurisdiction for most of these appropriations bills is the Committee on Appropriations and for a few months we did not get the attention of the public that we had earned in Alabama and our Nation's Capital. The tough year in the Committee on Appropriations has prevented the House from conducting effective hearings and carrying out the duties of its Page H8184]]guidance.  I wanted to salute the entire subcommittee staff and particularly to the distinguished staff of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Goss] who did a great job of making the subcommittee aware of the concerns of the public.

Exactly so. All we need to do is pass that. The other alternative, which has been proposed, is to keep the taxes low for the rich and raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the government. The American people want more from their Government than that, and they will not accept that. We are going to have a whole process where we are going to go through all the kinds of pay-go agreements and all those other things that are going to be discussed with this issue over the coming weeks and months and years with sharing ideas, what we think is best, what is not a better way to go, but not having tax increases.

Mr. President, every year since 1986 Congress has passed a resolution celebrating March 25th as Greek Independence Day. The importance of this day should not be missed. Greek Americans contribute to America and have contributed to the United States since the beginning. Greek-Americans have served as teachers, as doctors, and as scientists throughout American history.  Nearly 300 years ago, an Athenian rebellion began when Greek patriots were seeking to restore their ancient homeland. After a long struggle, Greek and American soldiers landed in central Asia to hold off the Moslems. Some historians have argued that these soldiers might have stormed the walls of Constantinople if the monarchy had not invaded the United States.  They successfully landed in the Nicomedia region, where they met the forces of Mussolini and Austria-Hungary, where American soldiers occupied concentration camps and under so-called dictatorship. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered the deportations of American soldiers who had fled the countryside.

As of today, it has been 1,280 days since candidate Clinton promised a national campaign finance reform plan and that campaign finance reform plan has not been brought forward to the American people as a political or policy issue. Only this morning the minority leader brought up another issue of his which is whether the time has come to finally require that all candidates for public office and public office and public office in the future make public the name of their political action committee that gives them attention at events and that makes contributions to political parties that give them attention at events, but that process does not require any checks or balances in the committee or outside party that is associated with that organization. This is a basic issue which has not been brought forward as a political or policy issue, and it should be a political or policy issue on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Mr. President, the second in this series of bills is the Corporate Tax Equity Act, a bill designed to help U.S. businesses make larger capital investments by raising the capital gains tax rate on high-income companies from 35 percent to 50 percent. This bill raises capital investments by $26 billion over 10 years. It increases the investment incentive for those who work in good faith with their employers and raise their capital by the same amount as under current law for the purpose of creating and keeping new jobs in the United States of America to act in the best interest of the United States.  In order to accomplish its purpose, the bill is a two-step process. First, it eliminates the lower 10 percent bracket. The entire bill is indexed for inflation. In short, under this proposal, the highest bracket in 1998 is indexed for inflation, whereas last year it was indexed for less than 5 percent. Secondly, the bill provides an additional bracket to reduce

I thank my colleague and the chairman for consideration of this amendment affecting privately insured credit unions after a reasonable effort to deal with their membership, members who have been active in their communities and unions for years and have been providing assistance to our communities.  On May 1 of this year, the owners of, and the members of, a bankruptcy petition in Norfolk, Virginia filed a petition for dissolution of the Commonwealth credit union notification. The credit union was founded in 1925 as the Chapter 13 credit union, which is described in this resolution. The chapter 13 requirement was passed in the 1930s to protect federally insured credit unions and their assets. Credit unions are not intended as governmental entities and, by law, should be able to operate just as all other financial institutions operate, but to provide an easy and low-cost access for those who lack the funds to become members.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank the managers of the bill for the increase that they have given to the WIC program. It is really a step in the right direction toward bringing it in line with what we call the 1997 and 1998 nutrition budgets for this country. We need to continue to make sure that the needs of our Nation are met in this worthwhile program and we need to continue to make sure that the special needs of our Nation are met in the next millennium. The budget for WIC for 1997 is $1 billion below the 1998 budget request and below the 1993 request. I want to especially focus on the upcoming bill. This bill is a bill that is clearly not up for reauthorization because it does not meet the requirements of the safety net. We know what happened in 1994. We know what happened last year in WIC and how disastrous this program has become. We also know that the challenge of

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize seasonal base plans for Federal milk marketing orders. This program encourages dairy farmers to stabilize their markets with stable prices and help small producers compete in an increasingly complex global marketplace. As we consider the budget proposal for the Department of the Interior, I want to make clear that there will be no cuts to the program during the budget proposal process and plan to support its continued growth through the next year.  In fiscal year 1998, the Farm Service Agency provided 18,725 farm-related nutrition assistance direct payments to State agricultural commodity funds. These payments are a critical component of a successful livestock production strategy. Currently, Federal livestock producers play an integral role in the stabilizing of U.S. markets, thereby enabling American agriculture producers to do more with less. These payments complement a stable market, which promotes healthy weather conditions, free market prices and efficient distribution of commodities to consumers.  In light of the

Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the amendment that my colleague from New Hampshire has offered this morning. Let me say at the outset, and I say it in regard to this amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire because what he is doing is giving American consumers and companies another reason not to buy the products of the Japanese because it is not good for American consumers and it is not good for our country if we continue to price them out of the market.  As Senator Smith knows, I have sponsored legislation to give American consumers that same chance to buy the goods and services of the Japanese without having to pay more than the rate they pay in the United States. He is making a very strong case on that issue. This year, for the first time since the end of World War II, we are going to have the opportunity to buy at full price Japanese and Chinese goods that we buy at full price in the United States, products that might

Mr. Chairman I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by my colleagues, an amendment that would gut the market access program. We revisit it again today because it is a very important program, and I feel very strongly about it.  This program gives our small businesses a competitive advantage in the Asian market. Last year it was the second largest recipient of Federal Maine grant funding, and it is very important.  This program is extremely important to my home State of Maine because it is the only Federal program that provides small businesses with extensive tools and resources to gut foreign market barriers.  First, the program helps the government form marketing partnerships and cross-sell services. By opening up new markets in Asia and focusing on specific countries, the government can use a State's information, its relations with other States, and the domestic network it maintains to influence foreign competition in the service and supply sectors.  Secondly, the Maine program helps achieve lower trade

I think, Mr. Speaker, certainly tax burdens for working families have reached new heights in recent history. As my friend pointed out, the first 120 days has been a year of rising taxes on working families. Over the last 2 years that has been reached a limit.  One of the things we are going to address on this legislation is to reduce burdens on working families, particularly on working families that are working more than 50 hours per week. The next year, it is going to be the first 100 days, if you will. As my friend pointed out, more than half of the families working at least 40 hours per week, 70 percent are just about in the middle. It is critical that we target that toward working families and working on this legislation, if at all possible, as an attempt to move things forward, but, rather, to have it move through the bill, and we do not need, we do not need this Christmas.

Mr. Speaker, well, America has a serious problem with energy prices. If you just peruse today's Wall Street Journal and New York Times, you will see our Nation price our fuel at about $4 a gallon to fuel the vehicles we drive. It is a 40 percent increase from the year before this occurred. We pay $4 per gallon to buy gas from the billion dollar United States crude oil industry that we are importing from the Middle East and this Nation that gets 60 to 80 percent of its oil here from the Persian Gulf. That is absolutely not fair to the American consumer who has to pay that. If it is WTO subsidized, the auto manufacturers will no longer produce vehicles in America that will be able to compete and be competitive with other American products.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman, in fiscal year 1994, this program was funded at $106 million. The bill before us cuts that number by $66 million. That is a cut of $10 million, and it is an offset to increase the amount of money that we spend to support this program in fiscal year 1995 and thereafter which is $20 million less than the President requested last year and $5 million less than the Chairman recommended in fiscal year 1994. We do not cut this program that much below the level in the committee report that would allow us to rise from last year's level to this year's level and bring this program into balance. The money that is cut from this program is a real cut. It is an offset.  In fiscal year 1995, Mr. Chairman, this program will have been frozen at $176 million, except for one point of interest.

Mr. Speaker, the death tax kills small family-owned businesses, it makes financial planning nearly impossible, and it is an unfair form of double taxation. The Speaker of the House must be given one final chance to come up with a truly true family-owned business bill that would help struggling families with their hard-earned money and double the standard deduction so that no family will be left behind in this current economic time. Unfortunately the plan the House is being told to vote for today is nothing more than another deadbeat family-owned business plan that will not do anything to keep alive our struggling small businesses.  Under the health care reform bill passed by Congress, if a single family owner loses their job through no fault of their own, they will not lose any of their tax deductions. They will have to declare a loss of $10,000. Now, that is right. A family-owned business owner is a business man. They must have the ability

Mr. Chair, this amendment would allow Secretary Bernhardt to kill this proposal in pursuit of information we already have. My colleagues across the aisle continually repeat what Secretary Bernhardt has done in the past that I have said I don't believe he should be required to hand over sensitive information to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in pursuit of personal politics.  I am particularly concerned about Secretary Bernhardt's desire to get behind the Chair and expand his individual political network. Does his personal ideology not go above and beyond what the Nation requires for a Chair? My guess is, it does, and you know it.  Now, Secretary Bernhardt has publicly stated that his political networks will not exist as soon as the current majority in this body takes power.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor New York State Trooper Andrew Sperr. Each person who wears a badge walks a thin blue line between protecting us and doing harm to others. One way that Officer Sperr has been able to keep us safe in the time he has been with us is by keeping us safe from those who would do us harm with nothing more than the chance to have a drink and get some more of their money at the bar or just come and get it that way and feel Americans down here.  It has been almost 11 years since Officer Sperr lost his life in the line of duty and nearly 5 years since he gave his life to the people of New York State. He passed away peacefully and in his own family's own way on August 21.  Officer Sperr was raised on a family farm in Walton County in west central New York and would go on to complete several years in the Army.

Well, Rush Limbaugh is at it again. Unable to defend an indefensible war in Iraq, he has once again resorted to ``sliming'' the messenger. In today's cable announcement on Monday morning with his brand new FOX News show on his new radio program called ``The Rush Hour,'' the Fox News host accused the women of Congress of actually being the most anti-war force in America as he said that ``one of the most important things we should be doing is not being in Iraq anymore than we should be in war country today.'' He went on to claim that the war in Iraq is so unpopular it's time for a change and that the women of Congress won't win the Medal of Honor. I guess I would just say that if the war in Iraq is so unpopular, there are a lot of other unpopular things that need to be done in Iraq. Perhaps we should start with getting out of there.

The Senate will not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act until December 1 of next year, and the House will not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act until July 1 of next year. That means that 20 million Americans will drop their health insurance next year alone because of rising costs, increased out-of-pocket expenses, and insurance companies going into bankruptcy and being forced to raise rates for millions of people. It means 10 million Americans will lose $1 billion in coverage and another 10 million will lose $800 billion in healthcare due to their preexisting conditions. And it means over 2 million seniors will lose their benefits, and 5 million children will lose their health insurance.  Many

I thank the Senator from Nebraska for raising the issue. I think, as of yet, we are not quite sure how many Senators wish to speak on this, but it would be a good idea if we could unanimous consent that there be a 2-hour time limit for Senator Kerry to present his budget proposal as well as Senator Warner.  The first Democratic budget that came up on the Senate floor this year included $20 billion of cuts in funding for low-income children raising afterschool programs, Head Start, and summer programs that are in Nebraska that are instrumental to a strong community life and in education in our State, which is the fastest growing part of the State.  Let me give another example from the Governor of Nebraska. There are kids who go through Head Start. They do well. A significant number of Head Start programs in Nebraska survive on just one dime of private support.  In my State, the Head Start program, which

Mr. Chairman, I want to speak in opposition to the point of order raised against the important counternarcotics human rights provision in this bill. The last time the rule of law was attacked on the floor of the House by a Member of the opposition party, it was by an anti-immigrant extremist. I think it is about time that we give it a real fight.  To the American people, this amendment, just a few weeks ago, passed with such overwhelming support in both Houses of Congress and in the Administration.

Madam President, I would like to respond to the statement made by the Republican whip, my friend from Texas, Senator Cornyn. This is day 20 of our extended Government shutdown. One day longer and it has already cost American families $17 billion in lost economic growth and over 1 million Americans in lost home and voting security. Today the President will be in Washington and a far greater number of Americans will not be able to vote in the United States Senate because the majority leader will not let a vote come up on any extension of the Federal Government when he takes office next week and it will have to be filled by Democrats. That is why Senator Cornyn made that statement. We can have all the money and we can come back for another extension after the fact. So that is why he made that statement, to deflect attention from the numbers.  I will say this, however, though the President will be in Washington tomorrow, he will have an opportunity

We are making sure that we are adding to our reserve fund, as opposed to being one of the big players in deploying a killer instinct down in a defensive mode against conventional conventional warfare.

We have a responsibility together on many issues and there will always be the ability to have a strong and strong debate as to whether we ought to support that amendment or not support that amendment or to want to not support it but to think on its merits whether we ought to support it or not support it.

FEMA has outlined a process for expedited and retroactive applications, and they also are expecting, they have requested, since March, they are going to start reimbursing a greater percentage to states than was promised in the Governor's loan guarantee, despite the Governor's fact that we have written to him on numerous occasions to say, this is unacceptable.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Is the Senator going to use that example again of Jefferson's saying that he was opposed to the Federal Government's going into debt for an authority that is in fact an Federal Government mandate and that they ought to be defended under that law? I do not believe this amendment would have that effect because this would say that nothing in this amendment would be prohibited by the so-called `` opposed-to-the-Federal-government-mandate Act.'' So it is this idea of a way to make the so-called Federal Government act within certain limited nature that it will probably respond to the public health issue as we go along with a very large spending program to cure a very large number of problems. This would come as a reaction to the Government's going into debt for an authority it has no responsibility to enforce, and it says this was done for a reason.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Exxon is earning $90,000 an hour, about $2 million a day, or nearly $800 million a year, on the same $5 billion as long as the gas tax in the State of Tennessee is exempt. Exxon could deduct that over the next 4 years as revenue.  The gas tax is a revenue-raising device, a way to lure investment that drives private sector jobs, but it is the tax money that pays for pensions for Federal workers who will retire in the future because coffers are empty, because the pension funds are bankrupt, because it doesn't provide for Social Security for women who could be retired with the same retirement, because all other Federal retiree pension funds are bankrupt. Only boxer Floyd Mayweather gets a pension to retire because Floyd's income could not match the income of many others in the State of Tennessee.

So it would not be too surprising that the Republican leadership seems poised to further weaken the program this week as well.

So there is a concern here. This was in the last farm bill, the farm bill, in the year 1992. In 1992 we began to hear again from farmers in America about the big program that this has.

So we are happy that this is the first of many so that we can go back and give the American people a better product which we have been building up over the last several months since the services of the two first leaders of the largest or the most important area of criminal justice reform in the history of this country--the 1996 crime bill.  And again, as the Senator from Oregon so eloquently stated, this is a historic event. This is a case in which the vast majority of Americans agree with the bill and know the facts. So we are pleased to hear this great bipartisan victory today.

Mr. President, I wanted to make sure that those people who worked on this side of the aisle on the last piece of legislation, which I had the privilege to have voted for and vote against, would know that I do not want to change any votes I have made in the Senate in the name of that piece of legislation. I think it has been well considered. The recognition of some provision of it was approved by the two leaders.  I have made clear to everyone in this body that we do not want to kill this legislation. That is why I have come out in opposition to this motion to waive the Budget Act. We need to do it to stop waste in the Federal budget. But we do not want to kill the bill by unanimous consent.  I did not intend for this to take the form of an amendment. I do not want any effort by my colleagues to kill the bill. It is an opportunity for Senator Bond

Mr. President, I am very pleased today to introduce the Small Business Growth and Opportunity Act of 2004 along with my Finance Committee colleague, Senator Bond, along with Senator Coverdell, which would increase the maximum assets for low- and middle-income small business owners from $5 million to $10 million and to prohibit Section 13(a) of the act from being in effect for 5 years. I appreciate the cooperation of Chairman Gramm, the distinguished ranking member, Senator Gorton, and Senator Leahy, all who have graciously accepted this initiative.  Small businesses continue to be extremely important to our country and will play a significant role in economic growth and job creation. However, their economic and job growth prospects are often limited because of regulation that interferes with the very business which makes small business possible. The Growth In America Act of 1994 requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to conduct a study on the issue

He also served as the youngest enlisted member to parachute into Afghanistan in 2006. His family and friends said that it was his belief that Tanner would be one of the first sons born in Afghanistan to be deployed, having served not just in the U.S. Army but in both the Air Force and the Marine Corps.

One important factor that has been lacking in efforts to deal with the problem of the underinflated Federal budget has been the agreement to insure the Government. It is wrong to keep the Government funding a portion of private industry's health care costs and that is the real issue.

As I said yesterday, the legislation represents a bipartisan effort to provide Congress with a plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit by approximately $12 billion by the year 2002 in the Committee on Appropriations by requiring more Federal agencies to adopt a more skilled workforce and assist employers in making these personnel necessary in the 1980's and 1990's when farm labor was in high demand and has now been largely eliminated from the federal work force in the last 5 years. In Colorado and around the country, small businesses, farmers, and service providers want to reduce their Federal workforce to the levels necessary to provide adequate income.

Mr. Chairman, nearly a decade ago the farmers and families in the Klamath Basin suffered irreparable harm when two government agencies with conflicting demands and national policy cut the contract of John D. Tierney and his family farm to the California Department of Water Resources. This day is now long past due and all that is left is to ensure that the Federal Government is held to the same standards it has set for the agricultural communities it is now trying to house.  In this particular case, however, those standards are not met by the Agricultural Land Conservation Service. The agricultural lands on which this land has been cultivated by farming families are agricultural lands covered with irrigation and by wetlands, yet the State of California has determined that they would be affected by the action taken by this agency. In fact, a very controversial city ordinance that California would impose if the Farmers Home Administration were removed from this farm would not just cover agriculture--it would also cover urban areas.

I have decided to withdraw this amendment because $10 million in radio and television subsidies is not going to do much to advance the cause of freedom. The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) stated the exact opposite. Those who oppose the AMT know that the AMT is more about bandwagons. We, on the Committee on the Budget, know that the AMT was not enacted to force televisions to play all the national music. In fact, this would be a stealth attack on the public's constitutional right to receive a free air and television service. It is, of course, more about soft money; earmarking money.

Mr. Speaker, last Congress I introduced the only health reform legislation that truly had bipartisan support. The Rowland-Bilirakis bill focused on areas where there was bipartisan support but which had less than 60 percent public support and ultimately died because the Senate would not allow health care reform to go to a vote on the House floor.  Although I introduced the legislation in the last Congress, that bill never became law. Today, we finally have a bill that is truly comprehensive and does something that I believe should be done. We must have a serious debate about the future of health care and limit the government's control of the future of health care.  Under the Rowland-Bilirakis bill, each State would have four health care organizations that would meet over the 10-year period. The National Conference of State Legislatures would then score each State's health care plans and submit a national health care scorecard. Each State would be able to establish health care

Mr. President, From 1950 to 1953, the United States was in the midst of a bitter war on the Korean peninsula. As the inscription at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the In the Korean War states, American citizens who ``served honorably'' in the war in the Second World War will ``never forget their sacrifice for the success of American democracy.''  On September 11, 1962, before Senator Thomas Eagleton in this Chamber, Congress approved the establishment of the United States Department of State. At that time, I had the privilege of visiting with Secretary of State John McNamara and the rest of the newly empowered American Ambassador to Korea. That was a long way from the actual invasion of Korea. Then, in 1950, there were no international tensions between the United States and the Communist People's Republic of China and the status quo.  The U.S. military presence in Korea was minimal. At the time, the Korean War

I thank the gentlelady. I believe that California's laws are far more sane than the laws of many other States, particularly the laws of my own State of New Jersey. People in California have more in common with people across the world than people in most States in the United States who live and work in another country with less gun control than the people in California and, indeed, about as much in common with people across the world as people in California or even some States in this country will be with people in other countries in the 20 millionth century. So I am a little bit skeptical about the so-called assault weapons ban that the Democrats are trying to pass in California because I do not know that they can line the pockets of the gun owners in California with assault weapons.  It is just my judgment that if you have been in that business a year, you will not find that any company will be willing to sell a lot more weapons

It is a concern not only of the housing authorities that are getting help, because it seems to me, and the gentleman from New York makes an excellent point, there is a need for public notification, the purpose of which is to make sure there is some public debate on the subject of housing problems as we deal with a housing crisis around our country, and if this chart has been going through the gallery, there is a single green number on this chart,

In 1994 the Senate passed legislation that established the Native American Housing Trust Fund Act of 1994. As a member of that subcommittee I have been very involved in legislation to improve the way the Federal Government pays for certain Indian housing programs, especially in the last decade and the bill that has been finally signed into law, the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, that would provide Native American housing assistance.  I must say that this act is not perfect. It does not address all the problems that Native Americans experience or the overall level of poverty they face.

Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me the time. I agree, the current welfare system does not work. It should be replaced by a system where States have the authority to choose whether to provide assistance or not to those who need it the most.  The Children's Health Insurance Program is one example of the successful alternatives that we could provide today to the welfare state. Today, the CHIP Program is having a positive effect in helping low-income children and their families.  In Texas, the child-poverty rate has plummeted since the start of the program. CHIP is also very popular in Alabama, Missouri, and Texas, where almost 80 percent of the caseload is low-income children. CHIP is also responsible for helping 30,000 children move off welfare and get into productive lives, with no waiting list for medical care.  I am heartened to see that Federal support for CHIP is

In other words, pharmaceutical companies have just gained $1 billion with this bill.

It would appear that prices are going up and profits are going down with this $1 billion of profits that is being taken from the Medicare Program in order to pay for $140 million of profits that companies have made just percent longer.

In the past 5 years, this House has voted more than 3,300 times to raise the minimum wage. Only six times, by the way, did this House succeed in passing a minimum wage increase.  I support the minimum wage increase because it is time for this House to act on the issue of job security for American workers. We need to make sure our small businesses, who produce the

Probably because I am a peacenik, I just am, have been, I think I was born that way. But, you know, before we talk about the President of the United States and his policies for this country and our opportunity to be competitive in a global marketplace and to create good American jobs and have a competitive global economy and create alternatives to the red-tape of the current economic system and create an opportunity for a new and better system in which the United States can be an example to other countries in the world and a model that all other countries can follow when it comes to introduced markets and fiscal policies as opposed to the current one that penalizes every effort that we can make to grow our economy and create economic growth that can create jobs and earn our way in the world market.  I hope my friend will share this with us as a State at least.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If that bill solved that one thing, if it just said to the average American who doesn't get employer-provided insurance, we will let you buy that when it gets here, and the Government will put it in your hands. That is not the American way. That is not the American way that this country has been in a long time. It is not the American way that we have had this United States Congress take this entire healthcare debate into the 25th century, and not even have a vote on it yet. We are a Nation of Massachusetts, so we know the history of this country.  But I believe that the American people, whether we are Democrats or Republicans, do understand this is a crisis in healthcare, and we can fix this, and it is time for Democrats and Republicans to join together, work together, and have a bipartisan approach to solving this, and not in the fires of partisan politics.  I thank the gentleman from

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3289, which provides supplemental appropriations to our national defense and the reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since the war in Iraq began more than a year ago, we have made unprecedented progress in addressing the serious security concerns facing our troops. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has made it clear that we are facing grave threats to our security that demand immediate attention. Our military must be fully prepared for any threat to our country and our Nation should not hesitate to deploy forces to fight terrorism and to protect our homeland. We must continue to provide these brave men and women the tools to accomplish these missions.  While we have made considerable progress in Iraq, unfortunately, the root causes of the insurgency and the violence continue to plague the people of Iraq. The continued presence of sectarian elements on the ground, perpetuated by the Mujahideen militias, pose a grave threat to the Iraqi people

I mean, come on--$387,000. I loved this one, too, $4 million for a new bike path trail in Massachusetts so people can get to the grocery store without having to drive 2 miles to get here and take a little walk in the middle of the afternoon or maybe get on a road where they really have to drive to get to the food in the North End where they have to eat and stay alive. I think we just needed a little bit more of that here. I know we are trying to keep everything else in the House, so I loved this one. I am happy that we had $386,000.  There is a lot of money in this bill. I was hoping maybe there would be an opportunity for those Members who are, like my grandmother was, who never got sick but had to take care of her elderly at that time to be able to get a new health care plan through Medicare if that was necessary. I think

Now, Mr. Speaker, that sounds like a pretty good proposal to me, and let us see how many of our colleagues here who tell us that we should just send our children to college and they are going to be here all the time are going to vote for this great idea when you really are going to be getting Social Security all to yourself with this huge tax cut just in the name of the next generation that we are going to be running the thing for you so you know what you are getting in true bipartisan fashion. You are going to be getting something here that you know you are getting so you know how much you are really getting but pretty soon you will be getting some kind of lump sum inheritance. What a terrible idea.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I thank the majority leader. This will be good news in Marianna, FL, where Pete Peterson is waiting for word on his new assignment. He may be coming home in the next day or two when we get that announcement today from the Vietnam administration and we move the National Guard to a position of increased responsibility in that area with the National Guard being one of the first to be moved from the Joint National Guard headquarters at the Friday night ceremony Friday night Friday night Monday morning Monday morning Tuesday morning Tuesday. We will have that announcement from the Vietnam administration as soon as it is announced.  I yield the floor and thank the majority leader.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
