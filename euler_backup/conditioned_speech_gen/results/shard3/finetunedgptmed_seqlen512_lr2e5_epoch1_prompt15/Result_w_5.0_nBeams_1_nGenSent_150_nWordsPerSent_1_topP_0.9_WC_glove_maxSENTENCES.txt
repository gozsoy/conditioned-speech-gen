Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was willing to stand up for the middle class and the underdog in a way that the GOP candidate is not. Clinton stood up to his party and Republican Congress and Republicans in the Senate and Republican President Bush when the GOP was not willing to stand up to its voters. Clinton stood up to the billionaire and the tax breaks for the wealthiest in this country, the Bill Clinton tax breaks for the wealthy. The issue then was about the health care issue. He stood up to the medical freedom issue, the same issue that he tried to fix on welfare, where he said no. He is standing up now to the tax break for the well off, the estate tax, the capital gains tax, which is on the middle class, when that class didn't get anything

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing to ensure that all of us have a fair shot at the American Dream. The bill I am introducing with Congressmen Rangel and Pascrell is the first step in ensuring that our workers have a fair shot to compete for jobs in America's highest technology companies. It does this by requiring companies to allow workers to collectively bargain to make gains for themselves and their companies in their benefits package and in their hiring policy.  This legislation will provide workers with a way to organize to eliminate discrimination against their rights and give them a fair shot at a good job in America's highest technology companies. It will also bring a commitment to supporting our Nation's immigrant communities by providing legal and legal assistance to undocumented workers. These are important programs, and I would like to

I would not impute that to the Senator from West Virginia, as I did not have the opportunity to have our discussion with him on that point because we were here when he made that statement in support of the Clinton family giving money to the Clinton Presidential Library Foundation that was going to have direct opposition to the President in the future. We were not there with him when he made that statement that we would have problems with this agreement because we would have a continuing veto because of our concern that there would be money going to the Clinton library and for things that the White House would have to do and would take back money.

Mr. Chairman, I understand there is a need to address the issue of property tax relief for Federal construction projects in this bill, and I have reservations about the manner in which that is to be accomplished. This bill is not comprehensive. It is not comprehensive because it would leave Federal property tax relief largely untouched.  The subcommittee's work on the rest of this bill, however, will save us a lot of money and improve the overall quality of our Federal property tax policy. And because of the nature of this bill, it can be done in a thoughtful and careful way.

Mr. President, the second amendment I had offered says that before the United States-India agreement is even finalized, India must be willing to pursue a nuclear weapon first in America and then for more than 20 years thereafter in Afghanistan as well as Pakistan. My second amendment would have said that if we find out that India intends to use or is considering or has already started to use a nuclear weapon first or with respect to Pakistan it would not be counted against that ban on the first 20 years it is used there either in the President's proposed nuclear agreement with India or in the President's proposed nuclear agreement with Pakistan. But now in the Congress we cannot vote on a nuclear treaty unless the American people see that first 20 years of American military action would be counted against it. That is why I think that the American people need to know the intent of the

Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about this outsourcing bill and its tenor. If you look at the definition of outsourcing under this bill, it clearly does not include outsourcing to certain countries of manufacturing or exporting certain technology to certain countries of technology because we know that this bill would have a direct impact on American jobs by allowing workers to be replaced in these countries without the ability to seek to have their own workplace protections based on fair labor practices or the right to engage in collective bargaining rights and other workplace protections based on these facts.  So I am very concerned about this bill, and I think that this is yet another reason why this administration is not really leading on some of the key issues that we face today in this country. This is just another example of how this administration is not a very good leader when it comes to trade policy,

So what I say to Medicare patients is, you cannot get Medicare Advantage if Medicare is only going to pay 50 percent of your premiums. Medicaid cuts 50 percent of your spending.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2947 is a bill that authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept the State of South Dakota as a site for the site selection and design of the U.S. Park Service headquarters building on the Crow Tribe reservation in South Dakota and the City of Parks and Recreation in the City of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  The State of South Dakota is the seat of the State senate. Last month the U.S. House of Representatives passed the National Park Service authorization by a voice vote in a sense of Congress. With that bill in hand in the Senate, we can move that process along quickly and get the first step begun on a long overdue project for this important agency. I urge all Members to support the legislation as it is currently constructed and work

Mr. Chairman, one of the things I admire the most about our country is our constitutional democracy. We do not really get to have all the things that people think about our country getting to do in terms of the politics of choice. But to choose the right law in the law book is really something that is at the heart of what makes America so great. And when you do that, it seems to me that we need to focus on education, education and tax reform, because we have got to be better stewards of this money and this tax money that we are giving to our students, and that is in fact in jeopardy right now if we do not act.  For the first time in our Nation's history, we will have graduated more of our high school seniors in this country without an education than are in other developed nations.

Mr. Speaker, my friend, Mr. Thomas, the chairman of the awesome and powerful Ways and Means Committee, has just said some very fine things about the bill that is before us today and is basically at his desk waiting for somebody to take it up and move it through a normal legislative process to get to the President to sign it, to pass it on the House floor.  I know some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have raised concerns about it and about some of the provisions that I have supported in this bill and some provisions I may be in favor of in the future in this bill. I could probably quote as many of my own quotes about some of the provisions that have been increased, increases that I think have been modest. But the important point here is that this bill is absolutely massive, it is almost $250

Since the tax cut that the Recovery Act increased in 2001, the number of jobs created has increased by more than 50 percent and the stock market has continued to soar higher than ever.

I also think we should emphasize that we have not improved the overall health care situation that we have in the United States or in any other country.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill that imposes meaningful farm payment limitations. The bill we are introducing will limit farmers from receiving more than $15,000 for a 2-year period, the amount under current law which covers mortgages for a family farm and the loan for a family farm. We believe this would set a very good example for the rest of America to follow. I will be pleased to work with Senator Hatch to bring this legislation to the floor for consideration.  Since 1947, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act has been the only Federal farm program that permanently limits payments to farmers for home mortgages. This agreement was made in 1992 because of a 1993 farm bill reform bill which restructured the program and created a new chapter 2 program.  However, this agreement also included a number of important exceptions that supported the U

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the bi-partisan amendment sponsored by my good friend from California to strike $1 million for an agency that has been extremely difficult for the Department of Agriculture to comply with the National Agricultural Policy Act of 1992. In short, this amendment would give USDA the last bite at the apple in an effort to fund the State Department agency in the budget for 1995 and beyond. At the same time, it would take a step in the direction of Congressional oversight of the Department of Agriculture to make sure that the new agency before us meets the demands of the Nation's new agricultural policy priorities.  Mr. Chairman, this subcommittee had a hearing on this very subject earlier this year on the fiscal year 1996 Agriculture bill which the Committee on the Budget voted to adopt on a voice vote and provide the entire fiscal year 1996 Agriculture

Yes, the gentleman is correct. School food authorities must have maximum flexibility to plan menus and provide services to meet the nutritional needs of their food patrons. These plans must comply with the same educational and cost-effective guidelines established by the Department of Education in order to ensure that public school students receive proper nutrition. The data in this report clearly indicates that school food service policy is in agreement with this principle and is in compliance with the guidelines to be revised in the Nutrition and Education Act of 2000 to be effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year 1995 school year.   installations not meet nutrition standards.--Because the amendments to this section are made to clarify the intent of the Technical Corrections Act of 1988, Federal laws on food safety and nutritional information should be considered in the developing and final regulations and recommendations to implement this section of the act.

In their very first National Energy Day celebration in 2008, the Bush administration put out this poll to encourage the United States to turn the corner on energy security.  And that is exactly what we did, because we told our oil companies, ``It's time to take control of our energy security so we can fulfill our promises to the American people.''  In fact, the Bush administration promised us a plan to dramatically reduce our oil dependence and keep us on the road to energy independence, and they kept us on that track with this poll that they put out to look for energy as if they had been here for the

Those principles were put into the Declaration of Independence because it is the highest and best form of government, and they remain true today.  The term ``self-help'' is used to describe the actions of individuals, often people on welfare. Unfortunately, self-help means you should go along with whatever program you are following to relieve yourself of the poverty you have in your family or the welfare you have to shoulder.

I had the opportunity to look at the new President and to see that he took action.  The Environmental Protection Agency, which has been around since before I was born, has the responsibility to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens. Congress, in the midst of a recession, has done a tremendous job of moving the agency from one goal--protecting the environment--to another--protecting the workers of our Nation. As a result, they have produced record standards. Every business in America has standards, most of them very rigorous.

By 1993, at the end of that budget year, our Federal debt will exceed $6 trillion.

Mr. Speaker, the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has made available to the public a 1995 summary of the Joint Committee on Taxation's findings on the amendment to the tax law passed by Congress in 1993 and introduced in the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Boehlert, Ms. Hartzler and Mr. Daschle for their initiative in including in the Joint Committee's 1995 estimate of the effect on Americans' household income and outlays reported by the Joint Committee.  While not a complete, complete, comprehensive evaluation, the Joint Committee on Taxation's 1995 findings clearly reflect the economic and fiscal impacts of President Clinton's tax legislation. The report does indicate the unanticipated impact of the Clinton tax increase on the budget and receipts of the Federal Government, the administration and the IRS.  Mr. Speaker,

Mr. President, over the weekend the administration announced its decision to impose trade sanctions beginning July 4 on a range of individuals and companies operating in China. It is worth noting that while trade sanctions are typically used to discourage transactions, sanctions can also drive transactions abroad. For example, we have seen this in the case of intellectual property rights used to target consumer goods and software.  A significant portion of the world's exports to China, including some of the best-selling agricultural goods exported to China, are directed to and through South Korea and Japan. As of June, as many as 35 percent of South Korean exports to China were to China. South Korean exports to China are the second largest of any country.

Mr. Speaker, after 2 years of being stricken and terrified with a Democrat House of Representatives from Washington, I am shocked that I have voted for $24 million in earmarks.  More money for one State than in each of the 5 years I have been a Member of Congress will do little to address what needs to be done in the Nation's capital and the country of Washington, D.C. Members need to realize that their vote was not motivated by anything other than a desire to spend less money here in Washington D.C. The Republicans seem to believe that the people who voted for the Democratic tax increase will give them the same amount of money they are putting into education and roads and other things like that. It is absolutely absurd and insulting.  The American people are tired of the House Democrats' earmarks, which are

I think it is important that we talk about what the President did in his Budget Director, Edwin Meese, in the first year of this bill that gave the Congress the funds we needed for the Commission. It is interesting because this is the time when the Commerce Department, in its first year of this bill, said that it had got to be done within the stated time that the administration had proposed, and that the Committee on the Budget then, and the House in the beginning of this year, has supported it and have adopted it, but the time when the administration told the Congress that they wanted the Commission to go out on the limb

Mr. Chairman, as we draw to a close on this important and very important debate over the issue of whether the government is authorized to make it illegal to work in America, we should reflect on how we got here and what it is that we are doing here today in this House and what we have done in the past and what is going to happen in the future.  It is important to note that we did not get here because of the fact that some on the other side of the aisle do not like government. They do not like government that has the capability to help those who need help and to those who can help themselves. They do not like government that can work with the community to help the community and to the community which should always be the most efficient way of doing things.

We have not made an independent judgment that any criminal activity occurred in the private loans made to this company that it is now attempting to own, but it should be condemned as something that the government should investigate.

Mr. Speaker, over a million Americans, including 200,000 young Americans, are living with type 1 diabetes. Over 1 in every 25 adults will develop the disease by the age of 40. Young adults alone are the target group for many of these diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 35 percent of American adults are at risk for developing type 1 diabetes. It is estimated that diabetes among young adults contributes to more than 300,000 health problems and affects more than 50 million Americans.  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that, over a decade, $130 billion will be spent on diabetes research and public programs to prevent and control the disease.

It has been so important and so kind of special to me and I am very appreciative of his hard work in getting us to this point.  For this amendment to be so successful we need to make some tough choices about how we are going to get to the other 22 agencies that this administration says they will close down. That is why this amendment has to be adopted. There are a few things in this bill that are important to me that this bill will not close down; however, I cannot allow the Senate to take this amendment out of the bill and not take care of it and then when we come to conference on this bill and the

Education is one of the most important issues that we can have with the Federal Government. The Federal Government has made strides in providing educational opportunities for the many children in our schools as well as our community and our Nation. However, more needs to be done to ensure that the children that attend and benefit from these educational opportunities have all the educational benefits that they can afford to receive.  The Children's Health Insurance Program provides health care coverage for children that are uninsured or underinsured. According to the Children's Health Insurance Program, from 1997 through 2005, an additional 25 million children, all

In the past there have been extreme legislative bills that come to the floor and the Congress has been in full debate. We have allowed that to take place but we have not yet had the kind of executive branch oversight that we ought to have here in the Congress. This bill does just that and will not turn the executive branch into a rubber stamp or do anything to prevent President Bush from continuing to circumvent Congress and executive branch authority in the future.  This bill would require that executive branch agencies report to Congress on their oversight and will do so at the end of each quarter

This is a significant opportunity for ANWR to fully participate in this critical conservation effort and benefit the nation. The Outer Continental Shelf [OCS] is the fourth largest amount of land on earth and is the largest on the face of the Earth due to the amount of ice that it contains. The recovery of this resource is an opportunity for our Nation to build strong partnerships with affected communities that will see their economies grow through the improved economic stability of this resources.

Yet there is something we can all do to help save the lives of these hardworking Americans who are so often at their most vulnerable. The American Cancer Society estimates that every 15 minutes a woman is killed in the United States from breast cancer. While this number is still only one of the few causes of death for the total U.S. population, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than half of all U.S. deaths are from the causes of cancer and only five percent are directly due to an environmental factor.

Mr. Speaker, I draw your attention to this particular chart here. As of today, it is close to $3 trillion in deficit spending because Congress does not need to do the budget for a growing economy and high inflation rates. With the majority of Republicans and with the Republican majority in the White House, there has been no serious consideration of what this country needs to do in order to meet the fiscal challenges that we all face. When the President said that he wanted to bring down the national debt to 5 years of the 4 percent growth that has been displayed in the last few years by Congress and the Federal Government, that is when he put together his annual budget for 1996 that suggested cutting $3 trillion out of the national debt over the next 10 years.

Mr. President, the second in this series of bills is the Corporate Tax Equity Act, which is the corporate tax equity act we will be talking about in a moment. It has, as President Trump noted, passed both Houses of Congress. It provides for the appropriate incentives to corporations to set their tax returns and to have their cash balances close to where they were.  There are many issues with the current corporate tax structure. This bill focuses specifically on one. It encourages the continued utilization of low-rate corporations. It also would also encourage corporations to use the limited credit available under the present system. This bill allows corporations to voluntarily set their own particular tax rate, with or without the effect of an increase in their Tax Code.

While the House passed this legislation with overwhelming support in both bodies in early September, the President and the leadership in the White House have failed to honor that important commitment by refusing to provide the American people with needed funding for essential war needs. The U.S. Government should be funding the vital military needs of the warfighter who put their lives on the line to support America in the fight against terrorism and throughout the world. However, we cannot expect any response from the President that will provide adequate funding for such vital responsibilities.

Mr. Speaker, since March of last year, a shroud has covered a plaque on the House of Representatives that reads ``The Golden Rule is the law of the land.'' As I look at this plaque today in the gallery and I hear my children reading it out loud and I hear children standing on the edge of the marble floor in the other room as they ask if this is the law of the land that we are going to follow if we are to have a child-free society in this country, I can see the actions of those who would not allow the Golden Rule to be the law of the land. If the Golden Rule is the law of the land that my kids and their children are going to follow, then this amendment is what I would do to take this away from them so that they have the same right as all the other

The current recommendation is that milk samples be collected from the very start of the milk production season. However, this provision is ill-advised and must be reauthorized.  Senator Dole and I have written a letter to Secretary Ross of the Agriculture Department recommending that the base plant milk standards be revised to provide for a greater timeframe of 4 weeks for collection and delivery of milk samples in order to minimize the risk of human disease.

That is why the National Governors Association is furious with this huge expansion of Medicaid. The National Governors Association says this is a disaster for the states.  Let me say that in my State of Washington, the law requires the private insurance industry to provide coverage for children up to 12 years old unless the family member is disabled or those with life-threatening conditions that require medical care. It has to cover everyone in the family except for three children that are between 6 and 12 years old, and in most cases those three children have a disability that requires them to be hospitalized. In addition, they live in an area that is subject to several other problems. This coverage is required under the State constitution.  How would the Medicaid expansion in the plan lead to higher prices for the employer and those small businesses? You cannot tell me that they are

Mr. Speaker, the death tax kills small family-owned businesses, it makes financial planning nearly impossible, and it hurts hard-working Americans trying to make ends meet while providing hardworking corporations with easy tax breaks. That is why I am proud to have sponsored legislation to eliminate it once and for all.  For the past 20 years, Congress has failed to eliminate the death tax on small family-owned businesses because they can effectively escape it by using alternative filing methods for most small businesses as well as foreign firms. But this year I introduced legislation that simply makes it impossible for businesses to escape the death tax if they use an alternative payment method to avoid it.  To be exact, the bill eliminates the death tax on capital gains for first-time home buyers. When an individual buys a house it comes with a life insurance policy which limits the amount he

Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Bryan, in introducing the Consumer Reporting Reform Act of 1995. This legislation will reform the way consumers are responsible for reporting information about mortgage loans they have received. As consumers we need to give them more information, both to avoid similar mortgages and to avoid fraud. I have no doubt that many American consumers would be perfectly content if they could receive information about home loans they received, or indeed about the appraisals of houses they bought. I do not believe that is what the American consumer wants.  But the cost of reporting information is borne almost exclusively by taxpayers. While taxpayers may provide information to the IRS and others on loan type, income, and principal balances, consumers tend to only report information about loans received or purchased under favorable terms. For example, a mortgage may have been received at a low

It is something that I will speak to later as to how it might be addressed at this time on the issue of FISA.  CMDR Sheppard is still missing, and there may be a concern about that.

I hope for purposes of management that Senators on our side would leave it up to the Senator from New Mexico to make his case at some time after we have had that vote in order to allow people to speak on his amendment so we can make our statements after we have had the vote to make some indication as to how they might vote on the one we are about to accept. I am willing to leave it up to Senator Lott of Kansas or his designee to make that announcement to the American people. I am also hopeful that we will not have it just a matter of a few minutes before the vote. But I hope we would keep the announcement from about a minute before the vote to the fact that then we will be advised how that vote will be taken in terms of his specific proposal.

Mr. Chairman, I want to speak in opposition to the point of order raised against the amendment.  This amendment attempts to double the budget for defense spending, and it increases funding for the State Department by $3 billion over the next 5 years.  I support the Clinton administration position that these funds should be added to our national debt. My view is that if we do not do so now, the chairman's legislation is much more likely to be enacted than that passed in the Senate bill, and the additional spending will likely be in the form of new initiatives to address some of the problems facing this Nation as a result of the double-digit economic growth over the past 5 years.  In addition, as the chairman pointed out, the House bill would increase funding for the State Department by $3 billion over the next 5 years.

Mr. Chairman, I understand one of the objections to the Obey amendment will be that it violates the Budget Act and violates the Budget process. That is true. But I think if the majority is so concerned about that budget process being out of order, then they ought to come and offer the same kind of open-door-open-door-open-door amendment that was rejected by the House last year when the conference brought their budget back up to where it was before the last House vote on the budget. There is an old saying that there are only two things the old money wants to do to you on a bill and that is tax increase and spend more money on more projects.  We heard from some of the Members on the other side of the aisle last year that they were going to increase their taxes on home buyers, they

If I understand the gentleman correctly, this in the first instance allows the Secretary to take care of a couple of programs to be completed very quickly in which case the administration will have to go through another step here on what we know to be a very important issue for the President and for the people of this country. I think that is a very important issue that I think needs to be addressed because it is not the whole problem here, the fact that you had a number of loans that had been outstanding and in one instance not even a State or a local government

The Republican whip should be more informed about what is in his bill than the other side of the aisle because this is not a bill that deals with a new Government agency or a new Federal act. It has to do with the day-to-day operating of the government of the United States.  The point that the Republican whip is making is absolutely, categorically false. This bill does not cut the funding for the executive branch by 1 penny in 1995, and in fact, it does not even change any of the funding at all in this bill in 1995.

FEMA is saying that the standard they are using in 2005, and as I have stated over and over again in the context of the Katrina disaster bill, is in fact a last resort; it does not provide a set of regulations or anything that is guaranteed to be in place in 2006 and to meaningfully deal with what needs to be dealt with after that. They also say that in the third year of the effort to address this need that the President would submit the necessary level of relief so that the country can come back to normal fairly quickly. I would say to the Chair, where would you have that relief come from? From all of the disaster families that have been harmed and the pain that they have caused and the damage that they have caused?

I was duly impressed with the leadership demonstrated by the majority leader and the committee in moving a clean conference report to the House floor.  It is important for all Members to understand that I was one of the Democrats who opposed the conference report to the Iraq war authorization bill because it does not protect American forces and we should not return to a status quo in Iraq that allows the use of force to continue until Congress, the President and the American people have a plan that is both effective and has the support of the Iraqi people and the Iraqi government.  For the fourth time in the last 10 years, we are asking the United States and our allies to provide a strategy for the future of Iraq that will enable our troops to succeed in their missions in support of U.S.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], ranking member, for yielding me this time and for his leadership on this issue.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would reduce by $38 million the funding for the renewable fuels standard required by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the E-92 legislation. It will be the first time in history that Congress would have to cut funding for a program that was designed to promote safe transportation of essential fuels between the two States of Iowa and Wisconsin.  Many good things have been said about this E-92 legislation, such as the fact that it will reduce Federal greenhouse gas emissions by 31 percent by 2010 from the 2005 level. But there are some good things about the amendment. The amendment would reduce the funds for the Renewable Fuels Standard by $38 million from last year's level

This amendment would prohibit the Secretary of the Army and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force from purchasing new airframe replacement parts for the C-130 aircraft that are produced from parts that are made and supplied by the Canadian company Pratt & Whitney in Illinois. The amendment is in order as a consequence of last fall's audit that found that Pratt & Whitney is underreporting how much parts cost the Department of the Army and the Air Force and is not meeting the Department's certification requirements in contracts for replacement parts and other consumer-based work. It also concerns the Department of the Army and the Air Force since they are the recipients of millions of dollars in procurement funds and are able to spend the money the least amount possible

The best way to stop the budget from doing this is to go to full funding and start cutting spending now and using that as an excuse to make cuts and to be able to hold these programs in budget control under this conference report. It is also important to understand that we have before us not only the fact that the President's own budget would not be able to pass this Congress but it would not pass the Senate either.

For almost two decades now, President Bush has embarked on a policy of unprecedented executive overreach that seeks to radically change our Nation's energy policy and undermine the cornerstone of our Nation's economic and energy security. This administration has called for a policy change of the sort our country has not seen for decades. After 11 years of Bush policies that have failed to provide basic reform, I will vote for this bill to rebuild America's domestic energy infrastructure and to strengthen our domestic energy security by making much needed reforms in our energy policy.

The need for this legislation does not come as a surprise. Congress has long had the responsibility to review any arms sales to countries with which the United States is not friendly. Over the last several years we have been especially concerned about China and Russia receiving government assistance in violation of United States trade law.

In those years Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act in hopes of providing aid for the growers and the farmers in the Klamath Basin so they could provide water for their families and businesses. However that aid has not kept pace with economic growth and as the drought continues to worsen it is imperative that we develop a responsible and environmentally sound strategy to stabilize the water supply of the Klamath Basin.

Mr. President, I rise to respond to the President's remarks he made about a half billion dollars for border security programs that this administration is so reluctant to spend on the Department of Defense when our men and women in uniform have not yet been called up to defend the Nation.  As we hear in the debate today, the President of the United States is saying that he does not want to pay for the border wall that the House of Representatives is about to pass, which would cut over $100 billion from the Federal Government and cost the American people a half billion dollars in border security and the loss of 600,000 jobs in that same period of time.  This is the President of the United States to demand that this country spend $1.5 billion in the coming fiscal year to prepare for the threat of terrorism by adding 10 million more

I support him in trying to improve our relationship with Iraq in the long run but I think that we need to move to the Security Council and not leave it on a sort of bottomless barrel. I think the President could have reached out to the Iraqi people and said we are not going to sit here and let the Iraqi people keep the Iraqi Government on its toes and continue to play dead in defense of its

Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has agreed to unanimously approve this legislation to provide for the reestablishment of the Unit of the United States Postal Service on the grounds of the Capitol Grounds. This legislation is similar to a proposed resolution which the Senate approved on March 1 and which has also been reported by the Judiciary Committee and is before the House today. The House of Representatives has also been dealing with this issue, with the same conclusion and just as comprehensive resolution that is now before the House. We should all be very grateful that both Houses of Congress have now come together and reached a consensus on the issue of District of Columbia postal voting.

I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of the Stenholm-Smith amendment to require that the only means of providing assistance to those seeking employment in the State of Kansas are those primarily offered through an IHOP or a similar food processing operation. This would eliminate the direct payment that would otherwise be provided to the employee or the employer through an IHOP or similar food processing operation because that payment will be subject to state and local taxes. However, States are encouraged to develop an appropriate payment structure so that any worker eligible for tax-exempt assistance would be allowed to remain in the State of Kansas if that is the plan that is adopted.  In a recent letter, the group Bank Offset, which represents food processors in my State of Kansas and the public in general, strongly supports this amendment and they believe that States

Mr. Speaker, last Congress I introduced the only health reform legislation that truly had bipartisan support, House Resolution 1119. House Resolution 1119 represents the compromise on our Nation's health care system that Members of this House and the Senate agreed upon with compromise legislation in each other's States. The compromise text today, as introduced, falls far short of the appropriate level of congressional support for comprehensive health care reform.  The Healthy Forests and Environment Restoration Act of 1996 amends the Clean Air Act of 1990 to require companies to set aside a specific amount of wood from their property in order to provide needed sustainment to forests and drinking water sources, including water for drinking, irrigation and power plants. By providing a substantial incentive for the use of existing wood, the bill will encourage the utilization of wood products for efficient forest management and its production.

I have always believed that the nomination should be favorably reported to the Senate so that he can be confirmed by the Senate before a very difficult election year in this country. However, I think that it would be more appropriate to give the President the opportunity to have a full debate of this nomination before the Senate in the waning days before an election year, not to delay the Senate from doing its duty to the people of this country. The President should not have the opportunity to have a campaign that has all the country's most important issues in it and has asked for the support of 90 percent of the Senate in order to make that decision.

As the American people and America's allies in the region lost the hope and commitment to peace and the East China Sea by the Chinese Government and soldiers as the result of the Bataan death march which took place in October 1942, America used its military might to free the people of China from the yoke of Imperial Japan. From that time on, America has not only maintained a stand for the freedom of the people of China and the many different forms of national liberation struggles that we still enjoy today, but we have also offered great service and assistance to the people of those countries in liberating themselves and bringing about stability and

I would also like to thank the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] for their leadership on the bill and their continued support on the issues of higher education and financial aid. These Members have worked hard to bring this legislation to the floor. I would also like to thank the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Myers

Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Justice Lance Walker of Maine to the Supreme Court of the United States. I want to express my support for his service as a trial judge and to explain my disappointment in the lack of judicial courage in general and the Roberts nomination in particular.  I think the American people are greatly concerned by what we have seen from our distinguished former colleague Judge Walker, a man with a distinguished and brilliant career in the legal profession and appellate courts as well as the courts of the District of Columbia. His credentials and reputation are well-established by the record, and he should be able to move forward as the nation's next Chief Justice.  Judge Walker came to the bench in 1988 with a reputation as a competent trial judge and a judgment as fair and considerate as they come in our judicial system.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday it was reported that the pharmaceutical industries and HMO industries spent $141 million in Washington during the last year. But the reports also indicate that these industries are spending more on lobbying in Washington than they are on drug supply side reform. HMO, in particular, clearly continues to take advantage of the promise of H.R. 2848 to their groups, but this is not an area that can be reported to the President for action.  Last week in San Francisco, Congressman George Miller held a townhall with President Bush, and I want to commend Congressman Miller for his hard work on the prescription drug issue. It is unacceptable that at a time when we are bringing reform to our Nation's drug benefit that millions of Americans still do not have access to life-saving drugs, prescription drugs.

For over 30 years Congress has prohibited funds in this bill from being used to defend America against any foreign nation that would harm United States interests.  I would say to my colleague from Tennessee that when we consider this debate this morning, it is not because we do not recognize the right of all people, not only our fellow citizens, our citizens to organize, to form lawful associations, to seek justice, to seek assistance from the Government to help their fellow citizens.

Mr. President, I wish to clarify that this exception applies only when there are at least three other bodies represented by a majority that does not have the supermajority it would otherwise have but that is called a group of three that do not have a supermajority of either body. It does not necessarily mean that the Senate will have to act in that instance as well. It does not have to do with whether the bill is second-degree or first-degree in nature. The only thing that would suggest that the supermajority is required is the presence of a majority of the whole number of votes of the Members present, which would be three, and that is not necessarily a right that we are discussing here in the pending amendment. This is the only one of the three where it could not happen in the circumstances of this pending amendment. So

Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to discuss the harassment of whales and other marine mammals by the Japanese fishing industry.  As a member of the Merchant Marine Subcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard, I have closely examined the Japanese fishing industry.  A moratorium on whale harvesting was finally enacted in 1972 to end the reckless and inhumane practice of whales being slaughtered for a product called whale meat. As a result of the moratorium, fishing stocks have recovered to where they are a far cry from the 20 years that ended with the moratorium.  The United States Navy's Marine Mammal Commission has repeatedly warned Japan about the destructive impact of the consumption of whale meat and the marine mammals endangered by its consumption. I have worked with the Marine Mammal Commission to end the Japan whale-hunting industry, and today I introduced a bill, H.

Mr. President, I will support the Balance Budget Act of 1997 which takes us the next 5 years on our policy of deficit spending and cuts spending by 2 percent or more in every budget year until we get our fiscal house in order and become more prudent and responsible in our use of our government's resources and spending power in the future.  I am also concerned that this legislation may set the stage for further fiscal turmoil in our Federal Government. I have been one of the most persistent advocates of fiscal discipline in recent years, but I cannot in good conscience support this legislation. For there are a number of important reasons. First, as the Senate budget process began last week, there were Members of both parties expressing concern about the administration's proposal to bring up the continuing resolution, which would continue a government shutdown of Government services and increase the deficit

Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the Gingrich-Armey rule to kill the minimum wage. This rule has the potential to cut wages and raise prices for American workers and our children, and this is just a further example of the fact that this rule is a job killer and a big price to pay for a $200 billion tax increase.  The rule has also a cruel anticompetitive provision, which would force low- and middle-income American businesses to pay special tax rates to the Government and then to the employers that hire these employees. A recent study found that the additional tax burden imposed on American small businesses would have an ``empowering effect on business'' and ``define the cost of doing business,'' costing the taxpayers $17 billion per year.

Mr. Chairman, we have seen several attacks recently in the United States, resulting in 15 deaths and over 500 injured. One such attack occurred on the New York City subway system, which was carried out by a person who was inspired by the terrorist attacks in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Texas.  Terrorists have many weapons and very little fear of the law. They rely on drug trafficking, weapons, and bomb-making skills. They place the lives of those who try to stop them in great jeopardy.
