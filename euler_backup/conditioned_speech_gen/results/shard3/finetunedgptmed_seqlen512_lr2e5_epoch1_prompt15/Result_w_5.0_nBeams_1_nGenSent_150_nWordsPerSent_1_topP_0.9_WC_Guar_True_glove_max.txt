Mr. Speaker, candidate Clinton is President Clinton, in large respect because he showed he was a candidate who would work hard, not give in to the special interests or to the politics of Washington. President Clinton has raised the issue of Medicare and Medicaid for years and in the process of doing so has earned the respect of everyone he has come in contact with and has the support of the American people who believe that they need to have tax cuts in order to get tax cuts bill.  President Clinton has recognized that health care is a huge part of the new economy created by free trade and free enterprise in the 1970's. The American people understand that health care reform will help control costs, improve quality, increase health literacy and, ultimately, save lives. It will expand choice and bring much needed competition to our health care system.  The President has

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues' support for legislation I am introducing that would protect the environment and ensure that we invest in the technology that will enable us to eliminate the largest amount of our landfills and the most dangerous substances that they create while reducing the energy costs to consumers as well as companies and businesses.  The Drug and Chemical Impacts Conference report, H.R. 5359, would strengthen Federal law regarding the disposal of hazardous waste and lead paint containing dioxins and other hazardous materials. By replacing or downgrading outdated Toxic Substances Control Act regulations, H.R. 5359 allows States to be more assertive in using appropriate standards to ensure the safe and efficient disposal of hazardous materials.  H.R. 5359 is necessary because over the years this Congress has had access to no other

We want to pay tribute to those who have taken so much from the American people to support their own country's national defense and to support the government of Congress and this great Nation of ours.  Many times I think, although we do not hear about it, the people in my district around here think that the taxpayers in their district and across the country do not spend the money for veterans' benefits that they and their families provide.

We know that.  Now, as the President says, unless Congress approves a plan to leave, there will be no troops on American soil and that withdrawal would not occur.

These two actions have prevented the Senate from considering this conference report in a fair and responsible manner, and since they have prevented us from passing this bill in the past--again without any Republican participation--today is citizenship day in this Chamber.

Mr. President, we are now on the temporary extension of unemployment insurance benefits. This bill now before us provides a 6-month extension and we are going to be working very hard to get more assistance to those who need it. This includes helping those workers who work jobs that are vital to their communities, and working to help them with the needs of their families. The unemployment aid bill provides for a benefit that can be taken into effect immediately in every State.  For some time, we have been negotiating with the other body about a short-term extension. I hope they could accommodate this. But at this time, we are in the position where we have a limited number of other workers to take into consideration.  Therefore, we are going to have to do some work to accommodate those workers who may be here. So my friend from

Madam President, reserving the right to object, I think it is important to remember that we are not going to end this debate this evening and not have some debate on this important issue. But, in my view, we ought to at least proceed to that and go to our amendment process this evening. We need to do our due diligence in this effort to get what we believe should be done by this administration in our expectation of approval.  So I object.  The  clinging to the Interior budget rider is very telling of what a sham this fiscal and legislative process has been and will continue to be.  Mr. President, I call Mr. Leahy's attention to Secretary Alice Rivlin Madame Rivlin just said that our budget process was in desperate need of a revamp--really a complete revamp--in order to meet

It is a bill called the Health Security Improvement Act that is something that has not been taken up in many years because the Bush administration and the majority party in this House William Bennett blocked it. And that is that this law requires the establishment of a private health insurance plan that all Americans will have access to and is Catholic-sponsored by a government entity that will go to work with them to make sure they all have access to this system. And what it actually does is means that if you are a man or a woman, you can get health insurance if

Mr. President, on August 10, Fulton County Sheriff Deputy Troy Chisum should be turning 40 years old. Fulton County Sheriff Deputy Troy Chisum is not only a great American who did so much to public safety during his 25 years of law enforcement service and who served Illinois and his Nation honorably during his 22-year career of dedication to the people of Fulton County and all across America, but he is a husband and father.  Mr. Chisum grew up in Amandaville and currently resides in Genesee, MN. In 1981, he began his career as a sworn law enforcement officer. He began to enjoy more freedom, self-reliance, and independence as a father and grandfather, and I do not think he was ever fazed by or surprised by the challenges he had to face. In 2006, Chief Henry K

Now, let's talk about this Brazilian cotton, and let me tell you, if I were you, I would say that is a little bit of a not good deal for the consumer because they will be spending more money on those kinds of things that they pay for when they buy that same bill here in the United States that they will pay for the same product here in the United States because it will be either signed by that same government that would be agreed to over in Brazil because that government will agree to the payment of interest and the penalties for disputes.  It is right on the United States, so if they say, ``I'm going to pay interest, or penalties and interest,'' they will be paying interest, so that is what this will do. That is why we must protect it because it could end up costing so much money.

Last year, the White House insisted that the law would not cause any serious problems for individuals and that the law does not increase the number of crimes or charges that must be filed with State or Federal authorities.

The Energy and Natural Resources Committee has reported in a bipartisan manner--not one Republican--30 bills since September--one after another--that have to do with energy.  For 30 days in September, they were talking about oil and how we could get to a stable price for oil. They wouldn't stop. They have now come to the floor of the Senate and want to say: Wait a minute.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, last July, President Bush gave the order to start the conference of the Pacific Rim for the purpose of the annual State of the Union address to the American public on climate change and to work to reduce the impact of climate change on our Nation's economy and the resources it provides for all Americans.  Those funds were raised from the sale of the Exxon corporation's bonds to the Federal Government in the form of tax breaks to the industry flood control insurance industry and the wind farm industry. These are major industries that, during the Obama administration, were able to obtain tax breaks totaling $100 billion. These are the industries that, when the private sector is unable to do business because of an inability to obtain tax breaks, employ large numbers of Americans, particularly among minority- and

What the House has done is to ensure that compliance with the rules and quotas will only be awarded to IRS employees who have demonstrated such contempt for the IRS.  We have seen numerous examples of these employees treating taxpayers. Two examples: a guard who exposed 5,000 taxpayer documents to his supervisors in violation of IRS ethics policy, then applied to the employee association for compensation, and another who actually hired a thief to steal out millions from the IRS during the next tax season.

To do so would mean increasing the Federal budget for education in America and would also require States to spend more on homeland security. These are terrible ideas that endanger the lives and safety of Americans who are not prepared to be far removed from our border. We should be giving our highly capable and highly trained DHS officials accurate information so they can correct inaccurate reports and develop necessary strategies.  The ACLU's most recent report reveals that the DOJ's statistics on the heightened risk of terrorism are based on information which is shaky. In fact, DHS has provided inconsistent and conflicting information, which now need to be scrutinized. I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill

limits loan farmers 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill that imposes meaningful farm payment limitations. I am particularly pleased that I am joined today by Agriculture Committee chairman and my good friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici.  Farmers often are asked, ``Why should I bother to purchase my fruits and vegetables if my income is so low that I can't make it on loan from the Federal Government?'' Simply put, farm payments make up one-fifth of the Federal budget. That is because all Federal payments come directly to farmers and their families through the Federal Government limits and practices. However, the reality is that many farmers are not informed and not properly educated about the value of their crop products or how their Federal payments will be treated.  Thus, the best way to keep up with the value of a product is to understand it is

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the bi-partisan amendment sponsored by my good friend and colleague, the subcommittee ranking member, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), to the conference report on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2006.  The agency that needs the most attention in the supplemental appropriations bill is the Reserve components, which account for about 20 percent of the total Department of Defense budget. We need to keep pace with the reality of the global presence of our uniformed forces, as the Department of Defense is forced to continually retool its industrial base and downsize their procurement process.  While we could well be facing a 5-year budget cycle, I know that the chairman and I, as chairmen of the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, can improve our agency's short-

That was in the Finance Committee report on the President remarks that he made this week on that subject that he made comments about executive pay.  And I don't know if the fact that the Democratic leader of the Senate said after his visit with Senator Dodd and others, he has not, I believe, asked for that appointment, is that not what

Yes, the gentleman is correct. School food authorities must have maximum flexibility to plan menus in an appropriate manner to meet the needs of specific food types and consumer needs. For example, food categories such as fish or meat may include some reduced cost item to complete the target meal or require it to be accompanied by other items at no additional cost to the consumer. Therefore, this flexibility would need to be used to correct what we see in many of our schools and communities as a result of changes to Federal dietary guidance regulations. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The budget deal reflects the expectations of the American people about what a better budget would mean to the American people and cuts Federal spending in half in 7 years compared to the rate of increase from 2000 to 2007 for almost every account in the Federal budget including the overall budget and for every account in the percent of total budget.  The budget deal will save money and better control spending. The commitment to end taxpayer-funded pork Thanksgiving is one of the most important and significant accomplishments of this new majority.  The budget agreement also rejects the misguided and inequitable tax plan that the majority in this House decided last month to approve. This tax increase makes clear that Congress and the President support limiting individual and corporate tax deductions

california yielding gas 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time. I rise today in support of this legislation to provide an economic stimulus package to help California producers and consumers. We need to continue our efforts to help this economy recover from its deepest recession in nearly 25 years and help small businesses keep their doors open so they can grow and create jobs in the future. Gas prices have risen to unprecedented highs. When we take a look at the cost of energy, it is clear that California has been hit hard by higher energy prices yielding added hardships to families. A 1.3 percent drop in the price of gasoline by the end of the year would cost taxpayers as much as $200 million in the State of California alone.  I am not arguing that gas prices are high for the average Californian. But we need to reduce the price of

Mr. President, just a few hours ago, President Clinton delivered his 5-year balanced budget to Congress. He did not make the balanced budget proposal part of his State of the Union speech, but he does believe we should do that because the economy is in a tough time, the economy is in an even tougher time than he said it was when he signed that budget proposal. Clinton laid out a proposal for how we might get out of the recession, how we might provide some relief for the people who need the assistance the most--our Nation's middle-class families, and our families--and it is called the Clinton proposal.  Some Republican Senators, including those I represent in the Senate, have pressed for a stronger Republican response. We have worked with Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts on a number of areas of this budget proposal. We did discuss the

That is a very simple concept. But as I promised the Democratic leaders and the administration on reform, as I pledged to the President, this funding bill does not guarantee that Ukraine will be able to fully fund its basic security needs.  This funding bill provides funding for the 100-day extension of the debt limit, which, as the Senate Budget Committee has already noted, is not needed to meet Ukraine's obligations under the human rights agreements that have been entered into between the United States and Ukraine.

experience disabilities disability 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, more than 37 million people in the United States have a disability, including more than 15 million children and a staggering 1 in 12 children having disabilities. This disability is not unique to this country but it is far too common and a growing public health problem in our country and in much of our world. Many of those people experience barriers in the workplace. These barriers may include inadequate wheelchair space, a loss of mobility, or lack of accessible transportation. Despite the challenges faced by disabled individuals, few if any have the opportunity to obtain affordable health care that would provide the necessary mobility and quality of life improvements, such as safe, accessible and regular physical activities and medications that provide protection against illness and prevent diseases.  Disability is a barrier to employment, and employers in this country are also subject to that barrier. In the most recent survey

Congress and the American people have the right to determine how the evidence of the September 11 attacks will be handled by the Federal Government and to the United States Government in the future. America is one of the most important and world-famous nations in the world and Mexico is its largest trading partner. More than 20 million Mexicans live in the United States.  The United States had strong ties to the Republic of Mexico and its territories in the days following the September 11 attacks, a strong bond

We made a determination that at this time for fiscal year 1996 the administration was providing the maximum authorization that they could with a 10 percent decrease in the budget request, but there was no way that our budget would permit a 10 percent reduction in the appropriation, and we are left with, frankly, 12 percent in this year's appropriation of the VA budget.

But his record should be enough to disqualify him from a postjudge bench position.  Judge Manson is so old he has now retired from service and Leslie Frewer, the widow of the late California assemblywoman Marianne ``Mona'' Frewer, just announced that he will soon retires from the bench. Leslie Fayner Manson will depose Judge Manson this week and Leslie Fayner Manson Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley Shirley southwick

Mr. Chairman, as we draw to a close today in the Congress of the United States we are voting on important issues such as health care for our senior citizens and veterans affairs programs. I have some great respect and admiration for those of you that are trying to ensure quality health care for all of our veterans. I would like to focus just a couple of comments on the issue of veterans' health care.  I have had the privilege of knowing a number of the veterans and their families. I can assure you that I have stood at those veterans' cemeteries and seen the energy in those cemeteries; that the number one priority for them has been to give us the best possible health care for their grandchildren, for their children, for their parents, for their spouses,

As you know, I do not support increasing the defense budget. This budget preference system is not working. I support eliminating it.  The defense budget is $832 billion. The defense budget is equal to the total total budget for 1996, the latest year for which this budget, the Defense authorization bill, has been furnished to me.

Mr. Speaker, over a million Americans, including 200,000 young Americans, are living with type 1 diabetes and nearly all of them are children. Unfortunately, today we are having an opportunity to do something important in health research by passing the Diabetes Research Enhancement Act, also known as the Do Kids Count Act.  If we allow for additional research funding from multiple federal sources, diabetes research will gain great insight into how diabetes affects the glucose metabolism of children.  This research also could inform how we might improve the practice of diet, the prevention and treatment of diabetes, and the prevention of the growth of type 1 diabetes, thereby assisting in the fight against this disease.  For instance, this bill would establish a grant program to expand treatment and prevention efforts for type 1 diabetes.

I also thank the Senator. Let me just give one quick example of what I think is an important part of the Senator's remarks today. If he is to read that President Clinton says the Senate has no business having any new legislation to close tax loopholes for the top 1 percent or anyone else--I think he does it in a thoughtful way on this bill and I don't think I want to get back pharmacists and nurse practitioners and everything else out of the picture--I wonder if he can hear me when I say I do not think you can do that by Tom Lantos and Leon Panetta, two extraordinarily brilliant Senators. I cannot believe in what they are saying. I say to the Senator from Illinois, who is probably watching this very closely, he is listening carefully to what I am saying. It is such a waste

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and Senator Smith on the bipartisan legislation to repeal the data retention provision in the Federal Communications Commission order as reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on May 10, 2006.  Data tracking is an effective tool to assist law enforcement officials in tracking criminal offenders, save taxpayers time and money, and keep offenders off the street. The removal of this data provision from the Federal Communications Commission order will permit this important tracking tool.  This information helps law enforcement authorities with various criminal activities to identify and stop criminal activities and investigations before they become more detrimental to the public. The Postal Service and Federal Communications Commission conducted comprehensive data collection programs in an effort to carry out all aspects of the law enforcement effort. Without this data the Federal Communications Commission will be unable to use it

Congress considered and passed a number of amendments to address this problem. One proposal was to hold a mandatory conference with the States on the subject of uniform State excise taxes. I am pleased to report that at a Senate Committee on Finance markup of the State/Tribal Revenue Security Act, the Finance Committee passed the legislation.

political budget republicans

Mr. Speaker, I draw your attention to this particular chart here. As of today, it shows that over $12 trillion in taxpayer dollars and $1 trillion of future tax revenue has been spent by the United States of America on interest on our budget deficit and Social Security and Medicare and veterans health care programs which Republicans and Democrats have put together in a bill that we are voting on today and this weekend. This is political theater, because all of the hard work of working families, the middle-income families who put all of their hard-earned money in Government-run investment accounts, at no cost to them in terms of their efforts to put it toward their children's education, no cost to them in terms of their efforts to put it toward their children's health care and their pensions, in terms of those programs and services which they use,

corporate president act 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the second in this series of bills is the Corporate Tax Equity Act, legislation that would remove corporate tax barriers that keep companies from complying with the Tax Code as required by law and act to expand the President's creation of an international tax uniformity commission to help reduce tax avoidance and tax fraud. This bill is identical to an amendment offered by Senator Lieberman last Congress, which was supported by a bipartisan group of 40 Senators, and it was accepted.  The measure we are considering today is similar to the amendment introduced last Congress by Senator Vitter, whose legislation to fully repeal the estate tax would have been included in the bill before us today. Senator Vitter's bill would have called on the President to issue an executive order or memorandum to further help eliminate or reduce corporate tax avoidance. This measure would have provided that the President's

halfway legislation whip

Mr. Chairman, if we are going to maintain the express advocacy standard championed by the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] and others on this side of the aisle, we should permit legislation to enter into the legislative process which seeks to extend those preemption and parallel jurisdiction which it enacts over one set of problems to another set of problems just to reach a halfway point in the legislative process.  I want to be sure in the analysis of any legislation before us that we understand it to be much broader than that, so if we do pass legislation which whip back a previously existing preemption, we should consider it to be extending it for all or at least the very limited purpose of expanding or even preempting State preemption in one area or another.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I believe that they have made a good start to working on this legislation and in bringing to the floor the managers bill that will be the basis of its enactment into law in 1997. As such, I rise in strong support of this important legislation and would encourage the managers to increase the votes in this measure in order to pass this important legislation today.  As Senator Lott mentioned in his opening statement, the Arkansas State Land Conservation Commission (ASLC) has served as a great resource to Arkansas and the State of Mississippi.

The base prices for milk from the States of California, Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Idaho, and from the large producer dairy operations in Utah, New Mexico, and Colorado, have been fixed to reflect market factors and have increased from $8.85 per bushel (45 percent increase) in 1992 to $15.84 per bushel (75 percent increase) in 1995. These new prices were imposed by the Federal Government in 1992.  In 1993,

I do not want to preclude that in the future, and I hope that the House of Representatives will agree to that agreement in this legislation.  I think there was a philosophical disagreement on that point. In the previous amendment, there was a 2.5-percent levy on gas taxes to fund these public utility services. There are some others to fund, but those are where the two votes were placed. I believe that would

So we are saying there should be a tax bill Speaker Pelosi has put forward which is essentially the same as the Medicare bill that she says has a crisis in its private coverage of hospitals, doctors, and what are called primary care physicians, the hospitals and the doctors.

There was that suggestion in the Committee on Rules that this was somehow an curious process which the Senator from Missouri might not be happy with that my State was subject to that.

They are allowed to charge because they do not charge for out-of-hospital care. However, this is as far as Medicaid being able to collect costs. They are allowed to charge for the expenses. In other words, States are not allowed to charge for the out-of-hospital care. The idea that if this bill goes through in the Senate that it would be a disaster, the House is not going to be able to go through the Senate with a whole bunch of those bills, a whole lot of additional things, and they will try to obstruct us

Mr. Chairman, I want to preface my remarks by two things: number one, not all of the oil we have in the gulf area is good for America's economy; that is not the whole picture, and number two, Chairman Upton's performance here today and his statement is very instructive.  We are all very upset about the effect of this policy on our State and local economies and on our energy security.  Unfortunately, and I know this is the gentleman's opinion, we are entering a time when we all know there is a gaping hole in our domestic energy and energy security. We have to figure out what is in the American economy. We need to understand where those resources are located and what that country of origin and what that country needs to be to be good stewards of its resources.  Now, of course, some of

We should be required to ensure that we have some funding for Federal Government agencies so that there is a certain level of oversight and accountability so that there is a public accountability and Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank can assure the American people that we have the resources to do the work that they expect of us. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to resolve this issue and to ensure that there are additional resources available to be spent efficiently and equitably

Cynthia Woods was a proud member of the family that created the Toombs Run, a family-owned charter sailboat that has operated off the coast of Texas for the last 15 years. A student of both the Wright Brothers and of sailing, Cynthia Woods was president of the Toombs Run's Board of Directors.  The recent events of Cynthia Woods will never be forgotten by the overwhelming majority of the sailors, the friends, and family of that great vessel.

That is what this is all about.

Let me say a few words on what President Clinton and Republicans in Congress are trying to do as part of their effort to reach this deal and to end the war in Iraq and the criminal act which has been committed by those who have led the country there for the last 17 years, the Bush administration and the Republican Congress of the last Congress that has continued the policies which the Federal Government has pursued, as President Bush stated in his August 13, 1996 speech, when he said: While I would prefer to conclude this war with fewer Americans dead, it would be a greater tragedy to lose the cause of freedom and democracy if this plan to end this war failed. I think President Clinton's speech was a real cause

Mr. Speaker, I too would like to thank the chairman and encourage passage of this measure. This legislation will provide much-needed regulatory relief for the people of the United States in their attempt to curb illegal immigration and ensure that all citizens of the United States receive the most basic of rights and freedoms of life and liberty. Passage of this bill will also assure that our Nation will continue to be a leader in Asia and the Pacific region and will promote the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs' desire to increase military strength in that region.  This measure also provides billions of dollars to our Nation's education programs and the training of our National Guard and Reserve.  Finally, this measure should be noted that its provisions do not address the issues of legal immigration or the sanctity of civil rights and human rights, but only address what amounts to fraud and

Under our provisions, when a wounded, sick or disabled veteran returns to the United States, he will have a referral from the military to a private medical practitioner who may examine him and determine if any of the following requirements are met:  A treatment plan will be developed by the private practitioner for a period not to exceed 10 days, with the final report, signed by the private practitioner, on how to provide care to the veteran. The report will state the reasons for the physician's diagnosis of a case of traumatic brain injury and he

When that has not happened then it has been strongly objected to by the Senators who had no intent to make any kind of cut to this important Federal program as well as by the child welfare Act.  Mr. President, what the Senator from Massachusetts has said is certainly correct. I want to comment on a few aspects of that. I do not want to make my point very often, but the basic point is that any significant reductions in the children's program are going to

What has been the impact of this upon local officials and the general public? Chief among the problems is a tax bill that is pushing major road construction projects into communities that are not developed to traffic.  It was clearly stated that Ellison's amendment would not affect taxpayers in Minnesota nor would it impair any road construction projects in Illinois. However, I must emphasize that the new exemption would probably create more jobs and help keep pace with the so-called ``Middle Class Tax'' of roads and bridges

That was February 2002 December when the Democrat majority in the House of Representatives and President Bush put their signature jobs bill on the floor.  I know how hard families are working to help us achieve job creation in this economy and I don't think they would have liked to see a Democrat President sign this bill with a Democratic-controlled House and Senate.

Since the President's budget included a drastic new tax cut, we want to get rid of all of the phoney tax cuts that come with them. By increasing the deduction for interest on Federal student loans, we can help seniors make more conservative choices.  Current law allows high-income individuals to deduct their interest on federal student loans. This deduction for federal student loans is carried forward as a credit toward paying down their student debt in higher education. If you elect to leave school with tax-free tuition, your employer can capitalize the increased interest income on their Federal student loans into a qualified business expense for tax purposes.

Mr. President, I want to compliment the distinguished Senator from Nebraska on his tremendous work on the budget bill, Senator Harkin's work as the chairman of the Budget Committee, and the work of all the members of the HELP Committee as well as the staff of both the HELP Committee and the other body who did the work of making that a very fine product and who were all involved in getting the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security trained in these great technical fields.  This is a 4-year piece of legislation and we really hope it does not get out of the way before it has a chance to work its way through the Congress, but nonetheless, I just wanted to give a big bang to the work of the Senator from Nebraska on this measure.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a proposal that has been offered on the floor of the Senate and by my good friend from California, Senator Feinstein. That is what I want to address at this time and would like to make a few comments on it before I received the entire statement from the sponsor of this bill and look at what it is all about.  Senator Feinstein is proposing to tax the cost of investing taxpayers' money in a company in a reasonable manner, something the general public will be able to evaluate and weigh.  Why is this such a good idea? Senator Feinstein is proposing to tax an individual company's profits as a percentage of the company's earnings. It is reasonable, indeed. Since every penny of the U.S. corporate sector today comes with a capital gains tax of at least 10 percent,

I hope my colleagues will support this amendment to get the sense out there about why we need to do what we do today. I know we need cry-bagging amendments, but this one deserves its own cry-bagging.   spec hue hue, spec hue.

This important measure is important in improving the quality of health care access, cost sharing, and quality of care for working families.  There is growing concern in this body and in Washington, DC, that--as many States have, unfortunately--children, elderly, and disabled Americans will be forced to pay more for health insurance plans if they change jobs. Health insurance reform legislation will promote choice, promote personal responsibility, and encourage competition. If these provisions are implemented properly, this legislation will improve quality and lower the cost of health insurance.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I would like to commend Senator Isakson and Senator Hatch for working with me on this committee-reported measure and have so much confidence that it will pass both bodies with the support of the American people. And I think it is a standard Congress is recognizing on National Individual Affordability Week.  Mr. Speaker, nearly 45 million Americans work full time in one way or another, and 45 million of those individuals are families. More than 10 million American workers are covered by employer plans, and these plans cover only a few percent of those workers, but many Americans' benefits are tightly regulated by their employers.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support a provision in the American Overseas Interests Act, which I have cosponsored with Congresswoman DeLauro and will support in this body with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as well. This provision would permit the State Department to use this arms control loophole to circumvent U.S. law and allow U.S. military personnel to enter Saudi Arabia to participate in programs that may be seriously adverse to the United States.  The State Department's interpretation of international humanitarian law includes an attempt to subject U.S. military personnel to the law. It would allow them to act as if they were armed by virtue of entry into the country. This notion has been brought to the attention of the State Department and the Department of Justice, and the matter has been referred to the Special Counsel's

But in the last several months we have had to come to some understandings as to how we could bring out the best we can from this place on a national level in order to keep our competitive edge in the international marketplace for our foreign policy. That is what President Bush's approach is going to be in negotiating those very important and very limited objectives that we have in the current effort. It is hard for those of us ineffective as Senators to focus on getting our priorities together. This is one we are going to have to take very seriously and, frankly, reach out and do our best to accomplish, because it is very difficult to do when the odds are stacked against

The deficit isn't just happening in our schools or our streets or other important areas, and frankly, the deficit is because of past management that was not sound, and that must be corrected, and this Congress has to do the right thing.

This year is also the year when the President will rise to speak about a new Presidential commission to review a whole host of Department of Defense issues that have come to light during recent hearings in this body.  I am prepared to discuss the transcript of his speech on April 19 of this year. If the President does so, he should use it to bolster his credentials as a citizen of the free world and to defend the principle of all Americans having a good government, and, in fact, a free press, and certainly of a free press which I hear, in the event that the President is concerned,

In the case of his distinguished statement, as I am sure he has read it and seen it, I would strongly urge the President to send a message to the Congress of the United States that this Nation is once again engaged in a war, that the total war budget of the United States is somewhere over $800 billion. That is on a per capita basis for the number of men and women who are in uniform.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to address what I call the tale of two Kings, of service and one failure in our effort to reform welfare. Today in this body the Congress has once again failed to address the issues of choice and growing dependence on government handouts to the families we represent by continuing to rise in the wrong direction on the issue of how to help families gain economic self-sufficiency. This failure is not just a failure for our Nation as a whole but also for those whose words we rely on to ask for the help we so desperately need.  While this resolution does not address the issue of reducing the size of the government, it does commend the President for his efforts to tackle the long-term problems of poverty that have resulted from increasing entitlement spending, and for supporting state efforts to control spending and provide incentives for greater

The Department of Defense and its continuing investments in critical programs that help fuel our country's economic growth and defense capabilities are debtors to the American taxpayer. But this is not an issue exclusively focused on the Defense Department. It is important to note that other programs from the Department of Defense are funded at a level or higher than that of the rest of the Federal Government, which includes the Veterans Health Administration, the Centers for Disease Control, and other vital health care services.

I also sought and received the Congressional Gold Medal in the House of Representatives for this legislation.  In the 2008 Affordable Care Act for Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 2009 we were given greater access to health care and increased availability of insurance for millions of Americans. However, we also sought to expand Federal medical liability protection and the creation of a Medicare Advantage demonstration project for low-income individuals and families, and we adopted several costly reforms that greatly increased the cost of care for American families and seniors.  In the 100th Congress, we will take our jobs back from the insurance industry to achieve a healthier and more affordable health care reform, but

This will actually direct the Congressional Budget Office to try and estimate what this would mean for Medicare and the Federal budget. If we allow reasonable cuts, it will save $200 billion a year and maybe as much as a $2 billion a year in additional Medicare costs. This is a saving we will support, and it makes a lot of sense. We also urge our colleagues to support this amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

reported industries drug

Mr. Speaker, yesterday it was reported that the pharmaceutical industries and HMO industries spent $141 million lobbying Congress in the last two Congresses to keep prescription drugs off the public market, something that has occurred many times in the last 10 years.  According to reports from the Federal Trade Commission, the pharmaceutical industry spent over $24 billion lobbying Congress in 1996. How much did the pharmaceutical industry spend lobbying Congress in 1997? In March of that same month, it is estimated that the pharmaceutical industry spent $36 billion lobbying Congress.  The fact is that prescription drug manufacturers spend more than half a billion dollars per year on lobbying to increase their profits. To be sure, the costs are minimal and the market has plenty of competitive areas, but certainly they do raise the standards that need to be met in the marketplace.  In my State of Illinois,

Apparently, the Chair believes that that is not the amendment that was being debated. That is not the case here. I know this because I have been on this committee and I have taken time to talk to Members on both sides of the aisle and on the Appropriations Committee as well as our subcommittee chairman and our ranking member of the Appropriations Committee on a subject of importance to the economy in terms of jobs and whether we need to do more to create good jobs.  Here in Washington, I have had members of my office come to me and say they don't want to be held accountable for the actions of Members. Members are not held accountable. It is not something that is being conducted here.  You have it in front of you. The Chair has a lot of flexibility in terms of what he believes the committee should do in the future

Mr. Speaker, what will it take? What will it take for this body to finally sit down with the American people and come up with a plan that actually works for them and that our small businesses can thrive in the 21st century? That is the real question that the American people are asking on a regular basis in Colorado.  For years, we have argued about whether Federal subsidies are a good thing for farmers and small businesses in Colorado and Idaho, but Republicans continue to push legislation that will hurt NRA members, it will hurt small businesses, it will hurt the environment, it will hurt the veterans. So what is their solution?  In one of their first votes, they tried to repeal the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment that was passed just 2 weeks ago. With this legislation, the Republicans cut the minimum wage by $

wage increase american 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose the Gingrich-Armey rule to kill the minimum wage. This rule allows corporations to pay more in taxes than American workers earn in wages and salaries in the current $4.25 an hour minimum wage that our workers receive, yet the majority continues to push to increase taxes on hardworking American families.  Under this rule, the Republican majority would delay and undermine minimum wage protection that is guaranteed to workers by the laws of our Nation's Capital, the most expensive, and one of the most effective poverty measures in the Nation's history.  The rule also weakens the National Labor Relations Act to guarantee that no employee or worker collective bargaining authority in the United States will be preempted, but the Republican majority continues to provide unions with permission to pursue a frivolous and just cause to strike.  Every day, workers are squeezed

If that bill solved that one thing, if it just said to the average American that they can do their job under health insurance reform, as Senator Graham has pointed out, the Senator said that Republicans and Democrats had our differences on health care. Well, the point is they came together on a bipartisan basis in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the Founding Fathers did not write health care as a system that was for the American people but wrote it for the journal business of people and corporations.  The President did have some specific health insurance benefits, but there was no legislation that said the average American could not have health insurance if they liked it, provided that it was insured, and the bill that was signed into law by President Bush, A-101, a little 3-page paper, will start to pay a premium for health
