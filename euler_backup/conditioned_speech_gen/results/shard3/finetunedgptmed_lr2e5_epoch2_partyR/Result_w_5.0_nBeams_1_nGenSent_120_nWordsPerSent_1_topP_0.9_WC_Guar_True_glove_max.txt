Sometimes it is not easy to become fully involved in a great company. It takes great courage.

In this important bill and in this energy issue it is not the technology that is going to set the program back to 2008 but rather it is how we fund the money that will be used to build the new reactors.  In the past decade Congress has spent billions of dollars on short-term, off-the-shelf nuclear technology. With this money, for example, we have spent $5.8

One is still in progress, the other is complete.  The very first congressional investigation, which I was not privileged to have the privilege of chairing, was conducted by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona.

We are faced with a terrorist state, and we have to put the front-line American warriors back in the line of fire and that includes Detroit police and public safety officers. That means good, strong, law-abiding Michigan citizens.  I believe that our local governments have the most to fear from this enemy, not Iran, not North Korea, not the Cuban government, not the Chinese government,

Mr. Speaker, today in my district in California some 11 colleges and universities are celebrating the School of the Future program and their efforts to make education a reality for the next generation of students. This year is National College Access Day because Speaker Pelosi recently announced that more than a dozen of the 16 States that have had the School of the Future grant program in place over the last several years will block grant funds from going to block grant colleges. The states only fund over 30 percent of the tuition and other costs for higher education.  With that said, I encourage the rest of the country to send this money back to these

Mr. President, ObamaCare's costly new bureaucracy is the fifth largest government in history.  Despite its name, it spends far more per employee than all the bureaucracies run by the Federal Government.  ObamaCare will leave 50 million American families worse off than they were when they got ObamaCare, and it will strip 7.7 million from their jobs.

cost memorandum fuel

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time to make the case for this amendment which includes cost savings over the next 5 years for the Department of Energy. It is very basic in its approach that it would reduce fuel efficiency by 10 percent below the present level by the year 2003.  Let me explain the rationale for this memorandum of understanding. It was thought that by that year 2008, the cost of purchasing gasoline at the pump will be 7\1/2\ cents a gallon.  First of all, I want to make clear that this bill does not aim to cost the American taxpayer any

Since 1996, we have seen an unprecedented rise in the number of pro-life groups operating and recruiting against an amendment to the Constitution to make this point.

It has my strong support, and I urge Members to vote for it. It increases the legal voting rights of caucus members, reduces the penalties for crimes such as disorderly conduct, and provides for concurrent representation to a grand jury for conspiracy cases.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the first amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich). This amendment is a

In the past year alone the Federal Government has taken hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars and used them for specific types of wasteful spending. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has proven to be a very efficient taxpayer by deciding not to challenge their own rules. Now the Federal Government thinks the taxpayer should have some say as well.  Once a senior attorney at the U.S. Tax Court, one of my constitutional duties is to interpret our tax laws for the benefit of the

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of this good bill. It will do a great deal to help the Federal Government deal with the administration of justice in our country. It will do that by opening the government up to new and further reform proposals that will be put forward by Members of Congress that will deal with this plan, so that this Congress, and this President, will actually know what the alternatives are that are before them.  For this reason I want to address a couple of points made today by my good friend from New York.  First of

Madam Chairman, I want to begin by saying that the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York strikes the correct balance for America's medical system.  That said, let's not jump to our logical conclusion here. No medical clinic should ever be turned over to a profit-making financial institution and no medical provider should ever be turned over to a profit-making financial institution. That's why we must uphold the antifraud provisions contained in our bill, whether it's the Medical Liability Fairness Act, the Safety Net for Indigent Patients Act, or the Privacy Shield Act. And that's why this

It means the people of the United States of America have the right to have that Nation's arms. That is the premise of the United States Constitution. This amendment says the individual, the State, the local government, the citizenry, the individual, is the legitimate purchaser and manufacturer of firearms. It is the ``right

It is fitting to recognize the gentleman from New York (Mr. Owens), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and his distinguished staff, not only as many of you may know, but also because it is on its 40th anniversary.  As our colleague from Arizona (Mr. Flake) said, it has been the joy of the Speaker

It was during this hearing that I had the opportunity to talk with Army Specialist Shawn Wentworth and others from the South Dakota Army National Guard who suffered a terrible tragedy at Fort Drum earlier this year. It was just such a tragedy that these citizens were victims of outrage by those who did not have a vision of their goals and their ideals.  Soldier Wentworth and his fellow guardsmen were moved to tears at a memorial service that was

The policy provides that cable systems of public utilities or municipal governments are certainly legitimate business entities and can legitimately be cynical about the cost-effective and competitive financing opportunities available. The business entity can only be considered ``small business'' if, at the time of its creation, no other cable systems or telecommunications systems are available.

national support today

Mr. Chair, I have some concern that this is an expanded government program. This is the national post office and the Congress has been very explicit in saying it does not go beyond this program to the local post office that needs support. If we do that here and now today, we are going to get us to the end of the century where we are taking taxpayer money from our young, old, and needy young people, and we are not going to do anything to fix that.  The gentleman from Texas is correct, there are several programs such as McKinney-Vento that are involved in this.

To this day that date has not been used in the Chinese timetable because it is a Saturday.  The first reason to use this date is that many people in this body do not think this is necessary.

Mr. Chairman, the Coast Guard and Coast Guard National Guard is an important national security priority for this Congress and for future generations of Americans. I rise to support this budget request to maintain and improve this critical homeland security mission.  The amendment addresses several well-established deficiencies, and some of them are well-known to the Coast Guard. The amendment focuses on the Navy's consolidation of the Reserve Component Support Group into its full regional force. This consolidation will assist in the recruitment, retention, and training of more men and women to fill individual readiness gap as we prepare to field a new permanent fleet of nuclear powered submarines

He was offered a full scholarship to Harvard University in 1963 to attend, but declined this offer.  President Bush received his bachelor of law degree

That is why he feels the President has some leeway and he has had a mayor's company out there.  The President has consulted with the distinguished leadership of his administration. They did not anticipate this sort of situation and thought that by continuing to withdraw their advice, it would cause this sort of thing to happen. But they realized it was much more serious

These costs are eating away at small businesses that depend on foreign oil imports to consume fuel that we need to do our jobs. Now that we are actually balancing our budget, it is only natural that these concerns will affect everyone from our Nation's small recognizes to our Nation's largest oil companies.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, this will not be the last time energy prices impact every business in America. Earlier this year, for example, the White House released a study

There has been a great deal of media attention focused on this event and the accompanying media campaign surrounding the news conference that followed that press conference. Both urban and rural China have developed strict laws and have developed official media campaigns to prevent journalists from working on foreign affairs issues. These restrictions on media freedom have far-reaching implications and promote censorship and muzzling of journalists in China. A press freedom event in Beijing will test the willingness of the Chinese leadership to embrace freedom of

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I have a few questions about the piece of legislation that the Committee on Rules has just adopted to ensure the maintenance of public lands in the agricultural sector of this Nation. And that is really the subject of the reason I have this amendment in the bill today. It is to ensure that all of the corporate welfare that the current allocation of taxpayer subsidies makes possible will not continue to continue to consume taxpayer dollars.  I would ask the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen) if he could elaborate on the extent to which taxpayer subsidies impact the food safety, safety, and environmental systems of our Nation.

As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have consistently advocated that the Congress be the ultimate authority in authorizing Federal projects.

The last Congress proposed this important legislation and I have been pushing for this issue for as long as I can remember as an Alabama senior Senator as well as as as a negotiation and compromise between the House and the Senate for the past 8 years and the President has not been referred to this bill until now. I hope he will be one of the many Members who votes for the constitutional amendment before us today.  This is one issue that will dramatically alter the entire health care debate

They would have been very much on the right track here to see that the money was spent on the right place and the last Saturday at the Securities and Exchange Commission was a particularly solid week.

He asked how did we do that so they could ignore the reluctant unwilling premise that it would be a crime to increase benefits.  The answer is simple.

<|endoftext|>It is with a great deal of reluctance that I must respond to a question that I think makes the most sense to the Senator from Massachusetts and to many Members of the Senate. Our offer to sell more of our Nation's veterans healthcare needs for the cost of keeping them away is not the only way to buy insurance for those who want it. It is not the only way to pay for needed programs to ensure that they have health care care coverage that is free from unnecessary or out-of-date costs. It is the only way to get the funds necessary for the new prescription drug coverage that will be

What did they do? They raised interest rates, whether they were low or high, and borrowed billions of dollars.  That is exactly what is happening now.

While that principle has been expressed time and time again, unfortunately, current legislation with over 300 provisions in it has produced additional red tape and unnecessary mandates on local governments.  For instance, over 50 States have passed statewide anti-discrimination laws. However, a number of the laws go far beyond those ordinances and target activities and

In fact, we provided $1.4 billion less over the next 10 years than we were budgeted to spend in those 10 years, with almost all the savings in new taxes and discretionary

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, as chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, I rise today in strong support of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2005 and the so-called stimulus bill that we are about to vote on today. However, the economic security of the American people is not just about deficit reduction; it is also about jobs creation and economic growth.  While there are many issues that I agree with, and I hope my colleagues will join me in passing the balanced budget amendment, they are all tied to raising the living standards of the American people. I would argue that our reform legislation,

If we had the two leaders and the majority leader to make that call and to speak for those issues on those crimes, I do not know that the Senate would be at all possible today. But we ought to take it into account that the time is short. There is plenty of time to be ready if this new generation of Senators suddenly wants to call and ask for this

This report states the following: hydrogen production is only possible if hydrogen oxygen battery batteries can lithium cadmium (Li-Cd) electrodes.  The key to the realization of hydrogen production is a reduction in the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere resulting in the development of fuels.  Hydrogen is an abundant and renewable supply. Hydrogen fuels include ethanol, diesel, and jet fuel.  Our own engineers working with

However, I do have a concern.  As I indicated in my opening statement, I think this is a serious issue, and I think we need to give the Committee on Rules some time to consider it
