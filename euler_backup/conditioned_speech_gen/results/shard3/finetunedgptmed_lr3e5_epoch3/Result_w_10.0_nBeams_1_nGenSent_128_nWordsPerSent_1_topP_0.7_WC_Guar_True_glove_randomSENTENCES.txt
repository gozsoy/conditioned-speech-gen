Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize President Clinton for the reform of the Veterans' Administration and to honor him for his steadfast commitment to this Nation's veterans. I was honored to be able to work with President Clinton to secure a VA hospital in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which will serve our veterans in the future.  I was proud to introduce the first congressional initiative that will improve the quality of life for our Nation's veterans. This year's budget included $200 million to help establish a VA medical center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  It is my sincere hope that Congress will not only pass a strong budget but also make this new VA

The CHAMP Act is the most sweeping reform of the Public Services Corporation in almost a generation. It is also the most expensive reform. The bill provides $45 billion in new revenue for the Corporation, which is about half the amount that it spends each year. The bill provides $100 million in increased funding for a number of programs, including outreach to uninsured children, treatment of mental illness, and treatment of substance abuse disorders.

As I said, it is historic in scope, and the bill represents a major departure from the status quo. But it also represents a significant step forward.

Mr. Speaker, Speaker Gingrich's plan to end Medicare as we know it would yield a government takeover of health care. The American people know that if the Gingrich plan becomes law, there will be no more choices in the Medicare Program. The Medicare Program will be broken and the doctors who will practice in Medicare will be forced out of the program. There will be no doctors in the Medicare Program.  If you are a physician who is practicing in Medicare, and you want to continue to practice, the Gingrich plan would not allow you to do so. If you are a senior citizen who is paying into Medicare and you want to continue to pay into Medicare,

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Clinton administration budget proposal and to highlight its positive impact on the economy of this Nation and on the economy of our country in general. GDP growth is the single most important measure of the economic strength of the United States of America. Growth is a direct result of growth in private sector jobs. The Clinton budget package, while well-intentioned, does not fully capture the potential of the private sector to create jobs and expand our economy. The Clinton proposal ignores the fact that the private sector is creating fewer jobs and more job loss than the government. In my home State of Vermont, we have lost 6

It is time for a raise. The average American worker should be able to get a raise in their pay. There is a reason that the United States has the highest productivity in the world. There is a reason that we have the lowest unemployment rate in the world. The United States is the best place to work, to raise your kids, to save money, to start a family.

Mr. Chairman I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by my colleagues from New York and New Jersey and opposition to the Market Promotion Program which has a $200 million price tag for farm programs.  This amendment, which I believe would gut the Farm Bill, is being offered in a desperate attempt to make some political points, particularly in an election year. While I do not agree with the mission of the Market Promotion Program, it is a noble and valuable program. I strongly support it. It is a noble program that allows farmers and ranchers to buy up crop insurance policies from farmers, ranchers and others who are willing to put their own money into the program.

I am concerned that it will create too many loopholes for the rich.  One example is the Tax Code for People Who are Less Rich.  This legislation provides that the amount of income that an individual or family with less than $20,000 of adjusted gross income may claim for tax purposes is not subject to the 25 percent tax rate. The reason for this is that the top rate is actually much lower than the income tax rate for people with incomes over $100,000.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the ``Natural Resources Natural Protection Act of 2007.'' This afternoon we will be considering the so-called ``no fly'' list which would give the so-called ``no matter what'' executive branch officials a 90-day time limit to implement their vague and ill-defined and nebulous laws on natural resources. This list of laws, which we will consider later in the day, is the product of a poorly drafted and largely unenforced Obama administration memorandum.  Under this bill, the President could order a 90-day time limit to implement the so-called ``no matter what'' list, if he

Mr. Chairman, I would say to the chairman that I have had a number of health care proposals over the years. I have not heard any one offer more money for the whole fund than we do right now, but I think that when we talk about the Sweeney amendment, it is a perfecting amendment, it is the perfecting amendment, because it is a better amendment. It says to the chairman, as I understand it, that there are a number of things that the committee has not looked at, and we are going to look at them and come back with a better amendment, or we are going to look at them and we are going to

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the heroic efforts of the Army National Guard Brigade Combat Team airborne assault team, who fought bravely to bring down a terrorist plane near Kandahar, Afghanistan.  The brave men and women of the U.S. Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team will be recognized at a ceremony in Washington, DC, this week, as they have for years. The 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, which is based at Fort Campbell, KY, serves the northern and central parts of the United States, and is comprised of soldiers from Fort Bragg, NC, and the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team

Mr. Speaker, the moratorium bill that we are debating today was passed out of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight on a party-line vote. That means that the Democrats on the committee voted for the moratorium bill, but the Republicans on the committee voted against it. The reason they did that is because the American people want a clean environment. The American people want to see our air and water clean, our rivers and streams safe, our lakes and streams clean, and we want to protect the environment.  The problem is, if you listen to the environmentalists, the environmentalists are against the moratorium because they do not want to protect the environment.  The

<|endoftext|>Congress passed legislation authorizing the President to take action to address the issue of health care reform earlier this year. I voted in support of Hyde-Lantos and in support of the conference report on the conference report because I wanted to take the meetings that I heard in the House and at the Senate and present them to the American people.  I believe that we need to have a health care reform conference that is truly bipartisan. I believe that the American people want this bill to be real health care reform.  That is why I voted against the conference report. I voted against the conference report because it had not gone far enough. It did

Mr. Speaker, in a few short days we will be voting on a rule which will make in order the Halliburton, Halliburton, Halliburton rule. This is a dangerous and dangerous rule, because it is a rule that would make it easier for terrorists to use Halliburton.  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on International Relations, I am extremely concerned that we are being asked to vote on a rule that will open the door for terrorists to use Halliburton.  The rule we are voting on today would prohibit the use of any of the funds made available in this bill to fund any activities that would

<|endoftext|>Senate Democrats are arguing that we cannot afford any more tax increases that would ultimately burden our children and grandchildren with more debt that we cannot pay back. No reasonable person believes that claim. Indeed argument is not necessary. There is no reason that any reasonable person whatsoever would want to impose more debt upon the children of this Nation, nor any reasonable person plaintiff.  Republicans and Democrats can agree that there is a problem with our debt. We should all agree that we must get our financial house in order. The Republicans in the House and the President have done just that. And that is why the debt ceiling is a very important issue.  Republicans and
