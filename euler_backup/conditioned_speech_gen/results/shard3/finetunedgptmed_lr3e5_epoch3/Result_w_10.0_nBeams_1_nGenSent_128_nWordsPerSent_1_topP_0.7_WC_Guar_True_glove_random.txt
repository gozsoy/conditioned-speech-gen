This year's budget included $200 million to help establish a VA medical center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  It is my sincere hope that Congress will not only pass a strong budget but also make this new VA

I hope my colleagues will take the time to review the most recent and shocking of his blunders and then read his responses to some of the more serious charges he has made.  Let me start with his claim that he was not aware of the $40 billion in tax breaks that the President's administration gave to the wealthiest of Americans. If he had, he would not have written this statement.

But the question is, What is it going to cost us? Is it going to be $50 billion? Is it going to be $100 billion? We are going to be paying for it. Is it going to be $200 billion?

And he said, ``No wonder the American people do not trust us anymore.''  Well, we are not the same Republican Party.  This is not a joke.

It could take up the entire formula for all of the Federal health care programs put together by the Congressional Budget Office.  Last year, the CBO did a study of the various health care programs and found that if the bill we passed last year was adopted, none of the programs would be affected in the future.  What we need is a better formula, not a worse one. The Congressional Budget Office has found that the bill passed last year would cost $48 billion over the next 10 years, more than any other health care bill that we have ever

Mr. President, I have the honor of introducing the Congressional Budget Office Cost of Millions of Payments for Tax Increases in Federal Regulations Act of 2008 that limits increases in the deficit to $1.1 billion.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by 2010, a doubling of Federal tax rates will result in a $1.1 trillion increase in spending. The CBO estimates that the cost of this spending would be $2.4 trillion over 10 years.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation would create $10 billion in annual revenue. In addition, the legislation would increase Federal spending by $4.4 billion in 2010. In addition, the

It is important that we recognize the positive contributions that many sectors of the economy are making to our economy, and that we take action to increase opportunities for them to do so. The bill before us today will help many people across the country, including families with children, through a variety of programs.

The American people know that if the Gingrich plan becomes law, there will be no more choices in the Medicare Program. The Medicare Program will be broken and the doctors who will practice in Medicare will be forced out of the program. There will be no doctors in the Medicare Program.  If you are a physician who is practicing in Medicare, and you want to continue to practice, the Gingrich plan would not allow you to do so. If you are a senior citizen who is paying into Medicare and you want to continue to pay into Medicare,

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Clinton administration budget proposal and to highlight its positive impact on the economy of this Nation and on the economy of our country in general. GDP growth is the single most important measure of the economic strength of the United States of America. Growth is a direct result of growth in private sector jobs. The Clinton budget package, while well-intentioned, does not fully capture the potential of the private sector to create jobs and expand our economy. The Clinton proposal ignores the fact that the private sector is creating fewer jobs and more job loss than the government. In my home State of Vermont, we have lost 6

This legislation provides that the amount of income that an individual or family with less than $20,000 of adjusted gross income may claim for tax purposes is not subject to the 25 percent tax rate. The reason for this is that the top rate is actually much lower than the income tax rate for people with incomes over $100,000.

In fact, it is embarrassing to be a Member of this body, and I am sure that I am not alone in this assessment.  This administration's budget has drastically cut funding for programs important to our country's children and the elderly. We have seen them over the last few years. The student loan program, for example, has been cut in half.  If the President wants to help the poor, then he needs to provide assistance to low-income families. Unfortunately, his budget does not

I am particularly pleased that this legislation includes a provision that will allow Americans to receive life-

gains growth senator 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, Senator Inhofe and I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of one of the Nation's most significant growth companies in recent years, the Intel Corporation. As a result of its strong gains in the computer technology industry, Intel is now America's second largest company and is one of the most highly regarded corporations in the world.  I have long supported the use of Federal and private markets to expand American innovation. The innovations that have made Intel successful are not confined to the company's factories and distribution centers. In fact, their products are now found in every home, business, and home office in America. In the past 2 years, Intel

Mr. Chairman, I would say to the chairman that I have had a number of health care proposals over the years. I have not heard any one offer more money for the whole fund than we do right now, but I think that when we talk about the Sweeney amendment, it is a perfecting amendment, it is the perfecting amendment, because it is a better amendment. It says to the chairman, as I understand it, that there are a number of things that the committee has not looked at, and we are going to look at them and come back with a better amendment, or we are going to look at them and we are going to

bill moratorium reform 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the moratorium bill that we are debating today was passed out of the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight on a party-line vote. That means that the Democrats on the committee voted for the moratorium bill, but the Republicans on the committee voted against it. The reason they did that is because the American people want a clean environment. The American people want to see our air and water clean, our rivers and streams safe, our lakes and streams clean, and we want to protect the environment.  The problem is, if you listen to the environmentalists, the environmentalists are against the moratorium because they do not want to protect the environment.  The

I voted in support of Hyde-Lantos and in support of the conference report on the conference report because I wanted to take the meetings that I heard in the House and at the Senate and present them to the American people.  I believe that we need to have a health care reform conference that is truly bipartisan. I believe that the American people want this bill to be real health care reform.  That is why I voted against the conference report. I voted against the conference report because it had not gone far enough. It did

Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Committee on International Relations, I am extremely concerned that we are being asked to vote on a rule that will open the door for terrorists to use Halliburton.

No reasonable person believes that claim. Indeed argument is not necessary. There is no reason that any reasonable person whatsoever would want to impose more debt upon the children of this Nation, nor any reasonable person plaintiff.  Republicans and Democrats can agree that there is a problem with our debt. We should all agree that we must get our financial house in order. The Republicans in the House and the President have done just that. And that is why the debt ceiling is a very important issue.  Republicans and
