The major elements of the Clinton bill include the legalization of the legalization of illegal aliens, the establishment of a national credit union system to prevent fraudulent actions by credit unions, the establishment of a

I support the idea of a national identification card, but I do not believe it is a solution to our immigration problems. We should concentrate our efforts on what is really the problem, which is illegal immigration.  The purpose of my amendment is to eliminate the current patchwork of State and Federal laws on citizenship. Under the current system, the Attorney General and other officials are empowered to issue the certificate of citizenship to an immigrant. The State or local government must then

Mr. Speaker, Cincinnati requires disastrous, intolerable levels of noise to meet its needs. The Bureau of Land Management has issued a report saying that noise from highway construction is nearly double what it was in the 1960s.  Mr. Speaker, our communities are in the midst of a serious crisis. The Republican majority has done nothing to address this problem. We have been ignored.  This bill, the HEALTH Act, will help us begin to address this serious problem. It will create an important new air quality monitoring program that will increase efficiency and reduce noise.  I urge my colleagues to support the HEALTH Act.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is not just the people who are opposed to the tax cut. The American people are against the tax cut.  I urge

We wanted to know if the minority party, which is controlled by the majority party, had its way with the investigation. The answer was no.  Today, the majority party continues to obstruct the President and his administration, even though the public knows that the American people overwhelmingly want to see this investigation brought to a close.

I came to know Congressman Young in 1987 when he was the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference and I served as chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. I recall that Congressman Young was one of the first Republicans to come to Washington and tell us that he was going to help write the Republican Party's new contract.  Congressman Young was always hard to miss. He was always well-organized, well-spoken, and always thoughtful. He understood the issues of the day. And he was a stalwart defender of our Nation

This decline in the value of the dollar and the weakening of the dollar's position in international trade have resulted in a weakening of the dollar's credibility as the world's reserve currency, and thus as a world financial reserve currency.

It would cut taxes by $15 billion, which is approximately the same as what we were able to accomplish in the Senate and the House.  The budget also repeals the alternative minimum tax, and the legislation will save over $400 billion over the next 10 years. It will also allow the Medicare trust fund

One of the most disturbing trends in the health care reform debate is the accelerated decline in the number of insured Americans. It is clear that the health care system has not been reformed in a thoughtful manner.  The problem is particularly acute in my State of Minnesota. More than 70 percent of all of the workers in our State are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance. The growing number of uninsured workers in Minnesota is also a reflection of a growing demand for health insurance. In my State, the number of uninsured workers has increased by almost 100,000 over the

Mr. Chairman and Members of the worker programs services, this amendment, I believe, will result in a loss of $19 million to the workers' compensation program and $18 million to the adult and children's program, and that is where the $19 million comes from. It comes from the savings of cutting from the program which we have not yet implemented.  Now, if you want to talk about people who are not being helped, you are cutting a program that is only 2 percent of the program, and the only people you are going to help are those who are going to buy cars, pay for their kids to go to college, buy a

In the last two years, more than 4,000 servicemembers have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. A further 3,600 have been wounded in combat.

They are deeply concerned about this issue. I have also had conversations with people in the industry.
