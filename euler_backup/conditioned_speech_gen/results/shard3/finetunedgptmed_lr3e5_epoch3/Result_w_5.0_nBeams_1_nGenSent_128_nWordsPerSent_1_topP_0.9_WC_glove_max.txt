Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 280 is a budget resolution conference agreement reached with the President, Senate Democrats and Republican House leaders to provide a 2-year balanced budget for the Federal Government. House Resolution 280 provides for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution which limits congressional spending to a ceiling of $250 billion over the next 7 years.  While it is true that the House-Senate conference agreement will not change the balanced budget agreement reached by the President and Senate Democrats, I am very pleased that this agreement maintains the pay-as-you-go rules which already prevail in the budget legislation that is before us today. This bill and its leaders tell us what

Mr. Speaker, for over 40 years Congress has promised seniors on Medicare they would never see a cut in their Medicare benefits. Since President Clinton took office in 1993, we have been able to cut the cost of health care in this country by over $5 billion a year. But Congress has failed to keep its promise to the country's seniors by failing to pass a budget that balances the budget in 7 years using honest numbers and cuts spending in the areas that need it the most. Senator Dole and I have introduced the Family Reinvestment Act to put health care back on the middle market and to reduce prices for seniors.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, today I would like to commemorate the 23d anniversary of the release of the first United States air attack on Iraq by a United States military aircraft. March 3, 2003 was a day that we lost two of the finest Americans, Brian Pizzella and John Olver. They are just two of the servicemembers to be lost in military service in Iraq since the war in 2003 began.  On March 3, 2003, the 44-foot LPD-7 Chinook helicopter of the U.S. 4th Fleet took off from the base in Seagram, TX, and landed in Al Anbar Province in Iraq.

We need to be focusing on the most important issue facing the Nation right now and that is jobs and growing our economy, not being distracted by the policy of giving tax breaks to the people who need them the most.  It seems like the Democratic leadership has been focused more on how they can give the wealthiest among us more money rather than what their vision for the future of our Nation is for this country. It is critical we do pass a minimum wage increase this year so that American

It is intended to change the way Government works so that future generations can be prosperous and responsible.

As a Senator from the heartland of this Nation, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, as chairman of the subcommittee responsible for appropriations for the Department of Defense, I have seen the critical role the military and their missions play in carrying out our Nation's defense. I have seen the use of the military in a time of war and during a time of peace. I have seen military personnel serving to keep American soldiers safe in the field and abroad, who risk their lives in a struggle for freedom

Madam Speaker, in Michigan, it is hard to get by. A criminal offense under this legislation is not known by most people as a simple misdemeanor crime. A criminal act can be charged with multiple offenses and, under this bill, the prosecutor will have to prove that the acts by the defendant were meant to promote the commission of a crime.  Well, I am certainly not buying this bill. I have a court date to attend next week, and I plan to miss an opportunity to speak on this. There is no way I can afford to miss the opportunity.

This is a simple matter of the economics. One reason is that we import so much foreign oil and we lose so many jobs to those in foreign countries who want to use those resources to get their own independence in other nations. But that is another important reason we have to see this opportunity for alternative energy come to the West because we cannot have our independence from foreign sources without having those sources here at home available to us. Because it is our own people, the citizens of the West

<|endoftext|>Payroll taxes in the United States cost more than those in Britain and other countries. The most recent data by the IRS shows that the average American family paid 40 percent of its income to tax collection agencies while in Britain it was only 10 percent. The tax burden is high in this country because we have so few businesses and so few small businesses to pay the taxman on their wages and in their products. The average American employee would have to work 40 years before he or she would qualify for a full refund from their government and get the money back for their work done.  Our citizens should be able to hold their government accountable for the work

This bill would make it easier for Washington bureaucrats to make the regulations they create more expensive by cutting them in half from $100 billion to $50 billion. That is wrong because there is no reason why we should not increase the amount that the Federal Government can spend each year, but this House Republicans refuse to do so.  This bill will increase spending for a variety of purposes, from establishing caps on Federal programs, to rolling back Clean Air and Clean Water

This year's budget resolution will call for spending levels for fiscal year 1998 that are 3

Madam President, my home State of Iowa has long been a leader in the renewable energy industry and one that has made tremendous progress in improving the environment while strengthening economic activity and job creation. I believe it is important to ensure that we continue to foster economic growth and job creation in our State while simultaneously reducing our deficit. This amendment would help achieve this goal through the adoption of legislation I authored with Senator Harkin to increase the renewable energy R&D tax credit, or renewable R&D tax credit, from $10 billion in 2005 to $20 billion in 2013 and for the first time grant credit for each R&D Federal research and development.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to first want to commend the leadership of the Committee on Appropriations for the work that they did on this bill. This legislation provides funding to the Department of Defense for the following activities: The Department of the Army has established a new homeland security portion of its initiative to increase the capabilities of the Guard and Reserve to carry out their vital functions, and to improve and strengthen the ability of the Army and the Corps of Engineers to carry out their vital functions in the event of a national emergency or natural disaster.

So my question would be: What is wrong with making this a name?

We have no choice but to act as a nation to protect ourselves and our people. To do so effectively we must focus on making the Department of Homeland Security as effective as it can be to respond to terrorist attacks.

The so-called chained CPI has been identified as the ``dead-eyed message to the American people of the Republican budget that the Republicans will abandon the balanced budget without a problem to face America in the near term.''

I had the chance to travel down to the top of the Capitol, the Senate Chamber in this building, to see the challenges the American people have that Congress has left to address. We have the fact that the Federal Government is shut down for the second time in a week and the fact that the Republican majority cannot figure out how to fund our Government and get it going again.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Thurmond in introducing the New Jersey Transit Benefit Program Reauthorization Act of 1995. This bill will reauthorize a significant benefit program for New Jersey Transit in response to the introduction of a much needed formula to determine New Jersey Transit benefits in the 2002 New Jersey City Transit Act.  The benefit program of the New Jersey Transit Benefit Program was set up in 1997 by the New Jersey General Assembly and has since been extended by the subsequent New Jersey City Transit Act in 2006. Over the years that this benefit has been extended to New Jersey Transit, the program has been extended multiple times and the Federal Government has provided

Mr. President, we are at a time when the American people are going to remember what happened yesterday when the Senate debated a Republican proposal to increase the debt limit on the floor of the Senate. The debate began with a policy debate on the need to reform and change the way we spend money in the country and end the Democrat and Republican borrow-and-spend programs. The central question we are debating is a fundamental question of whether Congress will become an all-knowing body or whether it will continue to serve as a rubber stamp for the previous President of the United States when it comes to our daily spending decisions and future decisions about our Nation.

This change was made in 1982 because Social Security is defined by the Internal Revenue Service as the ``most current social insurance program.''

Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of the FAA Restructuring and Reform Act of 2012 because we must make sure that our communities remain safe and productive as we struggle to deal with the ever-growing problems of high energy prices.  The bill before us today represents a step in the right direction that will help reduce the cost of the Federal Government and improve our lives across the country. It will not result in a complete overhaul of the Federal Aviation Administration but it does provide for a crucial change to the Federal Aviation Administration that will more closely resemble the original National Transportation Safety Board. This new structure will help the NTSB to move more quickly to identify

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment increases the funding for programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to $15 million in fiscal year 2006 and then increases spending for the International Housing Service at $3 million for fiscal year 2007. We want to do this because the amount of money that is in the bill for the International Housing Service is really quite modest by comparison to what we need to keep all these programs going in an effort to continue to support these very low-income communities that are the very ones who need the most help in the program. It increases the funding for the International Housing

I thank Chairman Bond for his assistance in getting this bill before the Senate and for his outstanding leadership on the committee and on the floor of the Senate on all of these important issues.

Mr. President, if I could make one last point because I think there is a lot of confusion around the country about this amendment when it came up a couple of years ago and I think a lot of us have forgotten about it. The notion of somehow, a matter of principle, we need to prohibit the advocacy of effective lobbying practices on the part of government contractors as if they are government contractors would really in my view be the height of hypocrisy, of hypocrisy of which I have never seen it and certainly could not ever find it as an example of what is wrong with ethics and this concept of lobbying on behalf of government contractors.

The Committee is providing funding for basic science on a flat grant basis to all fiscal years 1998 through 2012.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Chief Mike Reitman of the Island County Sheriff's Department who recently died of injuries he sustained while performing his duties as the village of Iquitos Deputy Sheriff.

Those who knew him say he was an example of the courage and tenacity of a dedicated public servant who could get things done for those around him. People can only be so lucky to have a husband

And I am grateful for his work on this bill for getting us to the point where we can start the budget for the United States of America in a bipartisan fashion that will provide for the national defense of the country, not the partisan use of that budget by one side or another, to determine what programs they want to spend money for

The bill before us today has the support of over 30 Members of the House and Senate who have introduced similar legislation. The bill has also enjoyed the support of the administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Further, under the FLRA, unions are required to recognize the membership of nonmembers in the event of a strike by striking workers who may be employees of a member organization that is in a strike that results in damage to a local

After all the rhetorical bravado and the promises made on the campaign trail to bring our troops home, President Clinton has said that we are now in a ``critical situation.'' What that means is that the war against Iraq has been brought to a screeching halt, and with it an opportunity to give our troops the resources and training they need to be effective in the most difficult of assignments.  Our troops need training for a foreign battlefield, not a domestic battlefield. Our troops are armed with less
