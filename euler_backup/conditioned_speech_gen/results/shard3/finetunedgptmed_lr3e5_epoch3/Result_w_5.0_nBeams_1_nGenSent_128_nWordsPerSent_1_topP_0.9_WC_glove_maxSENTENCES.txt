Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 280 is a budget resolution conference agreement reached with the President, Senate Democrats and Republican House leaders to provide a 2-year balanced budget for the Federal Government. House Resolution 280 provides for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution which limits congressional spending to a ceiling of $250 billion over the next 7 years.  While it is true that the House-Senate conference agreement will not change the balanced budget agreement reached by the President and Senate Democrats, I am very pleased that this agreement maintains the pay-as-you-go rules which already prevail in the budget legislation that is before us today. This bill and its leaders tell us what

Mr. Speaker, for over 40 years Congress has promised seniors on Medicare they would never see a cut in their Medicare benefits. Since President Clinton took office in 1993, we have been able to cut the cost of health care in this country by over $5 billion a year. But Congress has failed to keep its promise to the country's seniors by failing to pass a budget that balances the budget in 7 years using honest numbers and cuts spending in the areas that need it the most. Senator Dole and I have introduced the Family Reinvestment Act to put health care back on the middle market and to reduce prices for seniors.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, today I would like to commemorate the 23d anniversary of the release of the first United States air attack on Iraq by a United States military aircraft. March 3, 2003 was a day that we lost two of the finest Americans, Brian Pizzella and John Olver. They are just two of the servicemembers to be lost in military service in Iraq since the war in 2003 began.  On March 3, 2003, the 44-foot LPD-7 Chinook helicopter of the U.S. 4th Fleet took off from the base in Seagram, TX, and landed in Al Anbar Province in Iraq.

The most recent data by the IRS shows that the average American family paid 40 percent of its income to tax collection agencies while in Britain it was only 10 percent. The tax burden is high in this country because we have so few businesses and so few small businesses to pay the taxman on their wages and in their products. The average American employee would have to work 40 years before he or she would qualify for a full refund from their government and get the money back for their work done.  Our citizens should be able to hold their government accountable for the work

Madam President, my home State of Iowa has long been a leader in the renewable energy industry and one that has made tremendous progress in improving the environment while strengthening economic activity and job creation. I believe it is important to ensure that we continue to foster economic growth and job creation in our State while simultaneously reducing our deficit. This amendment would help achieve this goal through the adoption of legislation I authored with Senator Harkin to increase the renewable energy R&D tax credit, or renewable R&D tax credit, from $10 billion in 2005 to $20 billion in 2013 and for the first time grant credit for each R&D Federal research and development.

That is not the only piece of this legislation that is bad. For example, the Farmers Risk and Loss Coverage program that we passed out of the Senate that would have affected farmers and landowners around this country is a bad bill that would cost the people of this country thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of losses.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the government shutdown that is taking place in the District of Columbia and all over the country. It is now an annual event for many in the House and many other places that have been hit with it as well. For years now it has been an ongoing debate about what to do with our Nation's Department of the District of Columbia and how to continue to fund the government. When the budget expires on September 30 of this year, it would be my hope that Congress would put an end to this year's shutdown and make the D.C. government business as normal as possible.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill.  Mr. Chairman, we have a bill that is fiscally sound. This amendment would add $1.3 billion to a program that has been $200 million below the level authorized by this Congress.  In fiscal year 1995, the current level of funding for airport improvement grants is $875 million, an increase of $10 million. And it will rise to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1997.  This subcommittee has an extraordinarily tough job. This is not a simple program.  The rural airports which we need to assist need help in the development of general aviation facilities.

Mr. President, in 1980 the Internal Revenue Service published and distributed a document called the ``Rate of Income Tax and Tax Measurement of Income and Assets of Persons by State and for Individual Income Tax Purposes''. This document reflected, among other things, the fact that, since the beginning of the last century, the definition of ``social security benefit'' in the Tax Code had changed from Social Security contributions to Social Security benefits. This change was made in 1982 because Social Security is defined by the Internal Revenue Service as the ``most current social insurance program.'' The definition of ``Social Security benefit'' as given in the Tax Code continues to change to reflect this change
