Mr. Speaker, this month is World Agricultural Week in United States and every year Congress focuses its attention on the critical role that agriculture plays in our Nation's economy and in supporting the health of our country and the global community. Congress also recognizes the role of the United States in the successful adaptation of science and technology to address the drama of changing global conditions.  In this Congress, Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Smith highlighted the importance of agriculture on September 22, 1994. In the subcommittee chairman's message to the full committee, he states, ``It is critical that as Congress debates agriculture appropriations and measures affecting agriculture to the minds

The new service delivery initiatives created by this plan will assist hospitals, health care providers, and their patients.  I have long advocated for improved coordination of patient care and emergency management services for a nationally coordinated national strategy for improving patient health and health care delivery.

Now what the ranking member on our side of the aisle has done is his economic stimulus bill of 2006, also known as the Tax Code Reciprocity Act, is just another example of a bill that Republicans have put forward to be paid for

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Washington State to keep the Export-Import Bank as it exists today. Science and technology research exports, especially in the automotive and aerospace industry, are one of the best ways to create jobs and grow our economy. Investing in these fields should be a no-brainer.  Our economic security depends on exports, and the success of our automotive industry has been directly linked to exports. Right now, China's automotive sector creates half the Nation's car sales and nearly all of America's auto exports. Over the past several years, China

I wanted to make it clear that the purpose of this new vision, the Rogers amendment, is not to eliminate post offices, or the present system of disability assistance, for people with disabilities. The purpose is to reduce the burden on the States and the Federal Government that are currently unable to protect the rights of people with disabilities in the post office and in the work force

I think there is bipartisan support out there on doing something about our broken immigration system as well as dealing with our broken environmental standpoint. We are ready. But let me get back to my colleagues, who know it better than anyone else cleaned it up, clean it up. We should have bipartisan support for the Cornyn amendment and for the Hoyer amendment.

The Republicans are proposing to carve out $70 billion in savings in the health care program in order to make up for the $700 billion under this category.  This is a sensible way to proceed. The House Republicans proposed in their budget that seniors pay up to $4,500 per year for Medicare. This is the amount seniors are expected to pay to buy private health insurance. The Senate

Close to 1 million new unemployed are in need of our support. The number of primary care clinics across our State are being forced to close their doors due to the resulting reductions in research observations. Some communities are literally in ruin.  During this budget debate, there has been a call to cut the health services programs which provide relief to our senior citizens. This amendment is an important first step in recognizing the tremendous and highly acclaimed contribution

Mr. Speaker, today the House is considering legislation that would help address the growing problem of patent trolls. Although Congress established patent troll regulations in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in the 103d Congress the House passed a much more robust patent law known as the Patent Sale Reform Act which makes no specific reference to auctions of patents. Rather, the Federal courts have interpreted the Patent Sale Reform Act, with substantial fines and penalties, to cover the sale of patents at auction.  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that the majority of these transactions are conducted without regard to actual fair market value. In fact, rather than

We knew that there was still much work to be done, including improving access to the medication and supporting many of the communities affected by marijuana's use. Unfortunately, medical marijuana remains illegal under federal law, and this provision remains underfunded

For the last 2 years, the House and the Senate have been working out a farm bill which funds the National Science Foundation as well as the National Institutes of Health. This is an excellent bill for this country and has been so much better than the two competing energy bills, the energy bill in last year's budget

Rural communities have not always been rural, but they have served as the backdrop of a broad range of important decisions about a large part of our Nation's history.

But in the case of the rule for the House, it seems that the Republicans are about to take the health of our Members for granted.

Mr. President, there is no more important issue in America today than work in America. The American people need work, but work is in short supply here in Washington today as President Bush seeks reelection and Washington stands around and omits the important work of the people of Maine.

That is not true when it comes to jobs in Washington. I am talking about rural health care, job training and training opportunities, education and job training.  This is a

New Jersey lawmakers were once again caught off-guard when Congress failed to adopt much-needed cuts in the 2008 budget before the election last November. A vote to increase revenues in January 2009 was written into a reauthorization of the law the following year. But the President refused to sign the legislation into law, instead sticking to promises that the deficit would be reduced.

The Nation's parks and public lands have been endowed with tremendous promise for the benefit of the American public for over 100 years overdue for a restoration of the native American forest ecosystem. In recognition of this promise, it is appropriate for Congress to address and guarantee a full restoration of the threatened and endangered American elm, too.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to address President Bush's criticism of the welfare reform bill as it applies to Hawaii. I have concerns about the provisions of the welfare reform legislation and how it is being implemented in Hawaii. In particular, in a recent outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Hawaii, President Bush had some harsh words for the State of Hawaii for failing to increase assistance to those affected by the disease Nigeria or in the country of Rwanda. He called the welfare reform proposal in Hawaii ``unnecessary,'' ``almost wholly ineffective,'' and ``without any real benefit.'' In response to these harsh comments
