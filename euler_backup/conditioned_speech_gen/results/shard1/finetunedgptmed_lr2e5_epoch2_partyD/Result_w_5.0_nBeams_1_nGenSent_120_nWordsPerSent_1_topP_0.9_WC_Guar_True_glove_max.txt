Mr. President, earlier this year the Senate passed the legislation that would create the No Child Left Behind Act of 2005 to reform the way in which our Nation schools are designed and how they are operated to make them more effective in moving students from grade to grade and from year to year and back again in our public schools that every parent in this bill would have in their back yard. The No Child Left Behind Act prioritizes improving educational outcomes.  That is why the bill is so important. I hope that we will not delay this bill, in part, as a result of some troubling misinformation in the media about

As Members of Congress and Americans we have come to identify ourselves as Americans and Black people through our radical efforts to bring the equal rights and treatment of African Americans into the struggle for freedom and to end all forms of anti-Black terrorism and terrorism against terrorists and civilians alike.  It is also important to acknowledge the cultural and civil rights achievements of all combatants in World War II. It is no less important to recognize and celebrate the civil rights victories of African Americans throughout our history.

That has gone through a very rigorous hearing process. I think it has the support of both the industry as well as from the hearing public.

The report cited its leadership role as ``the Nation's only publicly supported effort to change priorities in ideology without increasing the federal budget deficit.'' That report also noted that frustration with the government funding spending in the 1027 Program intensified last year.

Mr. Chairman, the proponents of this tax bill claim to support the defense of the Constitution and the basic American values of the rights and liberties of all Americans. However, the Republican leadership forces the Army and the Air Force to conduct a highly modified version of the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force against civilian citizens in Iraq, without the 3rd amendment of the Constitution or the 14th amendment of the Constitution.  The repeal of the defense of the Constitution's provisions for due process and equal protection under the law are also being implemented.

Mr. President, in the past 24 hours it has become increasingly clear that the Nation is being threatened by another terrorist attack, this time on the homefront of the United States of America.  In the past 24 hours we have learned of a possible `` habitat attack'' in that some people are either trying to breed fish or to experiment with creating air pollutants in streams and on lakes.  This should be of concern to the American people because it is the number one issue facing our Nation at this time, not only with respect to terror attacks but with respect to national security.

And that could come at any time in the future.  The gentleman's position is unfortunate. The information, as Mr. Serrano pointed out, is clear. The bill would result in significant cleanup costs, real costs.  The gentleman has not asked for the release of any of his information, I might add.

Mr. Speaker, the other point that the President made last night was the fact that part of the responsibility for what he would like to do is he is an original cosponsor of the DOD Language Act. He said a year ago that he was looking for that language because he said when NASA got some budgets for the next 10 years, they wanted to do the job, they did, and that is all they wanted to do; he said they wanted to go into space. Now they are back at the time they said they did not.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Annette Bennett was born in Bern mitch, Germany, in 1932 and educated at Princeton in 1943 before joining the U.S. Air Force at age 17. The unanimous first class of the Air Force's Short Takeoff Course in New Mexico was named in her honor, and over the years she would serve as a local educator, not to mention a National Medal of Honor recipient.

The new House majority passed a similar bill on April 15 of last year but the Senate was just not on board and it took Jersey City a good while to get it passed. Now they are ready to pass it.  The manager of this bill, the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson], has come to me to get approval of this particular resolution. It is

Madam President, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors recently announced the release of its annual and most recently announced policy for the Federal Reserve to create interest rate policy for financial companies and to raise interest rates for people who own or hold shares in them. While I know some have been very troubled by the actions taken by the Federal Reserve to set those children's interest rates, the Fed's announcement is not at all necessary to address the current economic problems facing our Nation.  Interest rates have been elevated for too long in part because of record levels of Federal spending. There are new programs that need to be funded in order for

Mr. President, Senator Dorgan is here to speak about the domestic production tax credit. That is the small business tax credit that most businesses have access to and is responsible for increasing revenues for our country. The Senate Democratic plan calls for a small business tax credit increase of $600 billion over 10 years in order to continue making investments that will pay benefits for our businesses and pay costs for the Federal Government. That is simply the right thing to do.  The House's version, on which the Senate Democratic plan is based, would bring our tax cuts for small businesses into line with all other income and tax cuts in

It is an effort to bring about the American people's confidence in the process and the very means by which they are being protected against the most of the side-by-side of record increases in tax expenditures, giveaways to the wealthy, and bad advice about how our country will pay for its vast future.

This bill makes important improvements to the provision that vets can be stationed in new locations outside of the 50 States. While this provision requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop an acceptable new policy and procedure

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1231 legislation which would authorize the use of Federal funds for the construction of an immigration reform enforcement office at the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington. This will not only ensure our nation's immigration laws are enforced but protect American liberties.  In 1989 Congress passed a law that created the Immigration and Naturalization Service within the Department of State. One of the first jobs the new office will do is to encourage compliance with immigration laws.  The management of our immigration system requires that we effectively monitor these immigrants and their ability to access our law enforcement agencies

By targeting people who have made constructive contributions to our society, the Executive order sets a dangerous precedent that could threaten the fundamental civil rights of our Nation's Muslim immigrants.  I want to stress how critical this debate is. The provisions in the Executive order are badly needed to protect our Nation's immigrant families, who face many of the same immigration challenges that other Americans do. This is particularly important

Madam Speaker, I have great respect for the ranking member of the subcommittee and the legislation itself, but I will oppose this bill on its face because of its lack of effort to provide States with new authorities for ensuring that they are putting funds into education and strengthening their infrastructure. We need to look at costs, how it affects the taxpayers, how it impacts the people who are there trying to fill the gaps.  Let's talk about three funds in this legislation. The bill says it will increase the number of ``National Teacher's Loan Service Centers.'' But it leaves out a provision to provide States with the flexibility to

Madam President, in the House of Representatives this morning, Senator Grassley introduced legislation that would allow the Department of the Interior to develop and enforce laws that ban terrorist financing on Federal lands as part of the Department of the Interior authorization bill legislation passed earlier this week and passed unanimously by the Senate Technical Committee this week. I was pleased that Senator Grassley proposed amendment No. 381 which would make it possible for the Department of the Interior to implement the provisions in the Bank Secrecy Act that prohibit terrorist financing on public lands.  This legislation would require the Secretary of the Interior to implement the Bank Secrecy Act in carrying out

Mr. President, I just want to say that as I speak it is almost a reality that the very senior Senator from West Virginia is probably not aware that because it is considered an evening to be noted by the Republican leader that Senator Bennett has asked unanimous consent that in the managers' amendment that he be given the opportunity to make his request that the bill be laid aside pending his behalf be placed upon it. That is the unanimous consent request. The bill should have been laid aside because he didn't ask for a rollcall vote.  Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Bennett is not here. I

Unfortunately, we are on the precipice of another government shutdown and this Congress has shown our disdain for the student loan interest rate increase.

Mr. Speaker, President Bush's veto of the pending bill would threaten jobs in this country and would make it much more likely that the Speaker would offer a job to somebody other than this administration if the bill did not get passed this month. That would be very serious to our Nation because that would extend beyond this session to the next session of Congress. It would also mean that unless Congress acted this year or acted before this objection came from the White House, we would have no recourse to have a grand bargain to balance the budget in 7 years.

I thank the Senator for her leadership. I am very honored to do this and I am glad that it will be taken up.  The amendment I will offer is a much different piece of legislation than my companion.

I ask my colleagues to please look at this amendment for the desk and review for themselves.  Senator Nunn and I have been working hard in these last several weeks on this very important legislation which is aimed at protecting veterans health care, working on ways to extend critical health benefits, and supporting programs to help farmers and ranchers provide for their families.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 2556 and my trusty bill the Spending Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007. This legislation will make Federal spending more transparent so that Federal revenue can be accurately calculated.  One of the more troubling aspects of budget deficits is that they are caused by the failure of the Federal Government to plan properly. The concept of constant growth can be used to make deficit reduction unsustainable. Instead, the Federal Government must be constantly innovating and raising the bar in addressing the problems of growing government.  During this Congress I have worked on the spending bill with Chairman Rostenkowski

Mr. Speaker, this was a bipartisan effort, and I thank the gentlewoman from New York for her spirited presentation on the need for this resolution to provide health insurance for all Americans.  We cannot reduce the number of uninsured Americans; that is why I voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act

It is not seeking to significantly diminish our Nation's educational resources. On the contrary, this bill would increase by over $20 billion the overall delegate allocated for each fiscal year by approximately $40 billion, so the funding provided is sufficient to meet the full tuition, room, and board fees and the additional educational expenses of each eligible beneficiary.

Our objection is that this rhetoric must stop. In fact, we must act right now to reassert fiscal responsibility and reorder the tax system so that we can finance the necessary investments.

There is no precedent on the part of the Federal Government that would allow a commercial airline company to pay whatever they would like, in any Federal marketplace, for title II airports. The very fact of the matter is that private aviation companies have prevailed in purchasing airports. Even if the FAA administrator grants the noncommercial air carriers a license to operate, even if they get a certificate and pay

Mr. President, the past few days have been very sad for the people of the State of New York and particularly the people of the State of New York in the wake of the recent fact that today we will be considering S. 434 to reauthorize appropriations for the Environmental Protection Agency. A few days ago the House of Representatives made a large rise in the budget of EPA, $160 million. And the Senate responded by cutting EPA by more than $21 million.  And now, with yet another disaster in the State of New York and with the appropriations bill pending, we are faced with the prospect that

The committee and the administration have always refused to approve these nominations because they were Hunter-Lantos-style conflicts of interest.  There is a specific requirement that those who manage such cabinet officers have the highest ethical standard, an old standard set by the House as far back as the

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, it is Bill and Hillary Clinton who have come out against the welfare reform legislation before us today and which will be introduced shortly by our former Republican colleagues in the Senate because of the fact that they do not believe in this legislation as West Virginia's needs require.  The welfare bill is a Federal program that the Congress must pass. Bill Clinton was not about to sign the welfare bill that came to the Senate. Therefore, he signed a measure that gutted benefits and eliminated all means-tested assistance in order to provide welfare recipients with the only piece of assistance they deserve: adequate and nutritious meals, clothing

What I want to focus on in the forefront is the enormous tax cuts for the wealthiest people in our society. It's outrageous. My friends on the other side of the aisle claim they reclaim what they claim is their opposition to tax cuts. But what they really are doing is playing the same old shell game with the deficit

Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his hard work on this bipartisan legislation that the gentleman has just indicated will be a welcome addition to the Federal effort to help schools hire as much as they can.

The fathers and daughters of America must be able to get ready to graduate high school, and Congress must do all it can to ensure that these schools are prepared to offer a wide array of diploma and certificate programs.  A recent Federal study shows that of the 68,000 elementary schools in the country,

This comment was delivered by the President as he spoke at a ceremony held in his remarks to Members of the Congress in January in which the President also expressed his support for the use of force against Syria to begin a process to bring to a peaceful end the civil war.  Yesterday, in his book, ``America's Wars,'' President Bush

The amendment I'm offering increases the Oil Pollution Control Security account, which is a program which I've worked for, but which

We created a public trust in our financial institutions, along with a supervisory board made up of thousands of people whose sole objective was to safeguard the integrity of our financial institutions, in particular lending and insurance companies.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to salute the military and the brave men and women who serve our country in the United States Air Force and the Army Air Corps. These men and women defend our freedom and duty, and they must be commended for their extraordinary performance on the battlefield.  The Air Force represents the full spectrum of the military services. In the Air Force the greatest asset is its talent and dedication, but the Air Force also requires airmen and women who have basic air skills, such as the aviation mechanic and the navigator, to be trained in the complex aviation,

The State Department strongly opposes this proliferation and critical development. These sanctions against North Korea are appropriate and sufficient, and a clear message to Kim Jong Un and his agents in the Chinese regime is the United States stands with our allies in confronting this danger.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

goal leave jersey 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, there will not be a time to get this bill passed before the May recess so we will go to conference on another bill this week to let them leave town without any real new business before the break.  But the Republican leadership has a new goal in mind: nothing is more important than the Republican tax bill which is putting an enormous windfall to the very wealthy in their new Jersey-based corporations. It is astounding that just after a week of opening day they are ducking the responsibilities of the Rules Committee, protecting special interest repeal, and preventing the full voice vote on important and necessary legislation,

This study would determine the range of time to Arizona with respect to implementing these requirements, determine whether any impediments could be reasonably avoided with respect to implementing these requirements, and report back to Congress in early 1997.  By considering these principles, we are able to allow for a thoughtful and balanced approach to the problem. The time period that is required for implementation will give States flexibility to utilize the existing loopholes in the

Our projections suggest that that tax cut will cost an additional $9.3 trillion. According to the Congressional Budget Office, that tax cut will not only help the rich at the expense of working people in America, it will also disproportionately harm hard-working, middle-class Americans.

It has been over the last several months that Americans have been asking us why we can't reform the system and we have been saying that reform should come to the plan that you get on the insurance company, the one that gives you that commercial plan that gives you that coverage.

The only way that the American people will be given the best is by the administration section of this budget agreement, where the increases are not tied to increase spending.  For example, the administration and this Congress are willing to increase every other Federal grant by 20 percent. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that increases

This program gives cities a loan and other aid to address violence, crime, and even poverty.  The point I am trying to make is that we are not making this adjustment right now.

Now we are going to be here another week to debate whether or not it is a good deal.  In the entire United States of America, only 10 percent of our people have health insurance

Over 200 Federal judges hauled the NRA in court in the wake of the Newtown massacre to vote unanimously to make the 5-day waiting period for background checks shorter. We have already set an example for the rest of the country by passing tougher gun control measures, but

The Republican leadership is stymied in completing a tax bill because there is nothing we can do at this time to get Berger's book off the shelf.  There are many things we could do in this bill that would make it fairer and more equitable for small business and family farmers in this country. They

I certainly do not think this should stand in the way of a consent request being approved and sent out before negotiations commence on the final legislation.  I defer to the Senator from Connecticut in adjournment or, as the case may be, at some other time.  The <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, the cuts that we would need to make to pay for the tax cuts that have been projected for the next fiscal year would be very difficult to sustain in our budget, and I support a budget that cuts the deficit in half by 2002. However, I would oppose a budget that would spend $1.2 trillion in order to pay for that.  Furthermore, I do not believe that these tax cuts are the best use of the tax cuts. I do not think it is fair to cut the tax cuts when these tax cuts are being saved by paying for the spending cuts. This makes no sense

I think any of those schools can be judged, but only by the money that it brings in. But we give that money out to the organizations that operate these stores.

He also recently helped to restore the Pell Grant program, a program that was set to expire for poor and minority students in 2010. Unfortunately, those reforms were not restored, and that will continue to

Mr. Chairman, this amendment would ensure that the Department of Energy and the Department of the Treasury will have adequate oversight of committee efforts to reduce shortfalls in low- yielding contracts.  The amendment requires the GAO to report back to the Congress on a program for evaluating the quality and performance of big duck consulting firms. The purpose of this amendment is to help Congress gauge the effectiveness of this program.  This bill limits an amendment I proposed on a previous bill to the Senate bill. I supported the bill, but I was concerned that the subcommittee chairman would not allow this amendment to be passed on to the conference report

Why?  Because the legislature was not elected to fix this problem and take action. That's a question that will have to be addressed in the future, as we address the spending bill and continuing resolution and even as we talk about welfare reform, but today we are simply saying that the bill will move forward on an indefinite number of amendments.
