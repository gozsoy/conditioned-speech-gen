Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states in its first year of law that no funds shall be made available to any entity to conduct the physical or chemical evaluation of materials that may be used in the manufacture of an item subject to this act. That was a wrong decision that has now come to be an incorrect policy. If any Member would like to do something to make it right, he can come and offer an amendment to correct it in the future. But this is not the way to do it. This bill should be called the EPA Enhancement of Congressional Accountability for Materials and Environmental Standards Act of 1994. The bill before us is a very important first step in that direction. We should be cutting down and eliminating waste, and we should be looking to the future not only for the items that we

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I believe is one of the most important issues facing this Congress as we move forward with the balanced budget amendment and address our debt issue, which is now very serious. It is very difficult for us to do that now in an honest way because what we are doing is cutting spending more than is happening on the other side. We are doing it by going out of control in spending and increasing the debt. This is not fair for the future of this country because it will hurt our children and our grandchildren and it will hurt future generations if we do not do something about that very real problem.  We have in our effort to balance the budget the needs of the Federal Government to be on a safe and solid basis. We want to have a level of revenue consistent

I appreciate your efforts to find ways to achieve greater value in this area by requiring additional information from the United States Government and requiring the USDA to pay the other countries that apply for the research grants to provide different types of information such as a failure to report on past payments or inaccurate information.

Since this legislation was reported out of the committee by a voice vote in 1995 and the full House by a voice vote in 1996, there has been almost one-third of a million pounds of waste from the Department of Veterans Affairs that have been brought to the Federal floor to the public's health that have been discarded.

Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is necessary to limit the Federal Government's power to create spending through spending programs like Medicare or Medicaid or any other government program that is critical to America's economic and social future.  For more than 30 years, proponents of this amendment have claimed that the amendment would not have a drastic effect on the budget. But the amendment is not even a balanced budget amendment. It is a one-time trick to move away from the unsustainable growth of Federal spending that the ``continuity of Government'' requirement is intended to correct.  Contrary to this argument, the amendment does not stop the President from spending money. In fact, the budget resolution before us today does nothing to prohibit President Obama from spending money, but rather it merely declares that only authorized spending under the Congressional Budget Act can be permitted to exceed CBO's

I have been trying to find some way to make this work, to make this fair, to see if there is some way we can come up with a more bipartisan way to work out this very complicated problem that the gentleman from Georgia has put forward.

When we talk about American trade, we should always remember that we do not start our trade policy out of this House alone and that we should always be responsible to our constituents so that they have that kind of a representative government here in this body so we can tell them what to do if we think that they do not like what we do or we think it does not come from their Government.

The Secretary of the Department of Agriculture recently informed the Senate Agriculture Committee that the fiscal year 1996 farm bill does not include adequate funding for the Farm-to-Market Program, or FA-Mops, in its Supplemental Appropriations Act for the Agricultural Marketing Service.

For more than 20 years, there's the question of what to do with the San Francisco Medical Center. It is the kind of medical facility that we should be passing on to the next generation instead of just shutting it down so that we can return it to the private sector. It was established by a group of devoted dedicated citizens that wanted to support research for a disease that is so widespread that one out of every eight people in the United States will get sick from it each year. This facility has done such a good job of keeping this disease at bay for so many years that it now deserves to be kept in the hands of its original sponsor and keep it functioning for the people that it has given so much to serve their country.  We all remember what the doctors say when they were talking about the fact that the San Francisco Medical Center

This country has come to the point now where you can only pay 30 percent of what the public asked for and if you increase the deficit you have to increase the taxes to pay for it. Now, Mr. Speaker, where is the deficit when you increase the taxes in the first place?

In my view, this is one of the most important votes this Nation will be taking this year to address a very serious issue that we have before us. This debate does not require that we have to take sides in this debate. What we must do is decide which policies have the most ``will to be effective'' and which policies are responsible for the widespread destruction of reproductive rights in this country. This has to be an issue that should be the ``right to be heard.'' We can debate whether abortion is the right thing to do for women, but this Congress should not turn a blind eye to the decades of

This is a commonsense measure that will enhance the agency's expertise and direct the agency to work toward specific park goals and key needs.  This amendment includes language that will require the park to implement and conduct a thoughtful and strategic land-use plan before any increase is implemented on national park lands in the year 2020 or later. To demonstrate the success of this amendment, the House should vote on the bill before us today that includes this language as an amendment to H.R. 1308, the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019 and beyond.

These are two basic priorities--and on that I agree with the Senator from North Dakota. Yet, for the past several weeks, Republicans on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee have continued to delay comprehensive, long-term strategy and funding proposals to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

Mr. President, it is easy to see why earmarking is held so dear to so many of our colleagues who appear to be in a rush to make a personal statement or have an editorial printed in one of the major newspapers in the country without fully understanding the contents of that appropriations bill and the ramifications that will be had by the next committee of the Senate and their future responsibility to hold those responsible for any and all actions in the future accountable for the actions of their colleagues when the next committee of the Senate passes a measure which is so often in need of significant change in its policy that it has to be held up just to make sure that the policy that was sent down from Washington is properly followed.  I am pleased that I have not gotten bogged down with technical corrections in this legislation that were not dealt with during our consideration of the

I want to talk about a couple of issues I think are relevant to this subject and that Vice President Cheney has neglected. I heard this statement: We have no desire to upset the      people of Iraq by unnecessarily increasing pressure on      the government of Iraq, and we would certainly like to      avoid further bloodshed in Iraq if necessary. What does that really mean? It means that the Vice President had a hand in Iraq's takeover

This is the first of a series of measures I have introduced to help end the unfair and unjust discrimination against the more than 12 million veterans of the military who have served their country since the Vietnam war.  As Members of Congress we have a responsibility to show that we care about veterans and to work to ensure that they have the resources they need when they call home for the next 5 years of their service. This bill is an important step in that effort. The act contains a number of important reforms for veterans service organizations such as the One Veterans Home in New Orleans that help veterans find jobs.  I encourage all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation because it addresses the underlying reason that veterans are in need of assistance at the Veterans Benefits Administration, to

The purpose of my amendment is to allow that in some cases to be achieved without any loss of protections for our citizens. Second is to bring to the forefront one of our very real barriers to economic progress that stands out above all others--our Nation's illegal immigration problem. The third goal is to be sure that the United States and our friends around the world are prepared to deal with the migration of people who are then not allowed to send that much more than a letter of intent that should make them very, very much welcome into this country

This legislation would increase the Oklahoma Capital Program by creating the Oklahoma Capital Investment Promotion Agency and would increase the rate of return on federal capital purchases from 4 to 8 percent a year on projects of value over $50 million. This rate of return is an increase of roughly one-half of one percent a year on all capital purchases and would allow the Federal Government to make capital expenditures that are very likely to be of limited use. The Oklahoma Capital Program would be increased to address the limited amount of capital available to the federal government today and would improve the quality of Federal capital investments in the state of Oklahoma.

Mr. President, I am lifting my hold on the nomination of Mr. Jason Klitenic to be a Deputy Secretary of National Treasury in the Executive Office of the President. I do so on behalf of the minority in the Senate and in the House on an amendment I have made to the 1996 budget resolution. The amendment would overturn the President's 2005 budget request to cut the Department of the Treasury in order to fund the President's 2009 budget request for the deficit reduction package for this year. In the 2005 budget request the budget request to $1.6 billion was used to cut the Government by $836 million over 5 years in order to balance the budget in 2009. This year's budget resolution request falls $1 billion short of the President's 2007 budget request for the Department of the Treasury. The $836 million cut in this year's

The grounds for the failure to do this would be that the President said he wanted to do this last year and that there was the signing of the NDAA of April 15, 2006, and that at that time he said the intelligence was wrong and he wanted to fix it, and I do not believe he is asking to do that, and also the fact he wants to help Ukraine and Russia and he said

This important bill would increase the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries and their families by giving it a 50 percent tax cut when it is passed by the House of Representatives and the President signs it into law in the next few weeks. In addition, this bill will provide long-term tax relief for the middle class of this country for the first time in decades and it will also help to improve the ability of seniors to afford prescription drugs for a lifetime of higher medical costs and other services that many people in this country must now face now and in the future. I hope that we will all be able to support this important effort to address the current health care crisis and I look forward to this

Our team has a total of 41 players from the state of Missouri, and the top three finishers earned points in the state team competition and a spot on the State volleyball team.  For this national title this team captured what is one of the highest honors of an individual team from the state of Missouri. The committee members selected 15 girls, four boys and five sophomore girls to represent them in their State volleyball team competition. They won their match by a margin of 5-4 and will go on to compete in the national competition. It is clear that the players represent the best of eastern Hancock High School and it is my honor to congratulate them for this outstanding accomplishment.

Paul is a distinguished career public servant.  Mr. CULLINAN. I thank my colleague from North Dakota.  The CBO says the Senate Budget Committee proposal to spend as much as $300 billion for the war in Iraq is a ``significant'' problem that requires a ``further reconsideration.'' To my mind, it is a grave misperception that the Bipartisan Budget Act or other mandates on the executive branch or congressional committees constitute ``reconsideration.'' To be certain, a reconciliation bill may be necessary before all of the expenditures are made on behalf of our troops, but it is neither a mandate nor should it establish an exception for priorities

Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking about the so-called criminal justice reform bill that has come out of the Rules Committee and the other body. There are a lot of people in this country who are either fearful of crime or feel that they have to do something to curb crime because they cannot get to the crime information center and the police bureau that they need for their crime prevention efforts. If crime was as egregious and as necessary as the bill that passed the House, we could stop crime and I believe there would be bipartisan support for it.  As I listened to the comments made by my colleagues yesterday on the floor of the Senate, I thought of John Madden, a man who became famous as a reporter and general in the Army in the mid-1960's.

Mr. President, as the Republican leadership gavels this session to a close, I am disappointed that we are not able to act on the President's budget and the American people should be given more time to work it through the Congress and before we adjourn this year. If we do not act soon, our Nation could face another fiscal crisis in this Congress. That is why I am supporting the Feingold amendment that would make Federal funding of States' Medicaid programs contingent upon congressional action on the budget. The Senate should pass this amendment to ensure the funding the States receive for Medicaid to meet Federal mandates instead of negotiating with Republicans.  While the Federal budget does not provide for Medicaid, the responsibility for the program, combined with our efforts to combat poverty, is, in my view, the main determinant of whether the Medicaid Program remains solvent.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to continuation of a failed farm policy that is really hurting our farmers, the American farmer, and our farmers and their families.  Farm policy today has been a problem for most farmers from the very first time they were farming land and we have failed to adequately respond to this growing problem as to where our nation is heading and where we are going as a Nation in terms of trying to grow more food and feed hungry people on this Earth. Our policy of money in the system to farm and money not in the country to feed people has not allowed our farmers to keep their family farms and families together and provide for their families and provide for their family values and their children and their children and their families.  Now this administration and this Congress are doing something that I think is morally irresponsible and probably

Mr. President, earlier, we were required and asked to object to a bill being brought before the Senate that would authorize appropriations for military construction at $24 billion through fiscal year 1997 and amendment. The Senate subsequently passed an amendment that would have reduced the authorization to $17.8 billion in fiscal year 1996 from $23 billion in fiscal year 1996. I would have been more than happy to have joined the majority in cutting funds to this program that Congress had not authorized but which we were required to pay for the purposes that have now been served and continue in the future.  However, I now find that the budget resolution and the authorization for this bill were negotiated in a way that does not go into effect the funding that was proposed in the budget resolution. So I cannot support the proposal to increase spending on military construction programs by $1.

Finally, I have one more question for the distinguished Senator from Utah, regarding the changes we have seen in the interest of the minimum wage. I know the Senator has addressed that issue briefly earlier this week and I was curious about whether or not the Senator would discuss that issue with the American people at some point during the debate on this particular amendment before we debate this particular amendment and whether or not he will engage us at that time as to whether or not this minimum wage issue will be brought up at that time as well in that debate.  I think the Senator is right when he said this is probably the most important question the public has asked yet on the minimum wage in the history of the United States. I am wondering if the Senator would say a little bit about the issue of the minimum wage and its place in the history of this

This Federal Reserve decision is not going to have much of an impact on long-term inflation rates in America, which are already very low and the costs of inflation are expected to rise as well as the cost of the mortgage market in the future to even greater levels of growth for the Federal Government.  Yet in spite of all this, you would be hard pressed to find any member of Congress on either side of the aisle today that would support the Fed's massive hike that will cause every American to make short-term changes to their household budgets in order to benefit the Federal Government.

How can this Congress ask Americans to live without health care services when they know what is really going on in Congress to save Medicare?  These are cuts that affect millions of seniors and our future generations. We must never allow Republicans to have any more leverage to be responsible.

He did not say 7 or 6 or 5, he said ``or 5 or 6, but he would like to see us come to a balanced budget in 7 years.''  He then went on to say that his side was getting rather enthusiastic about the fact that he would be able to keep the whole tax cut and inflation pay for itself because of his balancing the budget plan.  But we find that this administration has also put a strong hand in the tax cut as well. Instead of taking away most of the tax cuts for the most wealthy, instead

And if you cut that from their voice, what will it say to the American economy and to the American government that they are not an equal and that they should not be able to stand for justice and equity and common sense and have this stand for the largest corporations in this country?  So I thank my colleague for his remarks.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The

Mr. Speaker, as I watched yesterday's Senate investigations subcommittee hearing, I was disappointed to discover that there is one place the secret for financial fraud and other actions of dubious legality that is never made public. This is the Government Printing Office's total supply of accounting data, and they have been pushing for years for this information to be made public in governmentwide budgets and pay reports to the public.  Since taking over the distribution and management of this accounting data in 1995, the Government Printing Office has forced the GSA to hand over millions of records and documents that cannot be used in any other way because they are so legally illegal. Those records and documents are the only way to track the total financial contributions of foreign nationals to U.S. political candidates and their financial contributions to congressional campaigns, as well as the Congressional Budget Office's so-called

We are all eager to move this bill to the President for his signature and we look forward to a good debate on this important legislation.  It would seem to me it would be a simple matter to say that a Congress can give its approval for the nomination of an executive or judicial official to an agency if there is not a clear conflict of interest or if there is some controversy that has not been fully aired before the President of the United States,

The Federal Government has an unlimited amount of funds that it is allowed to spend in the Federal budget. While no doubt this is a very legitimate Government mandate, it is simply not right for the Federal Government to spend the government dollars on tax breaks for the wealthy or other items. Instead of providing tax breaks to the rich, the Federal Government should be working on ways to increase the financial opportunities for all Americans.  Tax relief should not be a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats both agree tax cuts should be targeted to help the middle-class. The question is, who should it be targeted to help? When

This amendment would make it easier for companies to take advantage of the railroad industry and eliminate the competitive advantages that the industry has to offer onshore oil and gas supplies. This amendment would give away the keys to the railroad industry to the mining industry and put tens of millions of dollars in danger to the continued development of oil and gas resources on our Nation's coastlines.

It is an effort to protect American values and, unfortunately, our actions in Afghanistan have been all too reminiscent of America's involvement in Vietnam.  Madam Speaker, many Democrats have said, ``How can we trust a foreign country with the nuclear weapons we use in Afghanistan? How can we trust a foreign government that kills innocent men, women, and children as a matter of policy and the precedent that that sets?''  Madam Speaker, today I would like to call attention to some of the methods the President and the top brass in Afghanistan employ to direct and control our Nation's policy.

I just want to comment in the strongest possible terms on what we are hearing on the other side of the aisle in regard to campaign finance reform. I don't see this as a partisan issue. What we have to take out of this debate is that we are not having campaign finance reform today or in the future because we are not passing money over from the funds of the Federal Government to the Federal campaign committees and then spending it on the campaigns of those who are elected to Congress. But I will say that I think Senator Smith has spoken very strongly about how the campaign finance reform bill will be implemented. I hope that he will not be in opposition to that particular measure that we are considering today, and I will be talking a little bit later in the afternoon and tomorrow

Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit restores a House priority that had overwhelming support when this legislation was introduced in the 103d Congress to provide needed funds for Bosnia to help stabilize its troubled territory. It is a bipartisan and bicameral effort that will be of great benefit to the country of Bosnia and the United States of America. The passage of this motion to recommit is necessary to clear a path for the funds that will be needed to pay for the humanitarian aid that will be needed to help ensure a successful peace settlement in the area of the former Yugoslavia. I would hope that the full House will support this motion and again pay tribute to a colleague and friend who has been a leader on behalf of American interests and for the interests of the American people.

One way to ensure that no one has this government get to their private, personal files is for Congress to require that agencies act in the interest of information security. However, agencies cannot share that information without appropriate legislative requirements. So, I know of no congressional requirement for agencies to share that information on a routine basis.  This approach is similar to that used when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted in 1978 to protect communications between foreign intelligence officers and intelligence officials outside of the United States, thereby insuring that their personal information was not easily read. Allowing the Federal Government to share this data has been the target of many provisions on this bill

While I am heartened by the strong bipartisan efforts of Senator Schumer and Senator Casey in the Senate, I was disappointed to hear of the Bush administration's effort to throw out the lead-based paint in its legislation on which this legislation is based and to replace it with an American-made lead paint that has a 50 percent lead content, would last 60 years and would cost $1.2

federal trillion tax 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the bill. It puts critical incentives back in the hands of our small business owners by encouraging them to focus their hiring efforts on skilled and qualified workers who will have earned them a good-paying job and will be contributing to the country's economic health. It also encourages job creation by encouraging employers to hire more people. By the way, the bill also has a provision that would allow States to fund grants for job training for disadvantaged youth under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.  Our small businesses are the engines of our economy. In my State of Indiana, the largest employers are small businesses employing 3.5 million people and increasing their gross domestic product by about 2 percent each year. By paying the salaries required to keep our small businesses hiring and building new products, the Federal Government can help

We should work to make sure that the Palestinian leadership is both able and willing to end their occupation and to negotiate a lasting peace with Israel. Instead of helping us to do this, this resolution and the approach to it have been used as an opportunity to promote unworkable and extreme positions that are counterproductive to achieving peace between the parties.

The language in the letter is very simple. The other side is prepared to say that that language is dead simple. It is not. This particular language is very carefully crafted and has been carefully crafted to mean precisely what I object to.

The  about-face comes at the worst time of year for Recordkeeping Act requests by those attempting to sue Federal agencies. Congress has already rejected two lawsuits which seek to overturn decades of agency procedures to keep history clear, as it is now in court in a key ruling of the Supreme Court.  The administration is appealing the decision. But none of this would be required if we adopt the amendments offered by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. The amendments only require that the ruling be reversed and that this issue be resolved in another court if the first court rules in our favor. So they would simply allow

My amendment does not mandate that funds be used for transportation purposes. If funding is designated to transportation-related purposes, it will clearly be approved by the authorizing committee. Further, funds could be used for activities requiring priority funding under the Department of Transportation's Quality Highway Program.  In addition, the amendment would only require that transportation be done that is safe. I believe that this legislation will result in the continuation of funding for roads that will increase safety for the public.

And even though Republicans say they want to keep the program intact, that would mean that a typical family with three kids would be able to no longer get a $4.40 meal a day at a cash only restaurant in a struggling city. Under the House plan, thousands of people would be allowed to go hungry. That means millions more Americans would be hungry and could fall into the ranks of the hungry. They would be the ones getting cuts to emergency nutrition programs like Head Start and much-needed protections for the most vulnerable Americans such as those living with AIDS. They would be the ones getting cuts to education programs and programs to help them find jobs and opportunities.

What are the consequences of all of these changes if implemented by the Federal Government? Poor crop health and decreased returns can result in the loss of critical government funding and possibly even crop insurance jobs for our farmers and our businesses.  This legislation will have devastating economic consequences for the farmers of this Nation who provide our Nation's food and fiber to those who are largely agricultural operations in the country today and who also raise and protect our livestock and our dairy farmers for many of these industries as well.

As a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I find it impossible to believe that this bill would have been passed without the strong support of the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Pryce. This legislation is a good piece of legislation and it is exactly what the Committee on Commerce was going to see and vote for in conference with the Senate, and I strongly support its passage today.  As I travel my district and listen to the stories of the hard working men and women who are responding to our Nation's priorities for our Nation's economic well being and security, I am deeply concerned about the health care that they are experiencing. Members of my Democratic colleagues have spoken about the importance of making health care more affordable and easier for all Americans to

They are not good for the Members of Congress who represent them, but they are a good way to pay for things that we need to do.  I think that is important

Mr. President, it has been a week now since the Republican leadership in the Senate failed to complete action on the Republican tax bill. Now we are talking about making even more business-as-usual in Congress. The New York Times this morning has an excellent article about the Republican tax plan and how the bill will cut Social Security and Medicare benefits by $500 billion. The New York Times tells us that the Republican plan will reduce Social Security and that the bill will cut Medicare benefits by $534 billion over the next 10 years. The Times then says this is the most significant economic change of the last decade and the largest in the history of the American economy and it will also reduce the surplus in the system by billions of dollars. In New York City that is the situation on December 31 of this year, 10 years from now,

Madam Speaker, stopping the tax hike is not just about taxes; it's about jobs. Small businesses are too important to pass up because tax policy is out of whack and because we are not investing in them to create jobs. That is why Speaker Pelosi and I have introduced a job and growth package to pass that means-testing for businesses, the Homeowner Hire, Tax Refund, Small Business Investment, Small Business Tax Relief Act, and a $100,000 tax credit for a married couple and up to $50,000 tax credit for a single person to save $2,500 on housing expenses. And every family should have an option to choose either the taxes being proposed or a tax reduction.  Madam Speaker, we can help reduce our deficit and create more jobs.

The message of the letter of the day to the State of the Union address is a notable example of that which goes around the world.  With the Department of Education programs all across our country honoring Black History Month and our country's history of equality and justice, we should be proud of our past accomplishments and achievements.

So let us not be absolutely certain what that amount is going to be. We are not trying to lay that burden on those children who may grow up to be those hard-working people who today bear the brunt of the unfair tax burden which is now on this Nation, and the fact is that $700 billion a year this country is borrowing this year. We are spending $80 billion a year that we did not expect that we would spend, on school construction alone. And to get this on the floor now, while we are $70 billion short on the last

Mr. Chairman, what troubles me is this legislation creates a Federal express line where the Federal Government will dictate the pace and length of welfare benefits which States will agree to. The Federal Government and the States know that a large share of those benefits are going to go to people who have no dependents. This bill has already taken huge steps to expand that standard to those people who have dependents because it says the State will have to meet that standard and that it is the States which will have to meet that standard if they want to expand the Federal guarantees under the program. But the States will not have to meet that standard if it means they will not expand that standard to those people who have dependents. That is really quite unfair to the Federal Government and unfair to the States.  The problem is that the State has already lost to

Mr. President, as Republicans and Democrats debate the best way to reform health care, Americans expect Americans to see savings in premiums and their health care costs rise for everyone, not just those who can afford it. They also expect us to do everything we can to drive down health care costs and put people back to work. But Republicans and Democrats and American people all expect us to do the same thing without sacrificing their values as consumers and as taxpayers.  For years now, we have talked about these priorities because we all want to help the American people and to help the American economy.  We all want a health care system that delivers a plan that will lower costs for all American families and individuals and improve the quality of health care for our citizens.

So when the Federal Government begins to push the next crop of taxes on employers and on the less fortunate workers who need jobs for the long haul and who need the help of the Federal Government to get them there, we must act now to reduce our deficit. What is so wrong with paying for the services that our Nation's workers have to provide to the public rather than having more government spending that increases the deficit over time and not lowering taxes enough to raise revenues for the government?

I just wanted to get the message out there about that situation as I think the subject of the debate and where it comes down on the issue of whether or not the Congress needs to do what it is supposed to be doing to help the American people understand the process of how this Congress has adopted unfunded mandates proposals which raise some very serious questions about whether or not the Congress ought to be able to bring in money to help in the

Lee Jones worked as a peace officer in Vietnam and a Ranger during the Korean war. After his service, he earned his master's degree from Ohio State University and his law degree from George Washington University.  On August 1, Lee Jones passed away after a bout with pneumonia. His wife, Connie, is still awaiting answers. Our family lost a dedicated man with the American Legion during his service.  Lee Jones helped establish peace in Vietnam, worked as a Ranger and Ranger-in-residence, a GIs liaison officer with the American Legion, and organized the peace peace officers out of Houston.

Mr. President, just very briefly, one of the biggest fights we have had about this bill is that it does not include provisions that would require that the Department of Defense accept additional technologies to make it less vulnerable to act as an unintended agent.  One of the issues that we have had with the Department of Defense is that a number of technologies that they do not recognize may give them the ability to cause a biological or chemical agent to kill, whereas the DOD needs the most modern capabilities to help keep them safe.  The DOD is trying to come to grips with that, but I hope we can pass this bill with the appropriators bringing a compromise.  It is obvious that this issue has divided the administration and divided Congress. I think it is time to act. It should be passed.

First of all, I would like to be clear that we did not say that the reason for this was so that people could be excluded from an insurance program if they had a preexisting condition that caused them to be overweight or in certain cases with a disease that required health care at some time in their lives but did not mean that they would not be able to be covered for those conditions if they were to be in a reasonable and safe environment in the future. What we said was that this should be part of our so-called health care bill because it should not be an excuse for not covering the so-called common good when we had no right to put the kind of limits that would have led to this very action being taken in the first place. That is what the amendment in the bill is trying to do and what

So when we look at all the mandates, the new requirements in the legislation, the one that has been so severely pushed through the Congress in a short period of time is the mandate that one year one out of every seven people who have insurance in this country will be required to pay the entire cost of that insurance. It is called medical liability reform. It is also called the tough-on-crime bill that takes the Federal Government out of the health care system and puts it into criminal law.  And yet if one looks at how the conference report, the Senate has considered this so far, one would conclude that the fundamental real issue that all this health care and the tort reform represents is a war on the poor, a war on the working poor, a war on people who have a higher level of education than the average American,

The cause of this crisis was the President's first trillion-dollar stimulus bill, which was flawed and which was already failing to spur economic growth. It was also so incomplete that it did not contain even the most important provisions that would have made a real difference to make our economy better.

It is the kind of thing that makes us question the integrity of our Government and the way in which we go about the business of America. This $500-per-child tax credit, this $50 billion for kids, will hurt so many children who rely on it in trying to get to school every day, trying to work, trying to get a good start

Mr. Chairman, a very wise former Governor of Indiana once said that you will never get a turkey in a pie with more eggs than the people of Iowa and Louisiana. And I agree with the former Governor, and I know the gentleman has been at this issue for many years and has worked very hard to try and bring a solution to this problem. It is a matter of principle for many States in the Union to make it an entitlement program. The chairman of the Budget Committee has recognized the difficulty the gentleman has had in getting such a program as I think is a first step.  I am pleased the gentleman recognizes the point of order that he made against an amendment that he had offered earlier in the debate.   Sailor V. Chambliss. I oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona.

Mr. President, as he has done numerous times over the past 10 years, Senator Bumpers of Florida has been an outstanding Senator in many ways, but most notably in his support for veterans' health care as a cornerstone of any health care reform bill he has brought to the Senate in this past year.  The first year of President Clinton's health care reform legislation was marked by widespread and painful victories for the veterans and for the Nation's businesses, many of which still suffer from some of the results of the initial failings of the Clinton administration's efforts to overhaul our health care system.  At the same time, the health care reform bill leaves behind, it seems, an ever-growing gap between what businesses and veterans in our communities and throughout the Nation really need to provide for their families.  That is a shame. It is a shame

The critical threat to our Nation in the post-cold-war environment of nuclear security has become more than a high-technology challenge for government and industry. The Department of Energy now has the largest nuclear stockpile of any government in the world. For the past two decades it has been the United States' leading nuclear nonproliferation player.

Americans want to increase the safety and security of our Nation's highways and waterways by investing in infrastructure, rather than policies that will further increase our country's debt and hurt job creation and growth. Americans want to protect the environment by eliminating the costly and important energy industry subsidies that fuel our energy dependence and increase our dependence on foreign oil and increase our dependence on foreign oil for our Nation's national security and national prosperity. America needs to create jobs and spur economic growth to increase our demand for energy so we will not need foreign oil when

Mr. President, it is especially appropriate for members of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to discuss Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sotomayor will fill the vacancy that was created by the retirement of Justice Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Sotomayor is the only Supreme Court nominee with a judicial philosophy that reflects Sotomayor's background as an attorney before the Supreme Court. As Justice Sotomayor was nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1991, her upbringing in Atlanta was supplemented by that of a teacher, an attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, and a law clerk for the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Justices throughout our Nation have benefited from her willingness to give the law a shot at interpretation and

It is always appropriate to ask the authorizing committee what it thought of the program in which funding was provided for a particular program to the House or to the Senate and the authorizing committee to report back to the authorizing committee so we can make an informed decision that there was adequate funding in the committee authorization for the program in which it was provided for to meet the needs of the American people in the year 2002 and beyond.

The other provisions in the Bunning amendment can reduce or reduce more funding for areas of State fiscal responsibility.

While it is true that Iraq does not have enough troops to sustain operations in that country for 2 years, this amendment simply would make the arbitrary stop of troops in that country indefinitely, thereby increasing the costs of maintaining troops in Iraq. It has been pointed out that 1 year is a large enough period of time to put our troops in a state of emergency and to have significant financial costs associated with it.  Moreover, military commanders do not have direct authority to prevent troop deployment from Baghdad. The ability to request and take corrective action is part of the Commander in Chief's responsibility under Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of extending MFN trading status with China and in opposition to the Republican leadership's amendment which would block the Export-Import Bank from opening new credit markets in China.  I believe that we should be working together on a more serious deal with China that will achieve the primary objective of opening new markets for Chinese products to the United States market. But rather than closing existing markets for Chinese products that are not important to the United States, we should be making them open up for new markets that are important to the trading interests of the United States.  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have proposed a provision that would allow the creation of new markets for the People's Republic of China that would increase the Chinese market for American goods and services in the United States by adding one new Canadian

The alternative offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox] was a bad idea and he took it out in the process of the agreement that we made with the Senator from Alaska on the understanding that I would take the risk to offer this amendment if that particular amendment had not been adopted and did so in a much better way than what was offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Cox] and his other colleagues.

Because the administration said we have to have doctors and nurses and other health professionals in there because we cannot do it our way in this way or in other ways if we want to have health care reform. Why do you not take what the nurses say about it and put it in the form of a law, even if it is not working. Then we would have people who have a very good chance of being able to get health care who would take the best benefit of it if they went with their doctor and their staff doctor and they worked and they had that staff working.

Mr. President, Senator Exon's amendment to restore $15 billion in agricultural spending is a step in the right direction. This funding will help small farmers and ranchers gain access to their capital as well as higher cost of living benefits and better credit. Americans are demanding that their tax dollars be spent in a more responsible and cost-effective manner. The money the Exon amendment would spend on agriculture is much needed and we are well past the point of no return at this point in time with our fiscal policies. All of us on the other side of the aisle agree that we must do more to address the trade deficit that we have with China and the overproduction and the manipulation of this global economy. These concerns do not belong in the budget or anywhere else in our budget. That is why I think that we must support the Exon amendment which

That is why I believe it is a most important time to consider both measures and support their passage this year.  Last Congress, the House and Senate increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs by $3.8 billion to support needed programs for veterans in our Nation's hospitals and programs that provide support for the families of veterans who have been injured while serving our country in the military. That was done to assist those veterans who were not able to receive health care benefits during the war on terror because

Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution gave the executive branch of our Government authority to determine the values that citizens of the United States believe to be the most important. But if it means imposing these values on the Nation, then the executive branch must have the authority to do so. In fact, I am concerned that we are dangerously lacking in that authority today. The President has been granted more power and authority under the Constitution than any president in history in terms of the power and authority to implement policy. Not only that, but the more power the President has over the executive branch, the more he is free to implement policies that were not previously subject to congressional oversight or even to the approval of the House of Representatives.  This is not good for the Nation or for the Government.  A recent Supreme Court decision said that executive power

But as the Senator's chart demonstrates, if you adjust that for inflation, what your GDP would have to increase by is about $10,000 a year to maintain current levels of income and costs that you would have to pay tax on those increased costs. So I think it is appropriate to set up a process whereby you can adjust your rates of income and expenditures relative to what the cost of inflation would be in the country as it relates to higher taxes because that is really what this is all about, if you will. But as we know, the cost of raising taxes is much higher than the cost of just reducing the overall tax rate because if we increase the rate we increase the percentage of total income of the population. That is what the effect would be on your income and the relative cost of things if you raise taxes enough to do that

Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, we can still work an omnibus bill, and we can still bill it out. In fact, I am committed to that; that is the policy I have always promoted. But to say a bill will not be out next week is sort of like saying someone you have just met is not as intelligent as you think they are.  There is not an omnibus bill that I have not written. So I would say, Madam Speaker, that without being absolute certainty about the next couple of days, we cannot pass a short-term bill without something for June or July, something for September, something for October, something for November, something for December, something for January or February, something for March, nothing, and we could not pass a short-term bill without some kind of extraneous business.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act (H.R. 2670) as it is today before us for the same reasons I have previously stated. I was first to join the many opponents of the Deep Ocean Resources Act last year to oppose this legislation because it would allow the United States to export noxious, toxic, or harmful deepwater drilling from many U.S. waters in an area that does not have any drilling or potential for drilling, including in New England, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Rhode Island.  The overall climate change issue is the issue we should be talking about and we should be addressing, and we need to do everything we can to have an energy policy that will help to curb climate change.

Iran has been the latest to respond to the war and Iranian-backed terrorist groups are now trying to help support and direct the attack on Lebanon and its civilian population. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is also now insisting on staying out of the conflict, but Iran and Saudi Arabia want nothing to do with either party, and that puts them in a difficult situation, both in terms of the pressure they are currently under, and also the danger of an Israeli strike.  The country of Lebanon is less than 2 years old, and the Lebanon Government has been working diligently in trying to resolve this conflict peacefully.

Neil is a Republican, and the hard work of hardworking Republicans like the Speaker of the House is to support the Judiciary Committee and confirm judicial nominees when a Democratic President and Democratic Senate are in the White House and in Congress.  The House of Representatives has the ability to do just that. That is why we need to do our job and confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court of the United States.

It has to be done to make sure that the tax laws are paid for and that they get back to the taxpayers and not be asked to pay any more of them in taxes in the future than they pay now for services that they have provided. So to say this bill is going to have no effect on what we do and what we make available for the people of the United States because this will not actually go into effect, I think is a very dangerous approach that we ought to take to protect our own tax laws and those that are our rules of the road because they are the laws that determine where

Mr. Speaker, the last part of this exchange that the gentleman from Virginia had before was in October 1996 when we had an election in North Carolina. I was a part of the election that the gentleman from Massachusetts had because in that election the Democrats said the working men and women in this country, Republicans in this country, could not afford the higher taxes that the President had in 1997 and 1998 that he had proposed to put on the working people of this country.  Now he goes on to say the same thing in September 1994 and April 1995 when the Democrats were in the majority in this House, September 1994 in April 1995. And the same thing goes on

Yes. My colleague states the obvious. It is when you get that first set of tax cuts in the form of a stimulus package in the form of money coming out of your States that we can really see some results. We see some steps forward for the cause of small business in the Nation. This bill does make some significant steps forward in that regard. One is the top income tax bracket for income over $1 million is gone, although we still have this enormous dividend tax increase which is going to result in that $1 million dollar tax rate going to be as high as 70 percent for that $1 million dollar income. If you think that is a lot of money coming out of your pocket for that kind of income that you are trying to level for your kids and for your families, you cannot imagine what this means to those families

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. Twelve years ago striped bass stocks in Rhode Island were close to being wiped out. The stock is still healthy and thriving, but the loss of this species is a reality.  We all have the same world view of fishing as hunting and recreational recreation, and striped bass is a testament to that notion. For many people it was a fishing season for many of our children and grandchildren. Yet striped bass has been in the Eastern Atlantic for over half a century, only 3 years longer than the 17 years it was supposed to last. This particular species is one of a handful in the entire Atlantic where the coastal zone is highly stressed. We must be in close and far reach of this one and use all of our resourceful oceanians in the most practical and effective way possible.  I

In a report to be released this week that we will receive this evening from the Department of Education on education funding, the New Direction for Education for All states that the Federal Government should do more to provide resources to low-income families, particularly those families with children in urban areas where 60 percent of the children in poverty are children. This funding is needed to help more disadvantaged children.  Unfortunately, there are not enough dollars allocated for assistance to the thousands of our Nation's communities that suffer from significant poverty. This is a budget point of order that Congress has the responsibility to rectify. It's time for Congress to fix this problem. It's time for the Federal Government to

This legislation will implement the administration's Initiative on East-West Energy and at the same time reduce the risk of a disruption of the current and future energy supply for Israel and the United States in order to advance our vital regional interests. The bill would require the State Department to review all U.S. trade and other agreements with Israel for areas of mutual interest and require the Department to submit a report to Congress within a year about the effects of such a review on American oil and gas and other foreign policy interests.  The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act seeks to bridge the gap between the United States and the Israeli Government in order to assist Israel in its effort to promote energy security for the United States and for the

This bill would bring much needed professional development to the workplace and to employees of our Federal Government.  On January 27, 2005, the Government Accountability Office conducted a review of these issues and found that Federal employees have significant needs in managing their own finances and seeking jobs that pay a living wage. Indeed, in the year 2000, only about 18 percent of employees with jobs with benefits were actually paid a living wage as required by law. While the Department of Labor now supports this requirement that 50 percent of employees work at or below the Federal poverty level for a family of three and that they pay no more than minimum wage for food and

The amendment of the Senator from Utah would provide a Federal role for local and State governments and Federal agencies in that work. It does not go further than the committee proposal which I believe that a good and balanced effort could be made to meet the needs of our States and localities if local government had full and effective control of planning and funding, rather than Federal agencies which would be the ones who would drive local planning and the planning on behalf of Federal agencies in those State and local governments.

Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2007 and the reforms that it will bring about to the way the Federal Government does business. The bill before us today will enhance public services to all Americans by limiting the overregulation of the federal regulatory system that results in increasing costs to the Federal Government and job losses to small business. This bill also will provide for a more efficient and effective Federal Government that puts Americans first. For too long the Federal Government has overregulated the Federal marketplace and has required the Federal Government to spend so much time and money administering Federal programs that they have become impossible to run and effectively run without creating regulatory and court battles. It has been said that Federal regulations and court battles have been over $200 billion over the last 30 years, and the American people must

solution president democrats 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, yesterday President Trump and Republican leaders once again tried to sit down with President Obama and Democrats to try to reach a solution to our country's health care crisis. Yesterday, the President threatened to veto the health care bill even though his own administration recommended it last year.  Republicans and the White House tried to work together for months on the Senate bill, but the White House ultimately abandoned the negotiations after facing obstruction from many of their own members.  During a discussion of the Senate bill yesterday, Secretary Mnuchin said he and the President need to focus on health care costs. When pressed, Secretary Mnuchin indicated that premiums are not a problem and would go down if Republicans have the kind of comprehensive reform Democrats want.  The chairman of the Small Business Committee wrote yesterday to Secretary Mnuchin and asked him to expand on the statements

We need to increase and increase and increase their benefits and veterans programs and help provide for their security and defense at the same time. I have opposed this bill several times and, after doing so this year, it was the same time that I offered my amendment to increase veterans funding by $700 million in this budget resolution.
