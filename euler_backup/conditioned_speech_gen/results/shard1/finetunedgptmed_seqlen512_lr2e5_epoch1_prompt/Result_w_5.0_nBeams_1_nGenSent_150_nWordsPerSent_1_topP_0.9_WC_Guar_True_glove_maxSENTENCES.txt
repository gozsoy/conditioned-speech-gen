Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states that the Bureau of Reclamation will be required to make grants to the environmental technology demonstration projects which use environmental technologies to achieve basic criteria in order to receive Federal contracts under the West Muddy Watershed Program or the Transfer of Water Program. What these environmental technology demonstration projects involve is working together with groups of local communities in certain elements of the West Muddy Watershed Program to upgrade sewer infrastructure, to improve water treatment systems, and to obtain research and demonstration contracts for transmission and distribution projects. These environmental technology demonstration projects are important to providing Federal dollars to meet Federal water quality objectives and environmental quality standards.  In many instances, these projects have already demonstrated their value. This bill simply reaffirms that these projects and its intended application, the Clean Water Act,

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I believe are serious problems with the current Medicare plan and real consequences for those who have chosen to stay on Medicare.  On May 8, 2008, I submitted legislation that would allow doctors to keep charge-free health care coverage for those who abuse Medicare. This bill is necessary because there is a demand in this country to prevent abuse of Medicare and to save it for our future generations to benefit from health care reform legislation that would bring reform to the amendment system. This process is not easy. The approval of this legislation has taken almost two years. I have been to a number of hearings in various committees on Medicare and I have not always been comfortable with the evidence presented at hearings. Nonetheless, I was pleased to work with Senators Harkin, Thune,

It is not right to allow the Congress to rewrite the law to bring people into it by making provisions of the law more generous. Let us look at what they did yesterday.  They did a corporate tax cut that takes 10,000 families to over $9,000, and they allowed an add-on on that to the total corporate tax cut to $10 billion to balance the budget and pay for the corporate tax cut.

Mr. Speaker, I applaud President Trump on including $13 million for widening and deepening the Bucks River in the new National Historic Trail in my home state of West Virginia. This one of the most important projects in the history of the National Historic Trail will help to highlight the monthlong year-long White House summer vacation which the President has proclaimed National Historic Week.  The Speaker and I worked in a bipartisan manner on these projects. For example, I cosponsored the West Virginia Building and Loan Act to award WVBG Federal loan guarantees of $1.3 million for this project.  As we celebrate the renovation of this beautiful historic site, I want to thank President Trump for including $13 million in this contract.  With that, I urge passage of the bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kyl and Robb, I offer an amendment which requires that the President of the United States appoint three foreign policy advisers to the United States in consultation with the administration of the United States Congress and require that the staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee be allocated such an office.  This amendment would ensure that a national policy will be established for future administration officials to plan for and consult with their Cabinet officials, to communicate with those abroad, and to utilize Congress' interests and priorities.  The U.S. election in 2000 was a clear indication that a political leader is committed to working in good faith with the people in the United States to preserve the liberty and economic independence of the people of the United States.

This commemoration of the Armenian genocide serves as a call to uphold all human rights that we as Americans hold dear, especially those in the Armenian community, where Armenians and Greeks are among the most famous communities of Christians.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. The additional funding requested for Colombia is necessary to support military activities in the country. The recent rise in anti-American violence is a direct result of U.S. involvement in Colombia's conflicts against the pro-U.S. and pro-U.N. government forces of the Andean Free Trade Union movement and the real-life guerrilla war waged by Colombia's left-wing paramilitaries. The increased activity that this country now hosts forces a vulnerability to terrorism and violence, and I am all for our military involvement in Colombia if we can help. However, this amendment clarifies that this funding would not go toward paying for Colombia's military operations, but rather would go toward funding for trade relations in those areas in which U.S. foreign policy activities take place.

And as this debate unfolds, the Court's decision in Marbury v. Madison will still apply to a large part of our immigration laws.

It requires a technical waiver of the requirements to amend it so that it could be voted on by the House today and would be without any need for a point of order under the rules of the House today and would not be put up for a vote today because we would have it done today so that we could have it done today so we could actually do something else things on this floor that is actually going to do something for children and the economy and what needs to be done in spending.  If we do that, then we will do a lot more for children, and I think we can at least have children and invest in the economy and do the things that are actually going to do good for children in this country.

Mr. President, today for the second week in a row the Senate Judiciary Committee's agenda is to consider legislation that would put constitutional protections on our electoral system. Now Congress has a bill before us that would undermine the constitutional amendment defining the rules of our electoral process. The Senate Judiciary Committee has been working on this legislation for months and it has become clear that the legislation it is now bringing before the Senate would undermine the nature of our most important election process: the all-or-nothing Snowe amendment.  As my colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, pointed out, this is the very same Senator who drafted and introduced in 2000 the legislation that would declare the exclusion of national elections from the provisions of the 14th amendment to the Constitution. What he saw as a unqualified denial of the separation of powers meant that it would threaten the integrity of

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment of the gentleman from California [Mr. Beilenson], the chairman of the committee and to state for the record that I think that Federal Government programs should comply with the requirements of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the laws governing the payment of agency employees. It is a fact that Federal programs have tended to underpay employees because Federal regulations, having not been developed by employees, force those employees to comply with arbitrary workplace standards of paid and unpaid performance. This causes the Federal Government to have lost jobs and to have refused to provide the salaries to its employees. Furthermore, Federal regulations have discouraged job creation by forcing Federal workers to perform jobs that they have been ordered to perform. It is for this reason that Members on both sides

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, that is not what the Constitution says. The Constitution says, that if we send a bill to the President or send a bill to a Member of Congress for consideration, the first consideration that it shall have is of the members of the Congress of the United States that have the proper compensation and the appropriate benefits to be earned and for which that benefits should be provided.  The only reason why we would see a highway program, for example, is that one member of that committee or that one congressional district would benefit from it, as well as the entire Congress of the United States, or the entire country. We do not know that there are people throughout the country that are going to benefit from this for themselves or for their children. We have tried to give the States the flexibility to do that.

Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Medicare trustees--three of whom are members of the President's Cabinet and a former House majority leader--announced their conclusion that Medicare cuts will bankrupt the Medicare system. In doing so, the trustees failed to foresee the Medicare beneficiary, the Federal budget deficit, the Medicare crisis that is presently spreading like a boomerang from one region to the other, to the individual physician's family or to the State.  I have been a long-time supporter of Medicare and a strong advocate of strengthening the program to achieve full payment in the new decade. But the trustees' report is anathema to me because the Medicare solvency crisis is not new and has not progressed in a decade. In fact, it is a product of decades of reduced Federal spending and increased premiums. In the 1960's, Congress sent hundreds

I want to be clear that I think many of those individuals who oppose this continued failed farm policy are in the process of collecting the greenbacks they have earned while the family farmers are trying to make ends meet. But that is not the real reason I support this alternative proposal. I want to focus on the dire effects of the current farm policies.  The 2008 Farm Bill decreased over 600,000 acres of production and approximately 1 million acres of farm land out of the national forest system.

I would hope, though, that we would deal with this matter in conference and set some precedence on which that will have to be done.

Mr. President, today I speak in support of the Cotton amendment to the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act to provide information regarding the security of Federal agencies and government information systems.  The Federal Government operates an Information Sharing and Analysis Program with the private sector for the purpose of sharing information with other government agencies and the private sector and providing access to those who work in secret and in sensitive locations to more comprehensive and timely intelligence gathering. The efforts of the Federal Government to provide real-time, real-value intelligence to those on the front lines has continued as a threat to the Nation's security. Our Nation has made enormous progress in the fight against information warfare and threats to our privacy, but the Federal Government's most recent cyber security threat has come from an attack on its critical infrastructure.

Now, I understand the difference, and I appreciate the difference, but I find it quite difficult to believe that there is a disincentive to be a pro-Clinton candidate.

Mr. President, I yielded for the question. I would say this: Before the Senator from New Mexico came down and spoke on this bill to say it will increase the cost of health care to senior citizens and all the other nonsense he has done to the bill that is before us that would increase the cost of health care to the average senior citizen who is able to work the way we want to work for a resolution that comes in support of that conference report. But he did not bring up any statistics that yielded any proof that it will result in a decrease in the number of seniors who will have to work. He has told us--and the Senator from West Virginia has testified and told us--that he does not know how this will affect him. We cannot tell you how the Senator from New Mexico does.

These programs are supposed to allow qualified individuals who teach in disadvantaged areas to earn more than they could without public assistance.

Under the order in combat the Senator from Idaho has two minutes of each side, I believe that would be allowed.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 is intended to close loopholes in the Iran Sanctions Act that were made possible by the legislation before us today and make it even more difficult for the Government of Iran to obtain funding for terrorism in the United States. This legislation is an important legislation that Congress must pass now to hold Iran to the terms of Senate concurrence and ultimately success in its international nuclear weapons program.  I have for the last few years been working to secure additional sanctions relief for Iran so that we can continue to enforce U.N. Security Council resolutions regarding Iran's compliance with the interim and permanent international community resolutions. The Iranian Government's reckless pursuit of a nuclear weapon and its repeated practice of making violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions and violating international law are simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

Madam Speaker, today is the eighth anniversary of American involvement in Afghanistan. America will soon be there for another 17 years. America's military presence in Afghanistan has raised many troubling challenges for the Afghan people, including safety of women and children,, poor access to health care and education, and--frankly--many things that were one-sided.  Today, I wish to recognize the tremendous military successes and help improve the Afghan Government, provide security and stability in that region of the world, while at the same time providing a better environment for families, children, and the Afghan people.  I think about what it was like to be a child growing up in Afghanistan. This country had absolutely no role in it. We are one country. There was no dictatorship there.

Mr. President, agencies issue probably thousands of rules each year that pertain only to one of the agencies involved in the rulemaking process. Each agency determines that it is within its jurisdiction to issue the rule but that they will issue the rule in consultation with the legislative branch. Therefore, the legislative branch issues the rule when both the administration and the congressional leadership are informed that it is routine for the agency to issue a rule for a particular basis.  These rules that the agencies issue are considered a bar to the goal of Federal regulation. Since the rule is issued in consultation with the legislative branch, the Congress has an obligation to report back to Congress on the process and feasibility of adopting the rule. This report would serve to further discuss the considerations on which it is being based. It would provide for the consideration of the role of the Congress and

I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman knows, the IRS practices unique under-and-overclass tax rulings in that they exempt some of their individual taxpayer groups from their corporate taxes for tax reasons and they require them to pay income taxes to them in many cases and they have one income tax for families, not one income tax per taxpayer. So the taxpayers are forced to put off paying those taxes until their next income tax payment, which, for some taxpayers, can be as much as $100 billion a year.

Mr. Chairman, the budget neutral Bereuter amendment restores the $25,160,000 to the current funding level in this appropriation for a program which is not receiving Federal funds and which receives no support from the administration and should not be receiving assistance.  The Bereuter amendment only cuts $4 million from the Red River Demonstration Project, which is one of only two States which have received Federal funds for the V-II III water transportation projects. This additional funding is requested because most of the funding for the new water routes over the next several years will come from other regional federal grants, as well as from funds that are already authorized in the bill for Water-Rivers, and is not fully offset, in my judgment.  I am very concerned about the loss of this funding. Since the program was authorized in 1973, it has received $4.7

Madam Speaker, stopping the tax hike is not just about taxes; it's about jobs. Small businesses have the largest tax base, so it's difficult to raise taxes on them. Americans deserve to know if the Democrat priorities are paid for. We'll have to see.  However, there is a silver lining to the Clinton tax hike that is very real. In Kansas, the Reagan and Bush tax cuts did not kill jobs. In fact, the Reagan tax cuts created the dumbest economy in history. Our economy is better off for Reagan's tax cuts, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, Madame Speaker, it's about time that we find some solutions to real problems like deficit reduction and reduce the debt.  Madam Speaker, the Clinton tax hike is a tragic burden on American families. It's going to cost nearly 9 million Americans

Mr. Speaker, I have opposed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy since its inception in 2005 and have never voted for it as a result of this and other reasons including because I believe there are many people that will actually support the policy that allows gay men and lesbians to serve our country and our families and our country does not discriminate against those same people that do not want to be treated that way. Therefore, I oppose harmful anti-gay statements that have been made that have caused further wounds on our gay men and lesbians in the military and from other people.  I voted against the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy because I believe it disproportionately impacts men and women of color, military families and, as a result, whether a person can serve their country in the military. This policy, which allows a transgender servicemember, disproportionately

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. In the Republican budget, we now have another $800 billion in the welfare reform bill that the President will sign.  In the Republican budget that Chairman Taylor and I introduced this year, we added a provision that was intended to combat the money used to pay California's bills to fund welfare. Instead, the money that is being funneled to California comes from a whole new set of programs, some of which are paying for all of the existing problems the Republicans are working to solve, and this is a subsidy that many taxpayers are supporting to this day.  So we have created this provision to prevent this cost from getting passed on to hardworking taxpayers in California.  I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to this in the House.

The fact is if you have a family and a man works 40 years and invests all his time and all his effort and his resources in a savings account, that one man or woman, that small business owner, would get his or her share of the tax savings when the individual returns.

So in effect it takes money from the States and provides it for a commercial insurance market which means that, in effect, the States will lose something.

Mr. Speaker, as summer turns towards winter, the American people will continue to face high prices for heat and energy while the economy continues to decline. The lack of funds to increase energy efficiency and renewable energy is making our domestic economy more dependent on foreign sources of energy such as oil and coal. Rising demand for energy creates lower prices at the pump, resulting in additional energy prices to our consumers. Higher costs for American consumers have the opposite effect and this presents an escalating strain on Rita's ability to serve our Nation's consumers.  Earlier this month, the Energy and Commerce Committee passed S. 455, the Energy Information Administration's 2017 energy report. S. 455 provides additional funding for Rita. This supplemental funding was necessary to help ensure the continued timely delivery of the energy supplies that the West uses and markets for at the international market. During this

That message is that the House of Representatives is failing in its responsibility to bring a resolution to the floor for final ratification of the Senate tax bill before the year is out and that this is what should be done.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lemanuel ``Lee'' Jones, who passed away on the Fourth of July. Jones was born in Oak Grove, Texas, in 1950. He graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio and the University of Alabama in 1974, and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1979 with a B.S. in foreign service and Vietnam Studies.  Mr. Jones' work abroad began during his service in the U.S. Air Force, and he then started his distinguished career at the World Bank and was promoted to the position of Assistant Secretary for Development Cooperation, International Development, and Energy Policy for Global AIDS, where he served for 6 years. Mr. Jones then returned to the Department of the Treasury and did a stint in the Rockefeller Institute for International Economics and Management, where he was the Senior Director for

Mr. President, just very briefly, one of the biggest fights we have had about this legislation was our efforts to stop the President of the United States from being able to do his job and make the laws we passed as part of the act in the way that they were passed. So if there is something he wants to do and does not want to do bill-by-bill, he can do it and act on it. But this bill would put into place, over a period of time, the authority of the entire judicial branch to pick the judge and the criminal process in a particular case, to go through it and to decide on that judge and send it to the President for signature.  The Senator from Washington wanted to stop that kind of judicial pick-and-choose of the court system. I say to my colleagues that

So when we look at all the mandates, the new requirements in the legislation, the new taxes and the mandates in the law for a good few months last year, how many months does it take for the Federal Government to enforce a bill passed by Congress?   Kessler at the Congressional Budget Office reported on November 4, 2003: Taking the average time of 3 months to make up a $260 billion tax cut weighed more on a company's bottom line than did making up the $269 billion cost to implement new mandates that the Federal Government imposes. So just in the last 3 months alone, with the new regulations in the law that we passed last year, the CBO estimates that Congress will actually spend up to $400 billion more than it takes in just in this year, 1.4 years of the average tax cut.

This is important information for Congress to receive, so the recipient of counterfeit money must remain vigilant in the fight against fraudulent activities. The approach taken by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, FinCEN, to investigate financial institutions and financial services providers for potential fraud has undoubtedly improved this approach by requiring financial institutions to establish and maintain an interagency database that includes a process for action by the enforcement agency.

Mr. Speaker, fixing our Nation's crumbling infrastructure to boost the economy and increase transportation safety is vital to increasing employment and economic growth in my home state of New Jersey and the Nation. Recently, we have seen over 1 million construction jobs lose their jobs in New Jersey due to massive safety issues that plague our Nation's infrastructure. The Republican tax increase only makes this worse by increasing costs for homeowners and businesses that will create an economic boost for those working in the construction industry as well as jobs for themselves and for their families when they put that first mortgage down on their house.  Democrats have a partisan solution to fixing our Nation's infrastructure and this bill will strengthen our economy in New Jersey and across our Nation by reauthorizing existing critical infrastructure projects, extending tax credits and improving the transparency and accountability of major infrastructure investments.

I don't oppose raising taxes; in fact, I am for it. When the money in the budget is held up or when the administration does its heavy lifting, then we have to make some sacrifices to get the job done, but we should not drag the American people into this dangerous and ill-advised battle over whether we should repeal or not repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare, or raise taxes on millions of Americans in order to fund it.

Mr. President, I am pleased to support the confirmation of Judge Stephen Breyer for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Stephen is a law graduate and trial judge, and he has experience on the federal bench, in both the first circuit and the DC Circuit.  While I would have preferred that Judge Breyer has chosen to serve as a federal district judge, this nomination clearly demonstrates his commitment to the rule of law, the respect of his colleagues, and the continued practice of respecting the constitutional separation of powers.  I am pleased that Judge Breyer has chosen to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. In my view, the current paradigm of judicial procedure in America leads to judicial activism and is detrimental to the institution of the judicial branch.  I believe Judge Breyer has also shown himself to be able to

But China is not a part of this agreement yet and this agreement will only make it more likely that it will be negotiated with the full agreement being negotiated with other countries in this agreement for deals that it should not require the United States to sign on the table. In other words, our existing laws will be ignored.  While much debate has been about what the United States' role in trade is with China, our markets are out of reach to China for many things. For example, we have lost nearly $100 billion in trade with China over the past several years due to some of our trading practices. Our environmental laws are out of reach

Mr. President, Senator Exon's amendment to restore $15 billion in agricultural spending is a step in the right direction for American families who need the tax cut the most but who desperately need it most in the short term. The spending levels in the Exon amendment are within the President's budget request and will help Americans respond to the terrible news of the ``farm crisis.''  More importantly, the restoration in agriculture spending will help more families and families at greater risk of losing their farms. Those are the only families in this country who will be better off with a tax cut rather than with a real safety net.  The Senate Agriculture Committee will begin to look closely at this issue as we consider a farm bill conference report later this week.

Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution gave the executive branch of our Government authority to make emergency and statutory declarations of war against our enemies without Congress ever having authorized the President to do so. That authority continues today. It should be expanded and exercised only if there is an imminent threat to the American people and Government from foreign powers or a danger to the security of the United States itself.  Executive discretion should not be precluded from seeking to assist our foreign adversaries. The President may make direct and affirmative actions to retaliate against enemies of the United States, including those who engage in military aggression against our ally, in international conflict against our ally, or to enforce American law.  Executive authority should not, in any way, limit our use of such authorities or our exercise of that authority.  It is, therefore, my hope that

As someone who has seen firsthand the tremendous hardships that many Hispanic families in California are facing, I know just as we did when I was first elected to the California State Senate that many people in my home State have been a part of that problem in many different ways as well as now as today as the example of the character and the courage of women in your district in Central Valley who we are so proud of today as one of the so many who participated in Vietnam, who participated in Korea and now have been with us as we strive to bring to the attention of the American people and the world the extreme and senseless persecution that so many who are illegal immigrants are inflicting on people who cannot speak English, and in many

Madam Speaker, Iranians and Saudis are uniting to try to avoid a war in Lebanon. Iran is pressing ahead to build a nuclear weapon, sending Iran a message that Iran will not abandon its nuclear ambitions. Iran has clearly taken the Iranian decision to play by the rules and remain a state sponsor of terrorism seriously.  Saudi Arabia has taken a similar step and has too. It is up to us here in Congress to stand up for them and hold them accountable if we stay silent. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I take the floor today to talk about March because March is the month in which college costs have gone up more than one dollar over the past 2 years. In fact, as of this writing this week more than half the students in the Nation are enrolled in the latest Federal programs requiring them to pay more than $4 billion to care for someone who is not yet a family member of their own family. This is a story that Americans have known for years and they have been watching it happen with growing alarm. This fact has been portrayed in the media as being the role of institutions of higher learning, those schools where students and faculty and students are expected to take responsibility and who have been negligent in educating students to reach their fullest potential.  I want to talk specifically about three programs that can't be cited as a failure

Mr. President, I am pleased to see President Trump's clarification today. The Russians did meddle in the 2016 election, and the administration has effectively ignored this reality. For years now, Congress and the President have worked to strengthen our Constitution, which has made it much harder for foreign actors to hack into American elections or influence our voting. I am very proud that President Trump has finally stated clearly that the only thing we should do as a nation is do what is necessary to protect our character as a nation.  Now that we are dealing with the fallout of the Trump administration's interference in our elections, I think it is important that we realize that the elections that our country lost were not the work of Vladimir Putin. Rather, this act of hacking was done by a foreign adversary. The entire process has been delayed, made worse, and it has

Although this group was not involved in any significant military action prior to this time due to the actions of their submarines and the lack of knowledge of these different groups about each other that result from being separated for so long, I think we all know what was at stake here.  The U.S. Navy was in the midst of a battle with Japanese forces. Many of the 200 sailors who were in this battle were from my home State, and so we had a two-sport commitment. After the

I also think this has a unique situation in the committee because in 1996, the VA, when the President asked for a $500 million increase for VA, decided to start outsourcing the hiring of veterans' health care professionals so that VA could hire more lawyers, nurses, and other service providers to handle its employees' court cases.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO alliance to include Romania and Bulgaria. I support an expansion of NATO to Romania and Bulgaria because both Romania and Bulgaria have demonstrated a desire to uphold our common values and a commitment to NATO at the highest level. Romania and Bulgaria have also demonstrated strong efforts to meet and better integrate Hungary and Bulgaria.  Romania and Bulgaria have long suffered from corruption, inefficiency, and lack of economic and legal independence.

There are a lot of things in the tax law that are not great on big corporations and the other side is the last one that is one of the most discriminatory laws that the country has ever known in the tax law that we have ever had passed here in the House of Representatives in the last 20 years because property, State, and local tax liability, and our debt is enormous. I see many Democrats on the other side that come from blue States that cannot comprehend all the deductions and all the very complicated things that are in this country.

My Democratic friends on the other side of the aisle were willing to work with the President and Democrats on DACA to fix DACA, and the President's record on protecting Dreamers--while insufficient--represented the clear priorities of the Republican Party. Democrats stood with Democrats and did what we should have done when he last tried this.

I urged my colleagues to support it because in this year's budget we are in danger of increasing our Armed Forces to the unacceptable level of 40 percent more than what we are authorized for. At the same time, the cuts to support those additional 25,000 troops and 18,000 men and women in the Reserves and National Guard that the Pentagon has proposed to this Congress are outrageous.  This bill takes a step back and steps backward on national defense. This legislation would cut defense spending by 23 percent and eliminate a whole host of programs that support our troops.
