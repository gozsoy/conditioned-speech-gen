Mr. Chairman, the amendment that I have offered is not to make in any way the policy of our House of Representatives. It is simply to make it clear that the function that the bill takes over from the Committee on Rules and the Committee on the Budget is not to set elements of our policy, it is to apply what we are sending the Department of Defense to do; and the next thing they do is spend an enormous amount of money, and the very same thing that our budget and our committees and our leadership has told them to do is to do the exact opposite.  We have a budget that we're working on. We have a committee that

The economists who are advising on the policies of the Federal Reserve said last week that this rate was too low. I think, Mr. President, the analysts who have been writing the policy on the Federal Reserve President, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve,

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Last Friday the House passed a rule for consideration of the fiscal year 1997 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. The rule states that the rule provides for the consideration of the bill without a commitment that a point of order would be raised against it or that it would be considered under other provisions of law that would prohibit legislative action or the consideration of legislation or bills not otherwise provided for insurance provisions. The rule then provides for consideration of the bill on Monday of this week.  Madam Speaker, if the bill has not yet been laid before the House, I hope that both sides

Mr. Chairman, my colleague from Illinois is correct in saying that this is not going to solve the health care problem we have now, but it will give us the basis for future reform proposals because it is one approach to what we need to do to understand that we do need to think about this issue not only what we regard as the solvency of the system but also the nature of that solvency itself and whether or not that is simply referable to the position of the individual in his or her own State and in terms of private insurance company reimbursements.  This is not what I would think we want to be doing here, so I

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment I have just filed to the Dole amendment to the military construction appropriations bill for fiscal year 1995 and to the Department of the Army appropriations bill for fiscal year 1995. I would like to issue the following statement in response to the remarks of the Republican leader and to the Republican majority in the Senate today about this bipartisan agreement on this floor to include a defense budget agreement which will end some of the Bush era tax cuts and raise the personal income tax rates. The Bush budget represents something of an economic red herring that will cost the American taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars in higher interest and higher deficits.

Today I rise to express my strong support for the budget resolution being reported by the House of Representatives as provided for in the conference report and urge the adoption of the conference report by the Senate. This amendment is supported by both sides of the aisle, including the distinguished Republican leaders

The regime of President Vladimir Putin today has taken the unprecedented step of announcing a new one-week time during which no new new arms sales will be allowed reunion to Russia. While I support new measures as we transition from the cold war to an alliance that is focused on defending our interests overseas, I believe that it is also important that we

Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada came to the floor in defense of Medicare for seniors, but he wasn't willing to recognize Medicaid waiver programs, one of the provisions in his budget that cuts NIH funding for the very programs that do protect our seniors. So what we have in this amendment is a provision that cuts $44 billion from NIH and waive some budget authority on that of Medicaid.  Why would we want to eliminate these programs in the Senator's budget? One of the reasons would be that in Medicare, we have a system where we take care of both the physician and the patient. You have to participate in the program as a physician and then

Madam Chairwoman, the American people expect us to work together on matters of critical importance to the American people. And the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee has met twice over the past week to provide an oversight panel with oversight responsibility over issues of national security and homeland security. Chairman Chairman Chairman Chairman chairwoman Lee just articulated why this is important. I would add that we have members from virtually every intelligence and law enforcement sector in this country that have strong concerns about our committee work. And this oversight responsibility is critically important to these agencies. Madame Chairwoman, if we take away our oversight and leadership from the committees, what do the rest of the agencies

Every day, more than 25 million families fail to pay the full amount of Social Security and other benefits on time or are over the program's limit. That's a national problem. Every state and every district has one too many. We need to change that.  However, I also believe we must start by reauthorizing the earned income tax credit, which today is only $1.10. The workers and families of America deserve a tax cut.

Madam President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for those very important words, and I also thank him for his work on this legislation that will make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans every day in the State of Wyoming.  I think that most Americans are aware of the serious economic impact that lithium mine closures have had in Wyoming in the last couple of years. This is a bill that, if adopted by Congress, would help us ensure that Wyoming remains a nuclear family friendly state. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his leadership and the members of the Senate Commerce Committee who worked so hard to make this bill work.  I yield back

These companies are facing tremendous economic downturns due to economy in their home market and growing concerns over the safety of the U.S. global missile defense system.  Last year, Lockheed Martin was ranked as the No. 1 United States contractor by the International Union of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, a membership that has opposed the new weapons system. Their CEO, Bob McNerney, earned approximately $8 million last year and works on a deal to sell 5,000 of its 150-plus planes to China.

That legislation was a $500 million bill that was written with big tax breaks and there was a list of bill sponsors and it did not do what Morris had promised to do. He promised to work on this problem but, unfortunately, the real problem in the health care system is that we did not have a public option that

These figures come from the latest survey from the Council of Economic Advisers to make the case for health care reform that will help to reduce rising costs for us all. The survey did not take into account percent of each industry's purchases of health care for their employees and even the costs of corporate health plans might affect the impending changes.  This is simply a joke, not a serious attempt to reform the Nation's health care system. Just last month the administration issued a briefing report on the Federal approach to a broken health care

Mr. Speaker, this special order tonight is about a resolution that was offered this afternoon that I support by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Edwards). It is called the Government of the People by the People for the People Act. This is the first budget deficit in history that I believe the first generation of Americans from farm families have seen. It is true that we may have increased debt yielding, it may have decreased the economic freedom of people, but I think this the year that the American people are going to finally be beginning to get a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, for real.  We are listening to Republicans

Most Americans are aware that we are struggling right

Mr. President, last week President Clinton announced a $2 billion deal with Indian tribes in a deal that is worthy of President Clinton. I have said from the very beginning that we are going to be going to executive session and pass that as well. But I do not believe that Congress and the executive branch have the means to get the record straight about that agreement. In Chambers they have voted ``no'' on it, and the President has approved it. So what we are getting to is that the 2\1/2\ billion in Indian tribes agreement really is earmarked for specific programs. Let us go through the program.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

And under the President's moratorium legislation, the moratorium will apply for 6 years, as indicated on page H.R. 3075. And it is the President's intention that that moratorium will last indefinitely, because, as my colleague from Utah said, that is his intent. It is a very serious matter and the President has indicated his intention to carry out his moratorium. So the gentleman from Massachusetts would be prohibited by section 6103 of the act to use the moratorium as the justification for using funds in

And yet, yesterday on the House floor we passed a resolution that we issued to express our opposition to this administration's plan to bring weapons of mass destruction to Iraq. So it is time to give that deadline a lot more latitude to be accurate.  I would have preferred that we would have gotten more accurate yesterday. Today we will get closer to being accurate than we did in 2003, but the fact remains that Americans
