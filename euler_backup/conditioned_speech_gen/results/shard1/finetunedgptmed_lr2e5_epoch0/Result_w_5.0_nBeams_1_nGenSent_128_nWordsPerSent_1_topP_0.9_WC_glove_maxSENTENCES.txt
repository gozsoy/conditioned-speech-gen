Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to be clear here on this amendment that I do not want to put an end to any other kind of religious law that is going to be involved in this debate at all. In fact, I think that we ought to make some attempt to be at least some kind of a companion to the House bill that we have before us this evening, but we want to make sure that we do not go in the direction of people who want to go out and defy the laws of our Nation and interfere with people of other faiths by writing law that does not really have religious elements.

Hunter served the State of Tennessee for 46 years and was the third Governor of the State. He was also the owner of the top firm of tax lawyers in the country. He is best known as the chairman of the Council of Tax Commissioners which was created by the Act of March 16, 1965. Since that day, the Council has advised the members of the Tennessee Legislature and members of the Federal Government on corporate tax matters. Robert and I were honored to know him for more than

Mr. Speaker, if we look at the precedent that we have in our country before this administration, the Congress did a bipartisan process in 1974. It passed a constitutional amendment to abolish the Congress and it passed a constitutional amendment that left our States and our local governments and our local governments to make their own decisions on the enforcement of the state and local Government laws. And what that meant is that when the Federal Government tries to come in and violate the constitutional rights of the States and local governments, it is in the name of local control. It is not in the name of Federal Government control.  And now as the precedent is before us today, the Senator

But the way we are doing this is that in the House we passed a bill that in its current form would have sent hundreds of millions of dollars to the biggest corporations in the country and did not stop the current high level of tax cuts for the top 1 percent of the people in America and the middle class

Mr. President, I will now take the opportunity to raise with the Senate and the President a proposal I have seen in the American people--10 percent of the excise tax levied on gasoline will go to pay for transportation projects at a time when the Federal Government is already out of money--10 percent of the gas tax will be used to pay for roads, highways and bridges. That means that the people who work in the transportation industry in my State of Maine will not be paying taxes but will instead be helping to support roads, highways and bridges. So I am very hopeful that people will vote in this past election for the next President of the United States because

But the Republicans fail to recognize that if their tax cut goes through the Senate they will just leave the families without health insurance and tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations will go back into a trust fund to be used for lavish political purposes.

<|endoftext|>Welfare for the well off comes from government spending and requires Federal subsidies as well as government benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid.  When you reduce spending and increase benefits on working people, more tax money goes to the taxpayers instead of the employers. That is the simple truth of the matter.  That is also the common cause for both parties with the President having a great deal of legislation before Congress that will reduce spending and increase benefits. When those are free from the budgetary straitjacket of budget caps or other mandates that work well for some people but not for the poor and working people and that provide no guarantee of future benefits and

He has talked about plans for that replacement and its revenue stream and the revenue stream of the existing fleet, and now, given this budget cut by the previous administration, it seems like this is another new replacement and that this budget cut will be needed in order to pay for it. This is the way to pay for it. It is bad policy.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the lives lost in a deadly motorcycle accident on Route 5 near Roswell this past weekend. The crash was reported as being in a traffic accident on the road in his area and there were no injuries to the public as a result of the accident. The incident took place around 10 a.m. on Saturday as the driver of a Nissan Sentra was attempting to exit the Route 5 main road at the southern end of the Rio Grande River in the town of Sand Creek, Texas, when the seatbelt on his vehicle failed to secure his seat and he lost control and crashed into the upper level

He said, ``It is now clear that the current Iraqi situation is a much greater security concern than the situation in Iraq at the present time because the absence of troops at home is a much greater security concern.''

The point that I want to make is that we must bring our economy up to date, our economy creates jobs, provides benefits to the middle class, and benefits to all Americans, but it also will add to our debt and a burden for the American people.

It really addresses an issue that is very important. It will create good-paying jobs. The timing of the bill is very good. It needs to be passed because we need to ensure the United States remains a leader in developing nations.  As it stands now, we are importing the highest manufacturing in the world.

I have had the opportunity to know many women in my office who have done the hard work of raising their families and fulfilling their responsibilities to their families and communities.
