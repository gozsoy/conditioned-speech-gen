Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. House Joint Resolution 4 is the only way to bring the people back to their own communities to focus on the elements that make this country great.  Mr. Chairman, I have a list here of 14 questions I would like to ask of the administration on this bill.  First, why did the administration not release the 9/11 Commission report before they brought it to the floor?  Second, why did the administration continue to argue against reform of the entitlement system in the past?  Third, why did the administration continue to fight for more Washington control of the health care system?

Mr. President, President Clinton is no doubt aware that the amendment that I am offering today is a response to the proposed system of voluntary stem cell research which is being discussed in Congress and which has received overwhelming support in the last Congress. I have no intention of diverting attention from that issue by the filing of this amendment.  The President's own Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tommy Thompson, has stated that: The President is correct. This amendment is not a plan to end stem cell research. Rather, it would allow the research to continue on embryonic stem cells, and this research could be done under ethical guidelines.  However, there is

schools increased star 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, this week we mark the 50th year of the star wars program and it is due to increase our funding by more than 20 percent to $4 billion for this year and to more than $8 billion in fiscal year 1998 and schools across America are going to learn more about the benefits of star wars than ever before.  This program has been an incredible success and has helped transform our Nation from a world dominated by foreign countries into a world in which we can truly be proud of our own national character. It has not only helped to develop the talents of thousands of young Americans, but has also become a model for other nations to emulate.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor today in a very unusual way to talk about the recently passed health care bill before the Senate and in particular about the retirement of the two of my two years of service in the Senate.  I came to the floor today to talk about two issues. First, we have a very important bill that is going to be before us, and it is a very important bill that is going to be before us next week.  We are going to be talking about it this week. We are going to be talking about it in a very unique way. We are going to be talking about the health care reform bill

Mr. Speaker, this bill would increase special education funding by $14 million over last year's level for Texas public schools. This is a fair compromise that reflects the objection of a great number of parents, teachers, and others to the amount of money being spent on special education in this bill.  The formula used to determine the amount of funding for special education in this bill is based on the State population, the number of students in the State, the need of special education services for students with disabilities, and the number of children in the State who are disabled. This formula reflects the changing needs of the country and of our own States.  Unfortunately,

Mr. President, President Bush will be speaking tomorrow on the subject of energy policy. It is an area in which I believe we have to continue to focus on our Nation's Midwest and our great State of Illinois, where we have some of the Nation's best coal reserves, as well as some of the Nation's best natural gas reserves.  The President will be speaking about how we are going to do what we can to promote energy independence in the United States of America, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to create jobs in the United States of America, and to make sure that we have a strong, clean, safe, affordable energy future for

This is a Republican bill. This is a bill that has over $100 billion in it for new nuclear powerplants, and $1.5 billion for a new nuclear reactor at Yucca Mountain. That is what the war on coal is all about.  I have been listening to this debate, and I am just struck by the

american care cost

Madam President, I will be very brief because I think it is important to say this about what the health care bill does for American workers and the cost of health care in this country.  We have heard from our Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle the number of uninsured Americans. In fact, we have heard from the Republican side of the aisle that it is now 5 million, 6 million. That is not a significant number. But the number of uninsured Americans is the number of Americans who do not have access to health care, who are being denied access to health care. That is the number of uninsured Americans.  If we want to

The reason I am disappointed is that it does not include a number of very important reforms that I think are essential for us to have a better future for our children and grandchildren.  It is one thing to put in a $20 billion tax cut for people who are already doing very well. But that money could not be used for deficit reduction.  We could not spend $10 billion of that

Mr. Speaker, as we consider the Coast Guard bill legislation that we are considering today I would like to focus on the important provisions of the bill that would ensure the Coast Guard has the tools and the training it needs to effectively and efficiently carry out its vital mission.  For the past 3 years, the Coast Guard has been forced to rely on short-term temporary training contracts to conduct a large number of training exercises. These short-term contracts are badly needed and we need to replace them.  In the past, we have been unable to provide adequate funding to support the training needs of the Coast Guard.  For example, the Coast Guard's response

Mr. Speaker, providing Medicare catastrophic health care for seniors is a priority. We must make sure that our seniors have access to quality, affordable health care, and we must help them to plan for their future.  This budget provides $108 billion in spending cuts to Medicare, which would be devastating to the Medicare program and to seniors.  The Republican budget is about doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. It is a program that provides coverage for seniors who cannot afford health care, and it is a program that is being used as a piggy bank to help fund tax cuts for the wealthy.  The Medicare Program is going broke. We need to

Mr. Speaker, I would just say to the previous speaker that he is exactly right on that one point when he says that the troops are in the field when they have soldiers in the Army and in the Air Force and in the Marine Corps that they have to be in the same year that they are in the field.  The gentleman is absolutely correct. And we have heard over and over again that this money is not for our troops, but it is for the folks at home. It is for our soldiers, for our soldiers' families, for the military that we have in the field. It is for those who are not deployed, those who are

Mr. President, as we move to the ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore of the Senate this morning to speak on the process of judiciary nominations, I would like to make a couple of observations.  I want to start by saying that I believe the President's handling of judicial nominations has been fair and balanced. It has been an open process. There has been plenty of time for Senators to offer their amendments. The majority leader and I both know we have worked very hard to produce a bill that reflects the interests of the Senate.  I also want to make a couple of observations on the nomination of Judge Barrett. Judge Barrett is a person who has been

The project is not on schedule. The funding is not there. And the price tag is $1.5 billion

If the House passes a CR, it will expire on September 30, and that is why I am asking my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit.
