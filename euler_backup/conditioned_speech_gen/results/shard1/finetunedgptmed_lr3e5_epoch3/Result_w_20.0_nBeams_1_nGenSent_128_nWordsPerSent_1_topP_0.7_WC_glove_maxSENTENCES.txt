Mr. President President State juvenile crime is the No. 1 crime problem in the United States. Unfortunately, it is one of the most neglected, in large part because of the failed response of Federal and State officials to the problem.  It is estimated that there are roughly 13 million youth aged 12 to 17 in the United States, with approximately 3 million of these aged 12 to 17. In my home State of Washington, youth aged 12 to 17 comprise about one-third of the juvenile population. Juveniles commit a disproportionate number of juvenile crime, and the effects of their crimes on the lives of their peers are profound.  In Washington State, youth aged

Mr. President President Republicans hour here this afternoon is really about the biggest, most important issues facing the American people today. And the most important issue that faces the American people today is that we have got to deal with the fact that the Federal Government is running a deficit, that we have got to put our fiscal house in order, and that we have got to start cutting spending, and we have got to do it now.  So what we are here for this hour this afternoon is to talk about what the Republican plan is to do to balance the budget in 7 years, what the Republican plan is to do to reduce the deficit in 7 years, what

Madam Speaker Members of the people hearing us, they're going to wonder what we're doing. We're doing the exact same thing we did last year.  We're passing a bill that is loaded with fraud, incompetence, and abuse. The American people don't want us to do this. We don't want to go through this again.  We've had a lot of questions raised about this bill. The folks at home are concerned about the Medicare cuts. But this bill has been loaded with fraud, incompetence, and abuse. It's an unfair bill, it's a bill that will hurt seniors and children, and it's a bill that

In response to concerns that my amendment would raise the eligibility age to 67, the amendment was dropped from the report, and a substitute amendment was introduced by Senator Daschle. I support that substitute amendment.  The substitute amendment I introduced provides an acceptable solution to the Medicare eligibility problem.

We must do better, and we must act quickly. The administration's failure to secure our border is a serious problem, and it is a challenge that is going to require long-term solutions.  Congress must act quickly to address the growing crisis at the border, but it must also take swift action to address the real root of the problem.  The President must continue to enforce the law, and Congress must continue to pass comprehensive immigration reform.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker people business American people and, indeed, the American public, deserve a strong and effective immigration system. The truth is that the President's failed immigration policy has driven up the cost of the American people's housing and education. We have seen it in the skyrocketing costs of college education, student loans, home mortgages, auto loans, and, of course, on the rental side.  I think the people in this country understand that the President's policy is a failure. He has failed to secure our borders, he has failed to enforce our immigration laws, and he has failed to secure our homeland. The President's policies are the reason

David Satcher has an extraordinary background and has brought an extraordinary background to this important position.
