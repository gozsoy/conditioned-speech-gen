It is important that we stop this all-out attack on Federal child nutrition programs and the need for change as a result of the recent terrorist attacks on the Nation's capital and other major attacks on our Nation's soil. These attacks have turned the attention of our Nation's many to hunger and the fact that children are among our most vulnerable and do not belong on the school breakfast and lunch program.

It simply says that the authority provided in this act is not in fact an unfunded mandate, as some have argued. I think that is a very clear distinction. We should not be imposing mandates on States and local governments under this act.  Under the bill as it is currently written, there are a number of very important activities that are already being undertaken by the Federal Government under this act, and those activities are already being carried out by local governments and State governments and local governments and school districts
