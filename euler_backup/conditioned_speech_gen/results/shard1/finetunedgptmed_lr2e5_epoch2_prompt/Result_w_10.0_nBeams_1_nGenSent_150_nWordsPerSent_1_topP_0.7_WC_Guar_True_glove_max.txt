criteria make elements 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states that no more than 20 percent of the funds made available to any one Federal agency can be made available to make any element of the criteria set forth in the act.  The National Academy of Sciences, a nonpartisan body of scientists who studies the environmental impacts of our Nation's activities, finds that it is very difficult to determine what environmental technology is currently available to any one Federal agency, as this act does not make it possible to do so. The bill does not include a definition of the environmental technology program. This bill is a clarifying amendment to ensure that the Federal Government is not discriminating against environmental technologies in awarding grants.  There is considerable controversy in this Congress about whether the Department of Energy has adequately selected the best environmental technologies for Federal funding. The

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I think is one of the real concerns that Senator Kyl and I have regarding this amendment and other abuse of the reconciliation process that we have heard about in the last few days. We have heard that we are talking about 10 times as much money going into the Medicare Program as we are taking out. That is simply not true.  If we do not address the abuse of the reconciliation process in the coming year, we will be forced to look at the Medicare Program, and we will be forced to go back to the point that we were in last year when we were on a path to increase Medicare spending by $600 billion.  There are a lot of different things that are going on in this debate. We have heard that Senator Dole is willing to

generations osteoporosis owe 

Final sequence: 

I agree that osteoporosis should be the focus of aggressive detection, prevention and treatment activities. However, we do not believe that prevention alone will result in long term bone mineral osteoporosis control. The focus of these programs must be on long term generations of children who owe their healthy bones to their parents' efforts.  I believe the savings from the program are in the prevention of osteoporosis. The ability to encourage a healthy lifestyle for children through regular physical activity is one of the most important aspects of prevention. As a member of the Health Subcommittee, I have worked with our State's health departments to address the need for physical activity in the State's public schools. We need to make sure that all children have a physical activity and that physical activity is included in our educational curriculum.  I would like to make a few comments on the measure

This is not a complicated amendment. It is not a technical amendment. It is not something that is going to cost a lot of money. It is not something that will require a lot of additional study.  It simply provides that this Congress would not waive the Federal air pollution standards for the manufacture of hazardous waste incinerators, or any other fuel-burning device, unless there was a substantial and compelling public health and safety concern.

Since CAPA began operations in 1986, CAPA has been an essential resource for Congress, the administration, and the intelligence community to monitor, track, and counter a wide range of critical national security issues. CAPA is essential to protecting our Nation's national security.  CAPA's employees have served our Nation in every conflict since World War II, and it is fitting that CAPA's doors are closing.

america economic budgets 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is necessary to limit the Federal Government's power to spend more than it takes in and to control economic growth and the budget deficit as well as America's economic future.  The Balanced Budget Amendment is a straightforward and simple proposition. The Congress must adopt a constitutional amendment that balances the budget. A balanced budget amendment provides the framework to govern the Federal Government's future. It is a contract with the American people that we will balance the budget in 7 years, by controlling Federal spending, by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.  I believe that we have come to the point where we have made progress in this area. I would like to speak a little bit about the importance of this issue and its significance to our country and to the future of this country.  Mr. President, I think we all

The only point that I would make in that is that in the last few years, we've seen some good news in the San Diego area, particularly from some of the areas of the U.S. Forest Service.

There are more than three abortions performed every minute. And in my own State of New York, there are more than 100,000 abortions per year.  We should not be shocked that our Nation is once again in a situation where we have to be debating this issue. It is not that abortion is not necessary for a woman's health or for her family's health. It is that there are other methods of family planning available to women.

The people of the Ottoman Empire, in an effort to maintain control of their Turkish homeland, executed a number of prominent political, intellectual, and religious figures in an effort to eliminate the Armenian population.  During the period of the 1920s, the Ottoman Empire imposed restrictions on the religious and cultural practices of the Armenian people. Some of the most notable cases of forced conversions included the release of 200 Armenian prisoners of war from the Ottomans' Turkish prison. The men were later executed and their families deported to Siberia where they

Mr. Chairman, it seems to me, since we agree, that the problem is that the problem is that we do not care enough about seniors and the waivers are given to people who are just not going to take care of their seniors, not a very good way to treat people who are really not a burden on the system.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Card program.  This program was created by Congress in 2004 to provide for the direct access of veterans to VA health care by ensuring that they can obtain their benefits through the electronic transfer of their I.D. card. The bill we are considering today will provide immediate benefits to over 3.7 million veterans nationwide.  Currently, veterans who have a disability, illness, or injury that requires immediate care must travel long distances to get their care. This can be especially difficult for veterans who have limited mobility and limited means.  The bill will make it easier for veterans to access care by requiring that the card be

I am very pleased to be able to join my good friend and colleague from North Carolina in this effort and will make this effort the Snowe-Johnston amendment No. 3321.  The amendment makes the following changes: First, it makes clear that the minority can file cloture motions at any time. It does not change the time limits on cloture motions. It allows the minority to file cloture motions as soon as the Senate considers the nomination. It is very important that Members understand that if a cloture motion is filed, the minority will have 60 days in which to file their second-degree amendments.  It is important that Members understand

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon]. Federal regulations and agency policies which prohibit certain forms of public participation in the evaluation and approval of public projects are clearly at odds with the spirit of this Nation.  The Committee on Public Works and Transportation was founded to ensure that public funds are used for the development of projects which are safe, efficient, and affordable. It is the Committee's responsibility to ensure that the public is fully informed of the financial and economic benefits of the projects which are under consideration. As a result, the committee has included provisions in the law prohibiting the use of funds to fund any project that prohibits or restricts participation by the general public in the selection, funding, or review of such project.

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, that is not what the Constitution says.

I think it is fair to say that there is a strong likelihood that the budget would be balanced, but the fact is that we have not balanced the budget since 1969.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, it is surely a shame that it is necessary in the year 2019 for Speaker Pelosi to say that the White House is simply out of control and that the consequences of the policies of the Trump administration are on the rise.  The President's actions have led to the worst economic conditions in decades, an unprecedented decline in jobs, and the biggest tax increase in American history.  We cannot go on as we have for the past 10 years. It is time to wake up.  The President has failed the American people, and he has failed the American Congress.  Now, Madam Speaker, we are not debating this bill today because it is important to prevent another fiscal crisis, but because the American people deserve to know what their leaders are doing in the White House.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Since then, Republicans have shown that they are willing to pay for tax cuts for wealthy Americans--just not by cutting Medicare. So we have the latest edition of the so-called ``Budget Enforcement Act,'' which is designed to force a cut in Medicare.  Now, Medicare does not pay for itself. It pays for its part B premium, but the program doesn't pay for itself. It pays for the services it provides to seniors. So we have to raise taxes on Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the rich.

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, for the first time since 1974, the House has failed to pass a budget for the first time in its history that failed to reduce the deficit by one- tough votes or ask Congress to ignore the numbers that clearly tell us that it is the right thing to do.  The budget resolution before us is the only thing that will cut the deficit. The budget is a better bill than the failed budget that was voted on last night. It includes cuts in spending that have to be made to pay for the tax cuts that the wealthiest Americans have received in the last few years.  I voted for the President's budget last night because it includes $1.4 trillion in spending cuts over the next 7 years. And, like the President, I want the cuts to come from the people who pay the taxes.  It also

This is the same farm policy that we were promised by the administration in 1994 and that we were promised would help farmers and ranchers in my district, in the Appalachian region, and in other rural areas. This is the same farm policy that is on the verge of costing taxpayers $10 billion in compliance costs.

The administration has sent the United States troops into Lebanon. Israel is suffering from a terrible epidemic. Israel is very much in the news because of the massacres and the killings of Palestinians.  The administration should have dropped the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks because they were in dire straits. They were about to be finished when the terrorist organization Hamas launched an attack on the Israeli military base in Gaza.

spend congress president 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, let us say it again: Anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. Constitution knows that no President can spend a dime of Federal tax money that has not first been authorized and appropriated by Congress--both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.  So when you hear a politician or an editor or a commentator declare that ``Reagan ran up the Federal debt'' or that ``Bush ran it up,'' bear in mind that it was, and is, the constitutional duty of Congress to control Federal spending. Congress has failed miserably in that task for more than 50 years.  The fiscal irresponsibility of Congress has created a Federal debt which stood at $4,985,670,138,675.47 as of the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, February 10. Averaged out, every man

Madam President, over this past week I had the opportunity to visit with many students, teachers and parents in New Jersey about education reform legislation that is on the Federal level and the State level and in the other 30 percent of States. This legislation is critical to the well-being of all of our students. I can assure my colleagues that this legislation is a step in the right direction.  I will not go into the details of the legislation. But I can say that I think it is a good piece of legislation. It will give the States the opportunity to do the things that are necessary for them to meet the needs of their students.  Let me give a few examples of the things that I think this legislation will do for our students.  First of all, this legislation will provide States with the ability to provide education assistance for

Let us talk about the Constitution. We are not talking about empowering the States to set the curriculum in our schools. The Constitution says that. The States have that power.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the motion to instruct conferees to resist inclusion of provisions that would allow the administration to consider the sale of the entire Project Bioshield program at the committee level.  The administration has used this program to develop and test highly effective new weapons against bioterrorists. In this time of fear and uncertainty, it is critical that Congress stand up to the administration and to ensure that this program remains on the chopping block.  The bill before us, the Omnibus appropriations bill, does just that.

It is already happening, and it is going to continue to change.  We need to do something about it. I have a bill that has been working on in my subcommittee for the last 3 years, and I think it is the right thing to do. It is about protecting our oceans and our coastal communities.

illegal watched actions

Mr. Speaker, as I watched yesterday's Senate investigations subcommittee hearing, I was disappointed to discover that the actions taken by the Federal Government to prevent illegal aliens from entering the United States in the first place were watched by the U.S. Congress, which in turn has ignored and delayed the implementation of this unconstitutional program for years.  The Senate hearings uncovered serious mismanagement of the visa lottery program, a problem that Congress should have addressed years ago.  The visa lottery is the only Government program that is operated solely by aliens and not by the United States.  It is unconstitutional and it should be stopped.

Mr. President, I want commend the distinguished Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] for bringing this budget to the Senate committee with the amendment he proposed earlier this year on tax relief for working families and for the next year and for the conference committee's action in passing the bill.  We all agree that there is a problem in this country, and it is not a family tax issue. It is not a personal tax issue. It is a corporate tax issue. There are a lot of good reasons to be against this tax cut.  The bill before us, as it is before the Senate, cuts taxes on all income groups, middle-class, upper-income, and the poor. The bottom line is that there are people who will pay more taxes in the next year and a half than they are paying today in the bill.

wto decide clinton 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the World Trade Organization has just issued its first decision in a trade dispute involving the United States of America to determine whether WTO members should allow foreign governments to decide whether they can limit the benefits of trade to the United States or to any other nation that has agreed to do so as well as to any Clinton administration executive order or White House policy.  The ruling will impose enormous economic harm on the American economy. That is why I am glad the White House is doing what it can to prevent this decision from taking place. I am hopeful that if the decision is not overturned, the administration will at least attempt to find a way to modify or undo the measure, and perhaps even withdraw it from the WTO.  In the meantime, I will continue to push for a debate in the Senate on the need for Congress to impose

We must also put a stop to the misguided and counterproductive approach of the administration to provide financial assistance to those nations that are willing to use their own citizens as human shields against a ballistic missile attack. This provision allows for the application of sanctions to any nation that provides assistance to Iran in response to a threat of attack.  The $5 million in this bill will be used to fund training programs for the International Atomic Energy Agency to assist those nations that want to implement their own safeguards.

This bill would require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to develop strong policies to prevent the marketing of spoofed products and products that generate energy by using different marketing technologies. Proponents of this bill have characterized spoofing as a legitimate marketing technique. Proponents of this bill argue that the Burgess-Watt bill provides Congress with the tools necessary to regulate this form of marketing. I agree that this legislation does need some additional regulatory authority. However, it is also important to note that H.R. 2669 does not create any new Federal or State regulation. This bill simply requires the CPSC to issue a rule that identifies, identifies and prohibits deceptive practices that result in a loss of life or property.  Proponents of this bill claim that by

For example, the lower tax rate on dividends and capital gains, which is now 31 percent, is going to increase to 45 percent, a 60-percent increase over the year. This tax break will give Americans a $500 per child tax credit.  In addition, this change in the income tax rate will affect the tax liability of low-income Americans. The tax credit will increase from 15 to 20 percent. I am

Mr. President, agencies issue probably thousands of rules each year that pertain only to one aspect of a legislative or executive activity. These routine rules are meant to make our government work better and to provide more predictable and consistent government services to the American people and to our basis of international trade.  For example, regulations that require the Department of Commerce to provide real-time guidance to the Federal Trade Commission, to provide and maintain a detailed record of how it uses its grant authority, and to use its professional staff to protect consumers against deceptive practices--all are rules that are intended to give the FTC more power to do its job.  However, in an effort to gain more control over the Federal agencies, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has recently proposed a rule that would effectively undermine the Federal Government's role in enforcing these rules.

Mr. Speaker, I have no other additional speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time so that we can move back to the House Republican budget resolution that we voted on earlier today on a bipartisan vote of 410 to 12. Republicans voted to pass Senate Joint Resolution 67, the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997, which passed the House by a vote of 392 to 8 on September 14, 1996. The Senate, however, was unable to take up that measure.  I would urge my colleagues to support the House Republican budget resolution, which was adopted by the House of Representatives today on a vote of 410 to 12.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I would point out, as I have said, that we have not taken the $85 billion out of other programs in order to meet this shortfall. We have not increased taxes. We have not increased interest rates. We have not increased defense spending.  So I think it is wrong to use a majority of the spending in this bill, because the vast majority of it is already funded, and we have done that in this bill. I think we ought to be thoughtful about it, and I think it is time to get a handle on this.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I had not planned to make a floor speech right now, but I want to make a few remarks as we debate the floor amendment to the Dole amendment which would require that we be responsible for the important environmental impact of our operations in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  My comments are based on what I have learned over the last several weeks. I learned that the U.S. is not in a position to be responsible for the environmental problems of our Nation's waters. I learned that our current policies and current administration do not allow us to be in a position to be responsible for the environmental problems of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  When I heard the administration's explanation of its intentions with regard to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, I was not surprised. I had known

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, at the end of May, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a consortium of American employers will begin the hiring process for employment in my State of Maine. This is a very exciting time for me.  Maine's unemployment rate has been stuck at 8.5 percent for the last 4 years, and it is only expected to rise further. To combat this, the U.S. Senate, by unanimous consent, authorized the INS to apply for permanent legal status for permanent workers. This proposal was endorsed by the Maine Chamber of Commerce, the American Council for the International Trade, the Maine Labor Council, the Maine Department of Human Resources, the Maine National Guard, and the Maine Port Administration.  Mr. President, Maine's contribution to the Nation's economy is significant. It is one of the fastest growing States in the Nation

Access to affordable health care is one of the pressing needs of this country and the next generation of Americans in need of access to the same kind of health care that we all take for granted today in this country that we take for granted today for so many others here in this country today that week.  It is a simple fact: access to affordable health care is one of the most fundamental needs of this country. It is the essential condition of a healthy future.  Today we are at a critical juncture. The number of uninsured Americans is rising, and the number of uninsured children is increasing.  It is essential that we continue to focus on improving the quality of health care for all Americans.

Medicare part D. Now, with great fanfare in the dark of the night, this Congress approved a number of prescription drug pharmaceutical plans. The promise was to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to lower the cost of medical care for seniors. We're all for that, but the plan that was passed did not contain all of the provisions promised. It is estimated that it would increase the cost of prescription drugs by $20 billion a year and the cost of medical care by $23 billion. And the seniors who had to pay the cost of those increased prices because of this failed plan, who were never promised the full benefit of prescription drugs, are not going to get the full benefit of prescription drugs or medical care.

Mr. Chairman, the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley] again referred to the 5-year plan.

We have a bill that provides for a 5-year plan. I think we ought to keep it up. I think the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley] is correct, the 5-year plan provides for a more realistic and more equitable distribution of spending.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, stopping the tax hike is not just about taxes; it's about jobs. Small businesses pay taxes to the government. When the President signs a bill, he signs a tax increase. When the President sends the bill to the Senate, he sends a tax increase.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend Mr. Arcuri, Mr. Engel, Mr. Hoekstra, Mr. Heck, Mr. Hyde, Mr. LoBiondo, Mr. Madame de Staub, and Mr. Kildee for their hard work on this legislation.  As a former mayor of a small city in my district, I have seen firsthand how a tax hike on a small business that's producing goods for our country will hurt our economy. This is not a partisan issue. I'm happy to have the support of

There is no information that suggests that any other agency in the Government is collecting the bulk telephone metadata in this way. This is not an issue of just the FISA Court approving the use of this technology. We have a big issue here. It is something that needs to be addressed by the Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community.

Mr. President, back in 1985, I was a second-term Member of the House of Representatives and Senator from the State of Washington and member of the Budget Committee. I was one of the first Members of Congress to introduce legislation to establish a health care plan for all Americans.  I believe that it is the duty of the Congress to give Americans a plan of their own choice, a health care plan that will help them achieve the American dream of health care security. I believe that it is the duty of the Congress to give Americans the choice of a plan that they can afford, a plan that will help them avoid the burden of a health care bill.  I believe that the Government should not interfere with the personal decisions of the American people.  In 1986, Congress adopted a national health care plan. I supported that plan. I was one

Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to talk about a topic that is forefront on everybody's mind tonight because it is something that is going to have an enormous impact on the country for the next few weeks and months to come because the Committee on Rules has announced that the rules of the House will be coming to a close tonight, that we will be going home for the Fourth of July break, and it is going to be a very short time that Members will be here because the rules that are coming back will be a complete ban on bringing amendments to the floor of the House of Representatives.  As a result of that, what we are going to have in the next few weeks and months is the most significant issue that we have been dealing with in the last 10 months, and that is the deficit. And, Mr. Speaker,

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, what troubles me is this legislation creates a Federal express line where the Federal Government claims that it has no commercial insurance, and that this legislation does not affect its commercial insurance.  There is no way this can be in the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights. There is no way this can be adopted by the Federal Government.  There is no way that this is going to help the victims of any kind. It is an exercise in chicanery.  We do not have to follow the Crapo amendment, which we all know is wrong, and I do not want to go into that here. But let us just go through the bill. It is a private insurance agency, and this is their insurance. They can go in and sign up any of the commercial insurance companies, or they can go

economy americans republicans 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, as Republicans and Democrats debate the best way to reform health care, Americans are asking themselves why Republicans have not done what Americans need to do for the economy. In a time of record deficits and $4 trillion in debt, why are Republicans proposing to tax a small number of American families, children, and retirees?  I don't think most Americans would know it, but there are some important things Republicans are proposing to do for the economy. They are proposing to tax seniors who earn over $75,000. That is the amount a senior could receive if they earned $75,000 last year. We have all heard stories about people who have worked all their lives, and yet they have $100,000 or more in their checking account, and they get to keep it. We have to balance the budget. I

For the past several years, I have been working with my friend from the other side of the aisle to increase Customs revenues by $2 billion in fiscal year 1995 to offset rising Customs and Border Protection revenues from Customs and Border Protection. I have worked hard to increase Customs revenues in a manner that would not jeopardize our Border Patrol operations or threaten the lives of Customs officers.  My amendment would not increase Customs revenues but instead would allow Customs to return to the revenue base it had at the end of fiscal year 1996, and would increase Customs fees. In addition, my amendment would not increase Customs funding above the level that Congress authorized. Customs funding is already very low in this budget, and I do not believe that additional funding is needed.  In the interest of fairness to the Customs

Mr. Speaker, as summer turns towards winter, the American people will continue to face high prices for their gasoline because of increases in demand for natural gas and oil, rising energy costs, and the failure of Congress to act. Rita, the storm that ravaged Louisiana and the Gulf Coast in August, left more than 2,000 people dead, and its devastating impact on the gulf coast and the gulf region is still fresh in people's minds.  The administration has already issued several executive orders and congressional resolutions that have allowed oil companies to refinance their debt at less than the original price. These actions by the Bush administration have created an unsustainable and unsustainable supply of oil in the United States, resulting in high gas prices.  The House must pass legislation that allows the United States to be self-sufficient in energy, energy independence, and energy independence

Lee was born in New Orleans in 1941 and grew up in New Orleans and had a lifelong dream of becoming a schoolteacher. He entered the U.S. Army in 1946, as a first lieutenant in the infantry, where he earned two Purple Hearts and two Bronze Stars. He later earned his law degree from the University of Texas School of Law and served in the United States Army for 6 years.  Lee returned to New Orleans in 1949 to attend law school and graduated from the University of Louisiana Law School. After graduating

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The gentlewoman is correct. This is an important time in our country to come together and rest and reflect on the election that took place last November. It is a historic election, and it will be a difficult one. We must make sure that we all remain united and that we focus on a clear message for the future of this country.  I think it is important to note that the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) was one of the very first to make this statement that we need to bring about some kind of comprehensive immigration reform that will strengthen our borders, that will give the ability for law enforcement officials to know who is coming into our country and who is not, that will protect our homeland security, and that will provide an opportunity for American workers to compete

This week, on Memorial Day, we remember those who have gone to school in the world's poorest countries to teach children to read and write and to defend their democracy. We remember those who have gone to school in countries like Nigeria, Haiti, and Kenya to teach them the fundamental values of democracy, freedom, and respect for human rights. We remember those who have gone to school in countries like South Sudan, China, and Cuba to teach them how to govern and develop their own nation. We remember those who have gone to

chairman audit states

It is not a novel idea. We have heard about it. It is the only proposal that has been filed on the floor today that has been supported by the American people.  I think it is time that we recognize the fact that the auditors of the executive branch are not perfect, but they are pretty darn good. The American people are watching us closely. I think it is time that we start paying them fairly.

Mr. Speaker, one year ago, our economy was on the brink of collapse; Wall Street jobs were at risk; and the Speaker of the House was facing collapse of his own.

The country has the opportunity to move forward with the vision that is within our grasp: We can and must find solutions to our challenges, not shut down the government down.  That is why I have introduced H.R. 514, the Public Contract Competition Act, which will help build a more vibrant, transparent and open economy. It will empower Americans to compete for public sector jobs by providing them with a transparent process through the Fair and Open Government Act, or the ``FOG'' as it is better known.

Mr. President, in 2015, when I heard then-candidate Donald Trump denigrate the service of my Republican Senator colleague from New Hampshire in America's political debate and campaign, I thought that McCain-Feingold would be a moment of truth. POW/MIA's and MIA's have suffered terrible consequences. They have been victimized by war, political deceit, and cruel intimidation. I remember when the Republican-led Congress passed a bill that was intended to address this long-standing injustice. I was proud to support it, and it was the first major change in American policy since the Vietnam War.  But after the bill's passage, my Republican colleagues and I had to go to work to make the changes necessary to meet the obligations of the contract. We did it by raising the minimum wage, improving access to care for the wounded, and creating

The Electronic Funds Transfer Act of 1984 was the first recipient of the Federal check-clearing system. It was a program that was initiated by Congress and was created in the context of a rush to develop a national check-clearing system. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic hurdles that would be imposed upon States and local governments in implementing this new electronic system were simply too great. A good example of this is the $1.6 billion that the Federal Government spent last year to establish the National Electronic Funds Transfer System. This new electronic system is so cumbersome that the Treasury has been forced to use some very strict budgeting standards to ensure that the Federal Government is not inadvertently shortchanging the States and localities in achieving the $1.6

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I recognize my colleague's concerns about the growth of the government in Western Europe and the rise of Chairman Henry Hyde's Federal role in defense spending. I have always believed that we should take a closer look at our foreign aid spending as we continue to confront the global challenges that we face. However, the $18.4 billion that the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] has offered is simply not sufficient to meet the most pressing national security needs of the United States.  The gentleman from New York has argued that our defense budget is at an all-time high. However, the problem is that we have not been able to get the budget in line with the needs of our domestic priorities. We do not have the kind of modernization that is needed to maintain our air power and

We must take the right steps to boost our exports and to protect American jobs. Our recent trade bill will do just that.  I am proud to support the legislation that will create a free trade agreement with the People's Republic of China. The United States-China agreement will benefit American workers and American companies, create tens of thousands of new American jobs, and, of course, reduce the costs of U.S. imports.

cigarettes billion tobacco 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment to repeal the tobacco tax increase of $4 billion that is on the tobacco cigarettes tax increase bill that was signed into law in 1993. This is a very straightforward amendment, and it is simply an effort to end the irresponsible and illegal behavior that has occurred since 1993.  I want to thank Chairman Oberstar for offering this amendment, and I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Towns and Mr. Rahall, for their support.  In 1993, Congress enacted the first Federal excise tax on cigarettes. This excise tax was placed on cigarettes because cigarette manufacturers have not been able to get a decent rate of profit for selling their products in America. The Federal Government should not have been the one who imposed the excise tax on cigarettes. This has not been an easy task.

Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the 25th anniversary of what can only be called the ``Home Home Mortgage Corporation.'' This Freddie Mac-owned and operated entity has been the largest and most successful mortgage servicer in the country for more than two decades.  Home Mortgage Corporation, commonly referred to as HUD, is a federally chartered housing finance company with an annual revenue of $100 billion.

Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this negative amendment that would eliminate funding for funding for the majority of our national parks and critical decisions regarding the Antiquities Act.

My colleagues and I have long supported the Antiquities Act and the provision it authorizes for preservation and protection of our Nation's public lands.  As chairman of the House Resources Committee, I authored the Protecting American Lands Act, which directs the administration to issue a comprehensive review of all national monuments in the United States and to make recommendations to Congress on how to enhance, expand, or preserve these monuments.  I support the National Park Service and the people who work there, and I want them to have the resources they need to protect our

H.R. 1530 is a massive giveaway to the oil and gas industry. It is the result of a rushed process. It is a deliberate attempt to undermine the economic and environmental interests of our Nation's coastal communities and to drive up the price of gas at the pump.

It is because of the fact that the public trust has been destroyed by the misuse of our public trust.  The gentleman has pointed out that in the 1970's the public trust was totally eroded.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act, which is cosponsored by Senators Eastland and Lieberman and bill sponsors Senators Pressler and Grant.  This bill would encourage the State Department to facilitate a comprehensive, multilateral, international approach to international energy supplies, which would provide greater certainty and certainty for both Israeli and American consumers. The bill would make it easier for the United States to influence the United Nations on energy issues, and would assist Israel in promoting greater international energy supplies and innovation.  I believe that our State Department is currently hampered in its efforts to influence the international community on energy issues by the fact that it is not actively involved in foreign policy issues. The only policy initiative in which the State Department has a direct interest is the oil and gas program. However, in recent years, the State Department has made

I know we are here to do our job, and we have an obligation to do our job, and we have an obligation to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.  It is going to take compromise to get the full Senate bill up for a vote.

Mr. Speaker, this is a bill which is in the public interest. The Kingston amendment would prohibit funding for the continuation of a program that has not yet been authorized and authorized in this Congress. It is not appropriate for this body to continue funding for an organization that we have not authorized.  The Congress has already appropriated $17.4 million for the program.

I am happy to be a part of the celebration as we celebrate North's humble beginnings in 1919.  North's first foray into brewing was in the small town of Kootenai, WA. It was the first brewery in Washington State to actually sell beer. The owners of North, Andrew and Gene Haakon, were both farmers. They started their own brewery in 1922, but because the wheat and barley were not producing, they decided to go back to home brewing and begin a second brewery in the town of Spokane. In 1927, the Haakon brothers opened North on the grounds of a local high

Mr. Chairman, without a doubt, this period in history will record that the United States committed the world in Iraq in a time of great need and a challenge to America's military and intelligence capabilities.  Unfortunately, the Congress has chosen to retreat from that mission and have given the President the power to wage war without congressional approval. The President has used this authority in a misguided manner, and our national security is not at risk.  We all remember what happened in the Persian Gulf. We all remember what happened in Somalia. We remember what happened in Somalia. We all remember what happened in Somalia. But we should never forget what happened in Iraq.  The Iraqis did not ask us to invade them.

This bill was first introduced by my colleague Senator Lugar and is supported by the Judiciary Committee, the Judiciary and House Judiciary Committees, the National Association of Secretaries of State, the National League of Cities, and other groups that represent the interests of Federal election officials.  This bill is not a perfect bill, and there are many, many improvements that I believe are necessary. It will not prevent future Federal election fraud, and it will not, in any way, limit the right of an individual or an organization to engage in elections fraud.

Instead, Democrats, working with President Trump, have moved forward with legislation that would take even more of our resources away from our border to make it more difficult for those who have tried to cross the border illegally.  Our Republican colleagues say that their border security bill is only a response to a series of attacks that President Trump and President Obama have made on our country. Well, it's not clear what the attacks are. And the fact that they were made against the President of the United States does not give us much hope that the President is listening.

extend deadline september

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1335 would extend for 6 months the deadline for the sale of the September 11 Memorial.  The bill has the support of the majority and minority of the Committee on Financial Services, and I urge its passage.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

million united friend 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend that in the United States of America $50 million is a very significant amount. We know that when we spend $50 million, $50 million is a lot of money. We spend $50 million in the United States of America, and that is more than we spend in Europe.  Mr. Chairman, I think that the people of the United States should be consulted on this issue. I think that the American people have a right to know the kind of defense spending that we are putting forward in this bill, and I think that the American people have a right to know that it is really not necessary to spend a million dollars in Europe for the defense of their country.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

international gentleman resolution 

Final sequence: 

I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), who has a strong interest in international security and is a gentleman who has been very active on this issue of resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I rise in strong support of this resolution.  There are certain questions that we should be asking in terms of whether we should have a negotiated settlement, and we should be asking those questions in terms of whether we should have a way to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to bring peace to the region.  And I rise today to support the motion to recommit because it's time to begin to make sure that this issue of the status of the Palestinian people is addressed in a comprehensive way. And so I urge my colleagues to support the motion to

secretary reminded state 

Final sequence: 

I am reminded of a friend of mine, when I was the Secretary of State in the State of Texas when Secretary Powell asked me to come to the State and to see how the country was going to respond to the fact that the President had reminded the country of the possibility of nuclear war. I remember a conversation with Secretary Powell and I said, Well, I would like to come and visit with you, and he said, Well, you will be disappointed, because you will have to have a lot of people to go up there. And he said, Well, there will be a number of people who will be there. And I said, Well, that is good, but there are going to be some problems.  So I went down to the State and I said, Well, we are going to have a briefing on

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to my friend from New York (Mr. Israel), the proud father of our new Congresswoman and the very important representative of New York's 2nd Congressional District.  Mr. ISRAEL. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Mr. Flake and Mr. King, for bringing this important resolution to the floor. I rise in support of H. Res. 585, which I introduced earlier today, which condemns the violence and oppression against the Rohingya people in Burma.  This body has the unique opportunity to do something that can be both important and timely, and that is to make a statement that has been, unfortunately, virtually ignored in this Congress. But I am very pleased to be joined in this effort

speaker record amendment 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I simply want to respond to one theme that we have heard here today and that is the Speaker has gone over to the Senate amendment to the record in an attempt to put a squeeze on this matter.  The fact of the matter is, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Clinger] and I had an amendment to put a date certain for the transition to a universal service program, the P.A.E.A.S. plan. That was voted out of the House. We tried to put that in the Constitution. The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Clinger] has gone over to the Senate and says, we are going to try to put a date certain for the transition to a universal service program.  The fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr

president amendment passed 

Final sequence: 

I am talking about the heart and soul of welfare policy; I am not talking about the President or the Congress passing legislation that will make that amendment permanent.  I am not talking about extending the old welfare system, which is one of the most shameful policies in the history of this country. I am not talking about the President of the United States being able to do whatever he wants with this amendment. I am not talking about a constitutional amendment that will have the effect of changing the welfare program from a benefit to a trap.  I am talking about a policy that is based on a myth. That is what this amendment is. The President says, ``I am going to eliminate this benefit.'' Well, that is the most bizarre thing I have ever heard.  What we have done is take a policy that works. What we
