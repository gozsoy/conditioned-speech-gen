Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states that if a project is not to be required to go to the full Senate and House of Representatives before the beginning of a fiscal year 1996 appropriation year because of that project, any committee or subcommittee can create that environmental technology so that the government could not get the full amount it is due before a date certain for the rest of that fiscal year. The concept of this amendment is the same as that which we passed last year with respect to the WRDA-as-we-know-it provisions. We should not change that but should make it more flexible and ensure that new uses are not subject to requirements of this legislation as to what they will involve in bringing this technology forward and still allow that technology to be developed under our criteria to be more cost effective

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I believe is the real issue before this body--our proposal on college affordability for all Americans.  How can we better encourage higher education among our young people while we continue to put such limits on affordable college loans and standards for health insurance plans in which young people can receive assistance from the Federal Government--$30,000 for a family of three and not so much for young people who are enrolled in college or who are currently in school?  We have got to think not just about the question of college education but about the question of health insurance for all. We have to think about the question of health care, especially for young people, and how they can acquire the necessary health insurance when they are in high school. For all Americans, particularly the young

Mr. President, President Theodore Roosevelt once wrote, ``Death is always and under all circumstances a great advantage to men.'' In our current time we face challenges to our health and well-being as we deal with a global pandemic that threatens to destroy our health care system, and in the process prolong the life of tens of millions of our fellow citizens. The President's statement is certainly appropriate to ensure that our actions reflect his priorities, and I think we all should read this important quote before us.  On October 9 of this year, the Secretary of the Interior announced that the Army Corps of Engineers had reached a ``consensus on the dredging of the Sierra Madre River in California.'' This decision, so closely aligned with the policy statement he issued just a month earlier, was announced as the first step toward identifying our southern California urban areas

There is one area that we have not covered quite yet which is the aging of our older folks and their impact on our society and on our way of life, and that is age discrimination in the Medicare system. I have mentioned this many times this week on our floor.  Unfortunately, there are some seniors who do not have Medicare, and they are put through tremendous struggle and humiliation by the age that they reach. We need to look at ways in which we can address that issue. We can improve the Medicare system by improving and expanding the medical savings accounts, or MSA's, for these

Unfortunately, that would have to be made by the courts, or by the Department of Homeland Security, or even by the Department of Education--because that's how the court system works. But the other idea behind the bill that the majority has come up with is that they will provide these funds so they can be used for emergency purposes so that other disasters don't come about and they would be used for those other purposes as they had no way to use those funds for anything. So these things would be paid for with nothing but emergency funding so that no disaster would ever come about, but it would be an emergency which would require a response and that response would be provided so that we don't have any future disasters come about.  The problem is that we are faced with a very significant change in the way the United States Government is doing

It will be devastating because these employees have already been given temporary retirement benefits because of an impending furlough in the Pentagon that was required to try and respond to the Desert Storm emergency.  These employees have an alternative plan in place because they have worked very hard for their paychecks. The compromise in this piece of legislation allows them to keep their salary.

I also want to note that it was a huge and forward-looking effort when Congress first decided to fund the National Park Service in 1996 and authorized the establishment of the National Park System and authorized the transfer of over 1 million acres of Federal land from private to public ownership in order to create this national memorial for the year 2000. As of 2017, the House and Senate both passed bills designating the monument to honor the service and sacrifice of Emancipation Army General Henry Lee and the new Emancipation Veterans Memorial

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Kyl and Robb, I offer an amendment which requires the administration to report to Congress on the total and total cost of the program at the end of the fiscal year. This amendment is similar to my proposal which requires the President to submit to Congress a plan for fiscal year 1995 for the program.  According to the Office of Management and Budget, this program was originally authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 as a cost-of-living increase program. The administration has since terminated this program and re-established this program in accordance with the stated intentions of Congress.  What is the fiscal impact of this program?  As Senators know, I agree with the Senate Labor Committee's recommendation for an energy efficiency spending account in the Interior Department's budget. I believe this would be a wise and constructive approach to

Throughout our history, Armenians and all peoples have endured persecution and oppression at the hands of oppressive governments, dictators, and kleptocrats. From the brutally independent state of Azerbaijan and the oppressive regime in Iraq, to the horrible case of Rwandan genocide, and now with the Armenian genocide, all people have suffered the deplorable deeds and unconscionable actions of other people.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment and in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas].  The reasons are very similar. The program that is being cut is one of the last of the Federal agency clean water programs because there are less regulations and more flexibility and less paperwork. We know from other experience, for example, of the dramatic and dramatic increases in regulation of soft drink companies that there has been a huge amount of litigation and a huge burden placed on those soft drink companies because they need to be competitive at this point in time and also because they have to comply with some very complex laws.  We have become accustomed to the idea of businesses saying, ``We will comply if you give us the flexibility to do so, and

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, that is not what the Constitution says. The Constitution says, all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; and the House may determine what constitutes a revenue. The Budget Act does not require a revenue for the Treasury to be raised in order for the Government to function. All revenue dollars are subject to the budget resolution of each House and the rules of each House relating to the pay of Members and expenses of the House in respect of the salary of its Members and expenses of its expenses of its committees and that of the President.  If you apply the words of the Constitution to a Federal Government that is required to raise the full amount of revenue as a condition for funding the Federal Government, that is an issue that is not a question of whether the majority party is in control of Congress but whether the

Madam Speaker, it is surely a shame that it is necessary in the year 2019 that the White House convened a National Prayer Breakfast not to discuss the crisis confronting our country but to bring shame to the Speaker of the House and the President.  I am certain that the Speaker and the President understand that this issue would not have been discussed had the White House not announced that they were going to be at the gathering, if for no other reason than they cannot stop their rhetoric from being too immoral and too insensitive to the catastrophe that is the epidemic that is facing our country. The Speaker and the President understand that they will not have that discussion because they will not be at this terrible gathering of shame and moral failure.

These were the following recommendations for the system that is now in its fifth year of existence in this country and that should be the way the system works if the same principles were followed in the future in our financial house.

They raised taxes to the detriment of the middle class and to children and everyone else in the country. They reduced tax deductions for working families. They increased taxes on dividends and capital gains.  In the end, when they got to the $1 million bracket, they brought the tax liability, the rate, which used to be a very reasonable deduction, to $45,000. They increased the rates that worked in the typical family's pocketbooks.

The American people believe that Federal agencies have a responsibility to keep their information out of the wrong hands and that they are required to defend the information they hold from law enforcement or unauthorised access. This amendment sends a signal to the Federal agencies that the Congress of the United States shares their concerns that the protection of private information cannot be delegated to the executive branch. Congress has a responsibility to be informed about the cost of classified information and whether there are risks to the

Mr. President, I have been briefed by the Department of Defense. The cost for the five helicopters should not exceed $929 million for fiscal year 1997. The cost for all of the additional personnel necessary to support the Army National Guard combat helicopter fleet as provided for in this amendment is $1,275 million. This means that $1 million can be borrowed from the Pentagon's general fund and used to buy up to five additional military helicopters. This can be accomplished at a cost of only $100 million, or $450 per helicopter.  The issue is about dollars and cents, and to go to arms control without putting in money for the real mission and with the administration vetoing the bill is outrageous. I urge my colleagues to vote no.   Press reporters, at this time, and I yield the floor.  The

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Earlier in the debate I talked about the original Speaker of the House in 1833 had the same notion when he wrote that the Congress will not do away with the right of the people to keep and bear arms as they see fit; that they have it now in the Constitution and it is only because the Court has put it into the Constitution that we have this right in the first place. So this is a point of fairness and the first amendment back is the reason we are here.  The Prohibitions on Assault Weapons Act was introduced by Speaker Gingrich as part of a bill to ban assault weapons. This legislation will go a long way in getting criminals to understand that it is wrong to use the most powerful weapon that the United States has on the face of the Earth against the

Mr. President, the 1994 elections were elections about reform. Those of us sent here by the Republican Party to change this country thought we could make this country work for all the people without huge Government spending and special interests. We thought we could reform the welfare system by requiring work and not hand-out money at the welfare office to people who had not worked all their lives. It is just common sense.  Unfortunately, the people are not living it out the way we wanted them to, and the results are not what we expected. While the Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives and Senate by overwhelming majorities, they still cannot bring themselves to pass a bill to reform America's health care system because we do not have an answer to the issue of all the people losing their health care under the Democratic plan.

So to help seniors buy needed health care services and provide them better access to care, the majority will make drastic cuts in Medicare funding. And if Medicare funding is cut, seniors will have to spend more on out-of-pocket expenses like hospital bills.  But to the seniors and their doctors the other side of the aisle will say that Medicare is important because it is a safety net for our seniors. Yet despite the seniors being on Medicare all their lives and the doctors seeing them every day, many of them are making $9,000 to $10,000 a year less than the President promised and still will not have Medicare benefits because of the plan.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor survivors during National Gun Violence Survivors Week. Tragically, as we speak, another 91 Members of Congress are being gunned down in the line of duty. As president pro tempore of the American Legion, I understand the pain and the loss of all Americans.  However, on a personal level, I speak to the families and the loved ones that have lost loved ones, and I pray for our fallen heroes in this critical moment in time. As they are reunited with their loved ones, we honor the memories of the murdered and honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation.  On behalf of the American Legion and the future of the House of Representatives and the Senate, we ask this House to get back to working to address gun violence in this country.

Mr. President, I will just say in closing--and I would want spread on the record--that not only is it wrong for my colleagues to use this issue as a way to line the pockets of the wealthy and wealthy corporations, it is also wrong for the Senate to use that issue to line the pockets of the American people. To hold up the consideration of the so-called conference report to the balanced budget amendment is a vote to put the Senate on record as saying that it is time for us to bring the budget up-or-down. It is time for us to put the American people first and to pass the so-called bill of the House.  There is a fourth and fifth part of the budget agreement that is not included in the agreement, the agreement on the first bill of the conference. The agreement that has been entered into

So much for the notion of allowing everyone to conduct investigations without fear of being dragged into a partisan campaign or losing their jobs if they are successful in doing so.

The funding in this amendment would also be based on an ongoing plan to eliminate waste and fraud in the Federal regulatory programs.

Madam Speaker, today is the eighth anniversary of American involvement in Afghanistan. America will soon leave Afghanistan as the military must now deal with one of the most complex and difficult challenges in the history of the American nation. The fighting is going to be fierce and the costs are going to be substantial. But the American people and the people in this country are the ones who are most capable of helping the Afghans bring their country and its people together as best they can, even if it is at the cost of more American lives. America will never forget Afghanistan.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, I will be brief on the next two amendments. They relate to the procurement of more supplies for our troops to put more food on the table so they have more to eat while they are there. I hope they will be agreed to and passed today.  I also would like to add my voice to the chorus of concerned citizens across the United States who are demanding that Congress and the President step up to the plate and enact the ongoing supplemental which is now being discussed in Congress this week and fully debated by the Congress in our Appropriations Committee. That bill is being rushed to the floor. It has been dragged out by procedural threats made by the Republican leadership and Senate Democrats in the waning hours of the last Congress by delay tactics which certainly have had a devastating impact on the way this Senate has conducted its business this year with respect to

Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady. The gentlelady from Kansas, my good friend, who I know has had a long and distinguished record of not only dealing with America's economic and social problems but with education and social problems in this country, also recognizes that the bill today would allow the Federal Government to respond in two ways to the need for school districts in this country to ensure that their elementary and secondary students are getting the education that they need to be able to succeed in the future. So this is a good bill. It is an important bill for our country and for our children to have the opportunity to enjoy the future of this country without having the Federal Government come in and write us more mandates every time we have a problem and with less responsibility in the economy and with less ability to use our education dollars that we have to make sure that we

Just as the 2007 earthquake in New York was a wake-up call to Congress that Congress had failed to provide the same level of assistance to our own citizens as it had to those who had been the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the same will be the case in a possible earthquake in the Great Lakes. The same standard of justice should apply to Congress and our President as to New York and the other Great Lakes States which have been the victims of other large disasters in recent years.

Mr. President, agencies issue probably thousands of rules each year that pertain only to one party or another. Sometimes they are enacted to serve a point in Congress or to serve a constituency or to serve one kind of person or another. But sometimes they are passed because they are just simply issued. That is why we are currently considering and voting on an amendment that allows agencies to issue regulations to make it more likely that the rules they issue will be enforced without congressional intervention. We are doing that because regulations are the legislative equivalent of writing a bill for the Presidency to sign. They must be written by the experts and judged on their own merits.  The regulations issued by the Federal Government are governed by complicated and often conflicting rules and interpretations that are either existing or under review. These rules make a real difference in the everyday lives of American families,

Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. I rise today in opposition to the amendment of my good friend and colleague from Massachusetts on the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 2005. The amendment is the same as the amendment that we debated on the floor in May and that has been in the Senate for a full week now. It would keep the entire bill on the floor of the Senate and require the President to come to Congress to sign it because the American people are justifiably frustrated that the Government has not been more efficient in recent years. The legislation is time-sensitive and is a major expansion of existing authority that is already available to the Federal Government to be more efficient and a major provision of the budget resolution that we have had to make the biggest cuts in over a decade and $1 trillion to make the economy grow to a

We are losing our military men and women in the most dangerous part of the world because of tax cuts that we passed. The American people are not paying the bill. We are not doing our job here to keep this country safe and to provide those military paychecks. And we do not even know what the policies of the administration are. This is an important discussion that we need to have because the American people are not paying what they should be paying, and they are being asked to pay at a high rate by the Federal Government.

The legislation will ensure that the regulations that govern the Medicare reimbursement for the prescription drugs that are covered by the program continue to have the same force and effect for all drugs. And if a drug company has to increase its prices because a Congress has failed to fund it through the Medicare Program, the bill will ensure that a generic drug company has an opportunity to compete for the limited and low-income Medicare beneficiaries that provide the drug benefit and to be assured that the market will continue to be competitive for their product. This bill will also allow our senior citizens to see prescription drugs that they need more often,

It puts critical incentives back in the hands of law enforcement and taxpayers to build effective evidence-based law enforcement strategies for our Nation. We have a need to do what is right for the Nation, not what is easy or easy for law enforcement officials in Washington and they have responded very well with the reforms we have here. We know that the current system does not allow us to adequately target evidence in federal court and only strengthens an already weak criminal justice system in our country. We need to make those reforms right so that it does not hurt anybody. It is about accountability and fiscal responsibility for law enforcement to do their jobs and make tax dollars go to a better system of justice.

Mr. Chairman, if I may reclaim my time, let us not confuse whether or not this rule is in the best interest of the people of the United States of America. That should not be a reason for us to turn back time. The bill the gentleman from Florida is offering does not just require the Secretary of the Interior to take a look at the right to hunt or the right to fish. That could change any time they see fit to make that change. So I think it is an important point to make to everyone.  We believe in that right. We believe there ought to be legitimate hunting or fishing rights to preserve our heritage, and we believe that what you are suggesting would be detrimental to that right.  We have great concerns about the protections for Native American nations in this bill. We know what it does to the fisheries

I thank my colleague for his statements and would just want to explore this a little bit further with Senator Brown and say this is the old system that we had in the first place and the current administration still has to contend with and that is that we are being asked to vote for the largest tax increase in our country's history that will put our economy right back in the doldrums and not have us able to prepare for it and invest in our future and not go on to do what is going to put this country back on the path to having our growth back here with jobs and economic growth as a focus rather than simply looking back at our debt, if that is what the majority wants to do.  The fact of the matter is that is what we have been asked to do by the majority and it is not the direction

Res. 413 recognizes the positive work being done by the Holocaust Museum of Los Angeles County and the important contributions of the many museums in Los Angeles County to the preservation and exhibition of the Holocaust. I would also like to thank my friend and colleague Congresswoman Jackie Speier for introducing this legislation.  Congress passed the Congressional Gold Act in 1994 to ensure that Federal Government-sponsored Holocaust Museum exhibits are in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia. Since then, other federally funded museums such as the Smithsonian Institution and the National Gallery of Art have become more proactive in collecting the documentation and visual information necessary to better understand the events of the Holocaust and the suffering of so many innocent people during this dreadful period. To be sure, there are many individuals and institutions throughout

Mr. President, this is a fairly simple motion. It is to recommit, to cut the budget at the year 2006 levels and to give the administration the flexibility to make the tough decisions in a real way to save the Nation's food supply and to grow the economy. That motion is what the point of the previous amendment was, to make sure that there is a real increase in discretionary spending. We have already taken a good first step toward that because, obviously, at some time in the future, I hope we can resolve the problem of the sequester and get it to the President's desk.  We have $125 billion this year that is in the food assistance programs of all types of working poor, and we will probably be working on this and making these changes soon after the Thanksgiving holiday, so we ought to give the administration a little

There is an amendment that the President has offered that will make our surface transportation system more efficient and more competitive and not only will it require a $5 million per year increase in Federal funding for alternative financing for bridge construction, it also requires the development of effective and efficient transportation systems programs that involve the entire transportation system. That should be our goal.  We have the same amount of transportation system spending as the Federal Government on just one transportation project. We have over $4.5 trillion of transportation system spending in the United States of America, and over 80 percent of that Federal transportation spending is used by State governments for State transportation programs.

Yes. The funding is tied to estimates of natural disaster damages relayed to Congress by FEMA in their disaster report for that State or area. For example, FEMA has calculated that flood damage from Hurricane Andrew in Florida would cost them a million dollars to restore from which they then derive a natural disaster estimate. The natural disaster assessment provides relief from a user fee or tax of the Federal Government on the goods and services supplied to restore the damage caused by Hurricane Andrew.  Under current law, FEMA, as provided for in section 101(c) of the Emergency Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-358), which was enacted after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated the Gulf Coast States of Mississippi and Louisiana, is provided with appropriations and authorizations for these types of events.

Mr. President, back in 1985, I was a second-term Member of the House of Representatives when the budget agreement with the Senate was worked out that created this Federal budget framework in 1985. It was a unique and historic document, one which in a member's lifetime would be considered almost unheard of in American political history. In essence, the plan contained a balance of budget for the first time in history and more than five times what the Budget Enforcement Act had suggested. While I voted in favor of the agreement, I supported it largely because of the fact that it was based upon a philosophy and set of values I, and most of the Senate, held dear.

The bill before us today fails to contain or enforce provisions to address the ``death spiral'' with health care costs, the cost of ``prepayment'' of part B drugs and an increase in copayments. It ignores the need for reform in the long term, especially in the Medicare program, in order to deal with those serious problems and help more Americans get health care. I believe the legislation before us today fails to deal with some of the most important issues confronting American health care today.  As you know, I am

Continuing my reservation, Mr. President, as I understand the leader, it is not the minority side's intention to come to the floor unless there has been a vote on this issue in a period of 10 to 15 minutes in which we would bring the vote on this amendment to a vote within the unanimous consent agreement. Is that the leader's position?   Jurisdiction would be a continuing resolution for another 10 to 15 minutes or so for any votes the majority leader might take?   assignments from the National Security Committee's as to how much time the House will take, or how much they might use for other matters, would be equally divided in the caucus?                             {time}  1400 I am

In the Republican budget, we would change the tax policy, which has been more than good policy for America in the last 30 years, in the tax policy of this Congress and in the tax policy of the Congress that is coming forward in just a couple of weeks with the tax cuts of the House Republicans.  We would provide tax relief for middle-class families, economic security for hardworking Americans who have been trying to get by without a government of Washington, DC, and the Democratic Congress in Congress. We would give tax relief to the 40 million Americans who would benefit from the provision in this budget that the Republicans have not included in this budget is on unemployment insurance and health care reform for all of the American people. That is an important part of the Republican budget that we

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Appropriations Act, the largest defense spending bill in recent years. We have spent over $3 trillion in our country and added almost another $1 trillion to our national debt in the last decade alone.  And yet on August 3 the Senate passed a military appropriations bill that provides some hope to some military families who have been faced with uncertainty in the days since the President vetoed the defense bill last week. The military spending bill includes important military force development funding to keep our forces fighting and defending against emerging military threats around the world.  However, I am concerned about the entire military force structure and Army Corps of Engineers funding that are at stake in this bill as well. Last week I spoke at length about the two Corps of Engineers projects in my home State of Missouri

Mr. President, my home State of Oregon has long been known for being innovative in the area of health care delivery and the use of innovative State-supported provider-managed managed care plans to promote health care choice and competition in a number of areas including but not limited to primary care and home health care. This type of integrated system has been successful because it involves the private sector, community and State institutions and providers in the delivery of health care and also because it is one that does not compromise the fundamental and fundamental right of patients to choose the best health care they can get with their own money and with their own time.  The Oregon Health Plan was established by the legislature in 1988, the same year Oregon State University moved into the medical school at Oregon State. Through the model program, the Oregon Health Plan has focused on addressing the quality

Mr. Chairman, what troubles me is this legislation creates a Federal express line where the States will be able to create their own special programs that will cover that very purpose. That's a Federal express line that will not only not give us the flexibility that the States do already with regard to price competition, but this bill will provide for a major Federal mandate that the States do not have the opportunity to have some competition and have some environmental and environmental protection and enforcement authority that would not otherwise exist in this country. That is not only contrary to the provisions that the States have already passed for all purposes, but it is a major new Federal power to the States. It has not been tried anywhere before.

Mr. President, as Republicans and Democrats debate the best way to reform health care, Americans are hurting and a great deal of Americans are struggling with a higher-than-expected cost of living. A recent National Health Care Cost Survey showed that the typical consumer will see their annual cost increase of almost $1,200 by the end of the year. That is a significant and growing burden on every family and business in America today, and many Americans are experiencing problems and challenges in their jobs or households that have never been experienced before or have not been experienced before in their entire lives. Americans are hurting. They want their Representatives to help solve these problems. Their problem is that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree to increase our economy's opportunity to create jobs and gain economic prosperity.  For me, there is no question that health care is a critical issue

For the past several years, the rate at which money is spent by the Federal Government to implement the FDA drug approval process has been rising at the rate of about 30 percent a year and is now over 400 percent a year. The FDA has been cut back on at the highest level in years and this has also had a negative impact on our law enforcement agencies, with an estimated $18 million cut in drug enforcement agents and other personnel this year alone.  Our drug policy is not the only one that is being reordered in a drastic way. Last year Customs, Border Patrol and Internal Revenue Service were all slashed by more than half.

Mr. Speaker, as summer turns towards winter, the American people will continue to face high unemployment and economic uncertainty. Yet instead of addressing these economic challenges to improve our economic growth and create more opportunities for our country, the Bush administration has become the antithesis of growth and opportunity. The Bush administration has not only failed to improve our economic growth but has actually created many jobs by eliminating and reducing many jobs that the Bush administration began in 2003. It is clear the Bush administration is in the business of creating more unemployment rather than creating jobs in the areas of the economy that need jobs the most. Last week alone, 8 percent of the jobs created in the States that have no unemployment compensation were related to the Bush administration tax cuts that have added $2 trillion to our debt. Those jobs are not part of the work force of this country that will

The first time in our Nation's history that we have used our debt limit to raise funds to pay the interest on the national debt was in 1956 in the so-called Social Security surplus years.

These are necessary to ensure that electronic information systems used by public utility companies are not being manipulated in an attempt to influence public policy decisions or the outcome of litigation on the part of public utilities. While electronic information systems and other technology are used today for a range of legitimate purposes, we must review the legislation and conduct oversight and audits to ensure that the laws that we enact for the purposes of public safety are applied with caution and thought.  Recently, the Food and Drug Administration and the general public have become aware of concerns that certain over-the-

Mr. President, just very briefly, one of the biggest fights we have had about this bill has been over the issue of what we are going to do to the technology that we are going to be talking about later on on about. We are not going to take this one step too far because technology is one of the most important things we have to do to make sure we are running a country in which all our people are well fed and have good health care so we can keep our economic engine going and make sure we do not get into a deep economic recession that would result in the kind of disaster that this country has seen in the last 10 or 15 years. We do not want to go that route because we do not want to get to the point of our ability to keep our economy moving when this country has a kind of a weak

So when we look at all the mandates, the new requirements in the legislation, the revenue provisions in this legislation as we start to take up those programs that are taken care of in the last week in October of this year that it is a fact that as a result of the President not working this out when he signed legislation in 1995 that we have a law that in the first 10 months of this year will spend about $50 billion more than the law that was enacted last week on the issue of mandates and revenue provisions.  In other words, in order to comply with that law last week, we have had to divert our attention from a very pressing issue that faces us today; a tax issue that confronts us today. How much more could we be doing under this situation if the President would have worked that out when he signed the legislation

Mr. Speaker, fixing our Nation's crumbling infrastructure to boost the economy and increase transportation safety is a bipartisan priority. In a time of tight budget and tight resources, I believe that public safety investment is a smart investment that will create jobs and boost economic activity across our country. As the ranking Republican on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased that the Senate is taking serious action on this issue and has included in their final fiscal year 2017 Transportation Appropriations bill a $32 million block grant for a study of the feasibility of surface transportation systems in communities across the country. This study would analyze the cost savings associated with hiring the better educated and more trained to maintain those systems, as well as developing the best means of intermodal transportation to save money in Federal spending. I applaud the committee for including these critical funding dollars and look forward to working with

We should not pretend that the decision to buy the United States is a rational one and the only way to deal with it is not to get into this debate about it. It is not rational to not help the American people understand this point of view. That is not our objective, that is not how to do business in Washington, DC.

Last Friday, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to take any action against a memo that challenged the limits placed on overtime pay by the NLRB.

This year is different because we have a bill that addresses a much more important and pressing issue than others have addressed already in this century and we are considering this very bill that also has major economic and military implications for our country. What would be a normal part of an appropriations bill, more usually because we deal with more government business but also because we have to try to accommodate amendments and to work with some of our colleagues on our side of the aisle to make these ideas more acceptable and less controversial, would be what I would call a national security issue bill for us

The Clinton plan is generous for children and families who already pay the highest taxes in the Nation, including those on prescription drugs.  But I will say this more directly to the other side, the Clinton plan is not only adequate to pay for it. This side benefits. This side spends more on Head Start. We have had Federal spending cut by $46 billion under the Clinton plan. We have had tax cuts for big corporations, the largest ones in the country.

If the gentleman will allow me to clarify, the Speaker does have authority to give specific orders if circumstances require the direction of law enforcement to act. It does not require that it be done by the Congress as a law, it simply gives law enforcement the authority to act and ensures that the authority of the Speaker is in place to make those decisions in those circumstances. So we do not want to cause unnecessary confusion in any way that the rule may lead people to believe or be led to believe that it does not exist.   fodder is both sides agree that the Federal judiciary ought not to be empowered by the Federal Government to restrain the ability of law enforcement to act on its own and enforce its own laws

Mr. President, I commend our distinguished leader for addressing this matter which is of extraordinary importance to the people of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the members of the United States Armed Forces in the Armed Forces of the United States of America. This amendment has been passed by the Senate several times. The first time was by a large majority of the full Senate only to be stalled before it could come to the floor for an up-or-down vote. We have been through that before again today. This time the matter has been passed on the ground for this to be considered by the Senate today for what it is, which is our once and for all recognition of the First Responders and their commitment and sacrifice to our country and the members of the Armed Forces in our Armed Forces in the United States of America who are serving

This is about the $20 billion that goes to the banks with loans that should be given to the States to help them build housing. What we want to talk about today is the $10 billion that goes to the banks to help the States build down stock up here in the United States of America and to get dollars that they ought to go on to invest in a variety of different industries

Mr. President, Senator Exon's amendment to restore $15 billion in agricultural spending is a step in the right direction and will reduce the deficit by $25 billion over the next 5 years. This amendment also includes some other more modest reductions of spending that we have been looking at over the past several years as well. The amendment also requires the administration to review the cuts in these programs and provide to Congress and the American people a clear plan to reduce spending over time in the coming years without further raising the Nation's debt ceiling. The amendment has the support of the American Farm Bureau, the Department of Agriculture, the American farm banking industry, and the Food Stamp Program.

Mr. Speaker, today, the House is considering a rule for the consideration of two bills, H.R. 3864 and H.R. 3869, to reform the Federal child support enforcement system, and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. These bills passed the House on April 4 and the Senate on April 8, but were not sent to the President for his signature before the new Congress convened earlier this month. H.R. 3864 and H.R. 3869 are needed reforms to help address the many problems that have plagued the system. There is a growing Federal demand for child support enforcement action which requires government responsibility for monitoring the custody of children in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. The courts have become a forum for the Federal Government to impose the Federal Government's will on a State and local system

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is all about taking American jobs and eliminating the unnecessary burdens of the U.S. Government in America. If it is really important to Washington that American companies compete on the world market, then Americans should make their own decisions about those foreign competitors. But if we are only concerned about whether or not they may produce what we want in America, then some of those decisions ought to be made by the State or local governments in our own country. To the degree that they can even make that decision, in some instances they will have less incentive to compete because we have provisions in this legislation to bring pressure to bear on them.  These provisions in the bill allow States to place a cap on certain fees and the requirements they impose. We want to encourage competition

Mr. President, to me it is simply unconscionable that the Food and Drug Administration, one of the Federal Government's most important regulatory agencies, has failed to act on a much-needed amendment to the bill that would address the critical issue of drug safety and efficacy.  It has been more than a decade since the FDA promulgated final rules that govern the importation of many medicines. These FDA products are vital to millions of Americans. At the same time the FDA regulates the small firms that make them, it fails to adequately protect the public health. In one case the safety of a medicine was exposed when bacteria were found in the digestive tract of a woman who took it. In another, when the FDA ruled that iron deficiency anemia was an FDA-approved condition, we found that it had indeed taken until 2006, before the FDA came

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3426, legislation to amend the United States-Israel Constitution to require the President to seek congressional approval before establishing a peace agreement between the United States and the Government of the State of Israel. This bill provides Congress an opportunity to express its consent to such an agreement in a nonbinding resolution that would apply to such a peace agreement for the first time. This bill also provides for a provision of debate on the agreement by which Congressional approval would be required prior to any subsequent agreement entered into by the United States or the government of Israel.  This legislation is similar to legislation that was enacted last year in the House of Representatives by a vote of 366 to 20.

That is not the problem.

Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution gave the executive branch of our Government authority to provide for the payment of debts incurred by the executive branch of our Government. They set aside the power to levy taxes in general as unconstitutional. President Lincoln followed in their footsteps, signed into law the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.  In the intervening years since, there have been efforts to insert or modify this constitutional amendment, among them at the State level, and at the Federal level. Those efforts have been met with an unrelenting public opinion campaign, and a continuing determination to repeal it. While the Framers of the Constitution believed in congressional control of the purse strings, so did their detractors.  This week, we hope to make amends with this Nation's Constitution by extending the concept of congressional control over the payment of Federal debt.

Last month the State Highway Commission authorized a study of the St. Lucie County Airport in my district, the Nation's eighth busiest airport. The study and accompanying public comment was extremely important to St. Lucie County because it would know what the air traffic and the airport needs are and when they need to be addressed to better serve the people of south Florida.

But as the Senator's chart demonstrates, if you adjust that for inflation, what your GDP, you can see the difference. If you adjust for inflation as a percent of the national income for the last 15 years, you have increased the share of tax revenues to the Federal Government from 57 percent to 78 percent. But if you don't adjust for inflation, you have a very small--relatively small--increase in that amount.  If you look at the other side of the equation, you have a more dramatic and dramatic increase in the amount of taxes imposed by the Federal Government--to the point that in the President's budget and the version of his budget before us tonight, the projections under a Republican and a Democratic House are now the same, the same totals--as high as 90 percent of the revenue from the pockets of the

This action represents a significant step toward ending the threat to the security of our Nation that the senseless genocide of the Central African Republic has created.  Last month, in a vote of 98 to 3, the Senate approved an effort by the Clinton administration to have the Central African Republic Organization suspended due to the horrific recent actions

I thank my colleague for that information. Reclaiming my time, the pension bill, as the Senator knows, is a much broader and far more comprehensive reform of our pension system than we have previously known it to be because the committee worked and had a tremendous amount of input from both the private and public sector in developing this legislation and in developing this particular amendment. And the people on the committee were quite right to do that. We have yet to see this legislation on the floor because we have not done a comprehensive reform of our pension system that will help us meet the needs of our society and our country with what the people need in their pension system and that their constituents need for the next decade and longer. So I just wanted to clarify the amendment that the Senator from Ohio has offered which was reported to the committee and made in order by the managers

Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of the bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act [EESA] for the remainder of fiscal year 2007. I would first like to thank the chair and the ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senators Frist and Inouye, for their leadership on the legislation and also the many other Members of the Senate who have worked to make the legislation possible. I am especially pleased that the Banking Committee and the Finance Committee have also worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure that this legislation will receive a very strong bipartisan vote.  As was the case for most of the legislation that we have considered so far this fiscal year, the legislation will not only provide for the ongoing needs of our economy and economy-wide economic recovery but will also provide us with

Madam President, yesterday President Trump and Republican leaders once again tried to sit down with Democrats and negotiate something that would get our country back on its feet. They tried to negotiate something that would resolve our differences with the President on Syria and our concerns about our allies that do not like the way the President has handled the response to Syria. Instead of getting the basic issue addressed and resolving it with our allies, this resolution is a quick opportunity for the House to essentially ignore our proposal and go back to the Middle East War going on today.  We have a compromise. It is a solution in search of a problem. It is about saving lives and protecting our security.  Just in the last 5 years, the war in the Middle East has cost the American taxpayer $115 billion, including $10 billion for the fight in Afghanistan and about

Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely correct. Current law does not require them to use the rate if they have already paid the rate or there is no rate available. Because of that not requiring it now would really be like the gentleman saying to you that you absolutely cannot use your present pension plan for at least a year if you have already paid the pension plan.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>                                         {_item,       ``In such such Life, as Heaven shall shew Me, I am the same which I was.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 28; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume legislative session.  The  tombstone of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justices Scalia and Thomas could soon be in the building in this Chamber as the next two Justices are announced in the only election between two new Members of this body to make history as the first African-American to serve in the Court.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Edward Robb ``Ted'' Barrett. Ted was an all-American family man who was dedicated to his family, to his faith and to his country and who fought the good fight for his family and for America as a whole. We have all experienced the good life through Ted as we have watched his commitment to service, his faith, his country and to the Constitution we both enjoy so much.  The time I had the honor of being able to attend Ted's funeral service was especially moving to me because it brought back many memories I had when I last saw Ted back in 2004 in Madison. I could not be more proud to be there and to have been able to meet and pay tribute to one of the greatest patriots the world has ever known.  I feel honored to stand with

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, they could, only where necessary to protect human life or the security of people who live in areas where there is potential for mass destruction or would be needed for protection of public health or safety or those who are on the top of the food chain as this would apply here and allow them to go and get that kind of food while they are in the country as the law of supply and demand would allow them to do so and we would get that provision in. But we have to make sure the farmers can get the supplies that they need so they can keep the food supply as they grow it and keep people safe and keep the price of food down. That is what this would do.  We are all for farmers, and they need to be able to get the supplies they need in order to produce the food

Mr. Speaker, last year I stood in this well and called on my colleagues to increase funding for defense. At the time, this was my first post-September 11 resolution of disapproval, because funding for defense was not sufficient to adequately address the threats our country faces today, and those threats could only be improved by increased investments in programs which are essential to our national security and economic well-being. I would make the same call this time and I would offer another resolution of disapproval to provide additional funds for the military. I am committed to building the best military in the world.  But despite my past record, I have been assured that I would still have the opportunity to defeat this previous appropriation, and so I will vote no. The Department of Defense's actions in Iraq are shameful, and I wish to ask my colleagues to stand

Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), the bill's chief sponsor and coauthor of the amendment, who deserves special recognition for the exemplary work that he has done to make this a better bill for his colleagues.   Onto the discussion of the warrantless eavesdropping program. For the past 4 years there has been a lot of discussion about this program. No one questions that we should have a warrantless eavesdropping program. It is legal under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. The point of this amendment is to protect our rights under the Fourth Amendment. It is not to give the Government the ability to get that information without any warrant that we have in the United States Congress. Now, that is an extremely valuable right to have, and it has to be provided in order to meet the

On Wednesday, following morning business, the Senate will resume the FAA bill and the pending Transportation Appropriations bill under a previous order. We will vote in relation to the Transportation Appropriations bill at approximately 10:30 today to be followed by the Health Care bill. Senators should be prepared to be in the Chamber late into the evening to debate and to allow those who have amendments to offer them as well as those who have made statements which we would like to have the Record reflect by 10:30 this afternoon as to whether that will be possible because we will have Members on the floor as well as the Senate then to discuss any time agreements they might have on the other side of that agreement. It is still our intent to complete this entire bill this week if we can make progress on it as it goes along. And there will be a continuing series of

Mr. Speaker I am very aware of it, and for that reason it becomes meaningless. What we are talking about is the ability to have the debate on both sides to put in a budget so that we can work together to be able to do what we want to do, but we also know that a lot of people in this room are very aware of it and that the other side of the aisle are very aware of it.  The bottom line is that this bill has not come out of the Senate Budget Committee. It has not come out of the Budget Committee on this side of the aisle. It has not come out of the Budget Committee on the other side of the aisle. It has not come out from the Budget Committee on the Appropriations Committee. We have put a plan out of the Senate that the other side has refused to accept

Madam President, I wish to thank the Chair and my colleague from Georgia who understood the importance of the amendment and who also fully supported it, and his colleague from Alabama who served as Chair of the Budget Committee on which I have the honor of serving now for the past several years as well.  This amendment is one that the leadership is very pleased with and one that should not be too hard to support. It is an amendment to correct the fact that when the Government started shutting down, some on the other side of the aisle and even some on the other side of the building started saying that if we adopted this amendment that it would be an emergency and they would use the $150 billion contingency fund. This has not happened. The Budget Committee has held several hearings on this and the Government has not shut down over the past several days

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1335 would amend the Outstanding Credit Products Act to extend the deadline for issuing credit cards and large purchases for 1 year. The 9/11 Commission initially issued a recommendation that the government quickly establish a 15-day date for national security clearance and a 5-day date for large purchases, but it was later changed to 4 days in October 2002 to avoid disruption in international credit markets. The 9/11 Commission also recommended that financial institutions provide credit to a limited number of terrorists following October 11 through January 8 2001 and to those in the United States at the end of that period following March 19 through September 18 of this year.  If these requirements are not met by the 5-day deadline set forth by the 9/11 Commission, credit card and large purchases

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would remind Members that we have no objection to the amendment of the gentleman from Louisiana who will be offering his second-degree amendment. It has some well-known Members of Congress who have a very clear interest in the $3 million increase in the United States Commission on Civil Rights in this bill. It has a very small amount of money. We think that the amount is very appropriate. We think it makes a very big difference to the important work of the Federal Government that it does in good conscience. I would note that it has no force of law and has not been acted upon by the Senate, I understand, because it is a more charitable and less heavy-handed bill than the bill that the gentleman from Louisiana has offered, and I think it makes a

Mr. Speaker, this is a moment of fact.

I am reminded of a friend of mine, when I was the Secretary of State at State, who, as Secretary of the Army then, said what happened back then in Korea is what we know to be true today. He said that you cannot read into history any one event to tell what happened then. He said you can tell what happened if you really look very deeply at it, because I had an opportunity to sit down with what happened, I think, about 3 years ago. I have been to Korea myself, and I do not think there is any question that the Koreans are much better today than they were back in the 1950s. They have been very aggressive in eliminating that cancer that was born during the last century of their lives.  I do not think we do our job when we talk about this as if we

Mr. Speaker, I simply want to respond to one theme that we have heard here this evening.  Last year the Speaker of the House, the previous speaker the distinguished gentleman from Illinois, predicted that this day would come that the Congress would enact a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I would point out, as you know, we now have had 10 consecutive balanced budget years. The last time we had that was over 13 years ago and we have had eight successive years of budget deficits in this country. The record is clear.  What we are trying to achieve, as we heard tonight, is to get the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives and Senate to make some small improvements in our budget this year, in order to bring us in line with the projections of the national economy, in order to try and put a little more

I am talking about the heart and soul of welfare policy; I am not talking about some little amendment that has been around a long time or has been passed by Congress for many years. We are talking about a President who has sent to this Congress a budget that was determined by a Congressional Budget Office under the leadership of two Democrats in the House of Representatives. His budget assumes $58.5 billion of reductions in programs that were included in the budget that the President submitted to the Congress. It is $56 billion below the House-passed version of this budget. I just want to say again, in light of the information that is now coming out, I just find it amazing that it seems to me it is so much easier to stack more on top of each other in the Senate than it is for the President to serve with
