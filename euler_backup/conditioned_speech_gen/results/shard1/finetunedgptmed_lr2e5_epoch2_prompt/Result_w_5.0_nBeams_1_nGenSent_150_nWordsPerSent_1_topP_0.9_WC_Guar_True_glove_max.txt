criteria make elements 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states that the commercial sale or use of these materials could be made using criteria that will improve the efficiency of the energy we need to make domestic fuels for domestic use. This is critical to America and our environment and yet it would be inappropriate for the regulated agencies of this country to have such elements of their own manufacture that could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions or address significant hazards to our environment.  I commend my colleague from Virginia, the chairman, and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula], the ranking member, for crafting a comprehensive energy-saving bill that, indeed, accomplishes goals that should be desirable. I commend them for their work in passing a bill that tackles some of the most important issues facing this Nation as we seek to balance our economic

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I think is an excellent amendment that the Senator from California just put on the table that will go some way to help our people who are trying to be able to get back to work in this economy right now. I think it is very important that we understand what it is we are talking about and what we are doing real quickly and why it is so important.  The amendment that is being debated is something that I think is an abuse of the system, so I am glad to support the amendment because of that.

I agree that osteoporosis should be the focus of aggressive detection, prevention and treatment activities. Diabetes is a disease that afflicts millions of Americans and is the leading cause of disability and premature death in our Nation and other developed countries. Many of those diabetes patients have families living generations of their lives, so diabetes can impact their health at any age. Diabetes can cause complications like kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and blindness, which owe much to insulin deficiency.

Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is necessary to limit the Federal Government's power to spend more and more of American citizens' hard-earned money in ways that do not help America meet its economic obligations to reduce our deficits. The balanced budget amendment will strengthen Congress' authority to balance the budget through annual appropriation legislation.  The amendment would require the Federal Government to limit its spending to a 3 percent annual inflationary rate in amounts financed by borrowing the interest rates of other nations.  This amendment would restore the authority of Congress to institute an inflationary test at a 2-percent rate.  Furthermore, this amendment would require the President to notify Congress and the American people of the Federal deficit when inflation exceeds 2 percent for a period of 1 year.

Just to clarify, Mr. Chairman, I received a full 15 minutes. If the gentleman from Florida wanted to speak in that time that would be just fine.  I simply point out that this amendment does not affect the gentleman's amendment or the ranking member's amendment in any way. As the chairman mentioned, there is no change in the bill as it currently stands and the amendment to Illinois No. 645 is not controversial.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I think the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) got right to the heart of what the American people want. We know what they want.

In recent years, we have witnessed a significant shift in the nature of jobs and career opportunities. Our local workforce investment system is well suited to meet these changing needs. For instance, an increasing number of highly skilled and high education workers are retiring from the American workforce.

So, let us get something out of the way. The waivers that are done in this legislation in fact, as the gentleman from Colorado pointed out, will allow a great many families, the so-called dual-income families, that it will not be very practical to have a $6,500 maximum exemption, which was basically cut by more than $700,000, while there is a shortfall in the Pentagon's appropriations bill.

I thank the Speaker. Mr. Speaker, when will the gentlewoman recognize the fact that the House is really not the American people's business, that it is the United States of America that is able to do this? We are not the only ones that have to work for this solution; we are just the ones who are building this system, and now is the time for it.  Mr. Speaker, I was surprised when the other day, a few minutes ago on the wagon, when a lady said to me, ``Why can't you see that government is creating the most sustainable model of economic growth in our history, the most profitable model?''  She said, ``Well, why can't you see how free enterprise works? That is what the American people want, their freedom to choose.'' She was very critical.  Well

Mr. President, it is easy to see why earmarking is held so dear to so many in this body. In a place where Members will never forget the first time they were handed a committee hearing on a proposal that they never even intended for the United States Senate to consider in the first place, it is hard to imagine how their colleagues would hold dear such a good idea for one second longer than they would hold the idea held dear to their own noses, or at least hold the proposal held dear to the earmark's own nose.  It is hard to believe that the overwhelming majority of the Senate has never been able to begin to tap their own earmarks in the first place. It is not as though this place is in any way a new place where people in office take advantage of a requirement that cannot be waived. We all

I would like to specifically point to the fact that Colombia now has been admitted to the World Trade Organization and this increase in funds will help to increase involvement and build up trade relations in that country.

The most important of those are:  There should be immigration enforcement. The question is, will we enforce immigration laws?

I will accept that compensation as long as it is paid for and never implies anything about restricting freedom of speech.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, it is surely a shame that it is necessary in the year 2019 to spend $1.2 trillion of our hard-earned tax dollars on a few of the most fundamental and damaging effects of climate change. While Congress has been working to resolve serious consequences from COVID-19, it is clear that the House is even more a part of the problem than the White House. This House failed to take leadership on COVID-19, Speaker Ryan is today.  If the White House does not plan to negotiate in good faith, Democrats will continue to use every tool at our disposal, regardless of the damage caused, to let the administration and Republican Members know what they want and how they want us to do it.  We won't back down and we won't put our people, taxpayers, and our environment at

Madam President, I say to my colleagues, I would be more than pleased to defer for a couple of minutes to respond to the amendment. We are talking about very different ways that we could communicate to people on the other side of the aisle why this does not really help them understand why the discussion is not working to actually make us a better nation because people do not speak to one another in a deliberate way. They do not really speak to one another philosophically, but they do not really speak to one another in the natural way that we ought to.  I wish, Madam President, we would have time to explain what this is really all about.

I am disappointed that we are having to go through this amendment again because the rhetoric seems to get worse and worse. And when it comes to food aid hungry Americans have fewer options, they are getting less, and they are seeing more of a Federal Government take over our food systems.  As most Americans know, when there is food aid, we don't wait for hours for us to get our hands on this.

Madam President, let me compliment the distinguished Democratic leader for his effort to get an agreement on the agriculture appropriations bill to be brought to the floor later this week because that is very important to the agriculture industry in America that would be done with the many changes made here, as well as the livestock, and the energy bill and the transportation bill.  This is something that will be, I think, both temporary and bipartisan. I compliment the distinguished Democratic leader for his attempt to do it quickly. I commend the minority leader for his diligence in getting this done. We do not want to delay any efforts in the Government--whether it is agriculture, food, transportation, or any other part of the Government. We hope that we can do that tomorrow, perhaps not early, but soon.  We are now ready to move to final passage

Mr. President, the 1994 elections were elections about reform. Those of us sent here by the American people want reform that will be good for the Nation and make Congress accountable. We want to make Congress accountable to the Constitution and the laws we pass to protect, defend, and preserve our system of government. As the most representative body in the world, we expect it to be accountable.  My vote against the budget resolution is not because I oppose legislation that is good for America. I voted against the budget resolution because it was not good for Congress, it was not good for the American people, and it wasn't good for our Nation. The budget resolution ignored the realities of our Nation's economic situation and the fact that 7.2 million Americans have fallen below the poverty line since 1992. It threw out the budgets of 12 million working families

The Federal Reserve Board will even turn off the brakes if inflation rises above that rate to as much as 4 percent.  That is what the economic recovery can do when the Fed really wants to raise interest rates. We have got to bring it to an end so that Americans can get back to work so that our Government can continue to pay down the massive Federal debt that people have to kill so it doesn't have to cut the food stamp program and the LIHEAP program and the seniors and people working in this country who need health care.

Mr. Speaker, under the guise of saving Medicare, the majority would make funding cuts that are intended to give big pharmaceutical companies even more money to cover health care costs for seniors without saving any money for the average taxpayer. Not the plan that the American people are funding.  According to a bipartisan budget group that supports the Medicare guarantee, a plan that cuts funding to reduce seniors' health care costs by a third in real dollars by the year 2002, seniors would get their health care bills on time and costs would go down without these cuts. The budget plan, the majority's plan to give big pharmaceutical companies even more money to cover health care costs for seniors without saving any money for the average taxpayer, fails to do either.

Unfortunately, the reform debate has become a partisan debate as the Republican majority has failed to act in an honest, bipartisan manner with Democratic Senators. Despite bipartisan support for reforms to our health care system, the American people are told they should have only one choice of insurance carrier--a choice that usually includes doctors, hospitals, drug companies, and private insurers. While this is a laudable goal, it is a choice that people in my State of Florida and many other States are told they simply cannot make.

Mr. President, I will just say in closing--and I would want spread on the record--that I believe this is the greatest crisis facing the country today because we are having to do what is called the Bush policy which says we are going to deal with the issue of trade, which means all the President has to do is appoint all the ambassadors to the other countries that he does not want to deal with but he wants to give the opportunity for the conference, which is in the Finance Committee and the Small Business Committee, the responsibility of the House of Representatives to pass the legislation that he says he wants his Henry Hyde act, which will restrict all trade, without subjecting any country to this restriction. So I do not know why anybody thinks we are taking things out of any of the business of the House of Representatives, which is to do the right

These documents are in fact critical to congressional oversight of how the U.S. Government reacted when they watched this highly questionable oil sale go through and could help Congress figure out whether the U.S. Government has misused taxpayer dollars for economic or political purposes.  American taxpayers are demanding that Congress fulfill its responsibility to check the mismanagement of the U.S. energy policy by investigating and holding responsible the administration and Members of Congress who played a role in these mismanagement. Let's get those documents before the Committee on Appropriations.

The bill that Congress passed left 6 million children behind, and it will leave another 40 million without the help they need to get on their feet and be productive members of the American family as adults and as parents. Speaker Gingrich has said that the plan he is pushing will ``take away welfare. It's time for it to go.'' Let us hope he fails.  After years of pretending that they would help the disadvantaged, the Republicans are now claiming that the Republicans have the courage to act. They can no longer lead us into a new era of      accountability, support, and restoration of opportunity for children. Today,

Mr. Speaker, the Iran Missile Proliferation Sanctions Act of 1997 is intended to close loopholes that make it difficult for the United States to impose sanctions on the Iranian Government and the governments of Iraq and Pakistan and other foreign state sponsors of terrorism because congressional intent and congressional legislative intent was that Congress require that the Senate passes the legislation, and Congress then use its authority under section 240(b) of the Congressional Budget Act to make necessary reductions in defense spending in order to achieve a savings in all appropriations bills in the next fiscal year.  The current authorization level for this legislation is $150 million. To achieve a savings of $22.5 million in budget authority and $29 million in outlays for 1997, the bill would require reductions in all nondefense discretionary spending categories below the current authorization level, and $9.5 million of base

Second, we need to make sure those who are our biggest enemies at the Federal level are not in a position of strong enough influence to inhibit or intimidate States. That means, not when the Governor of a State wants to make sure her school system provides parents with the education they want and need for their child's future.

I asked them to explain a little bit on the bill that is being voted on in the Senate and in the House this week and they do not have an answer to the White House and the White House did not answer it as well. They gave me three scores of just the payrolls for all of the information we asked them. Not just payroll but payroll information.

I will make a closing statement to the third amendment and put it up on a bill that the Armed Services Committee has jurisdiction on, and that amendment will allow us to test if we can shoot down incoming missiles.

Mr. President, the events of September 11, 2001, changed our Nation. In the aftermath of that attack, we learned much about who we were as a nation and what our values were. Despite the urgent call to action, we were less than able to perform our important duties. Indeed, Mr. President, the United States failed to respond, leading to the 9/11 Commission's conclusion that the American people needed action to control our borders, improve homeland security, and combat terrorism.

The Federal Government should not use public funds to fund investments that are not wise, that will not be revenue-raising for the Federal Government and that will cost more in taxes than they pay back in dollars. The $2 trillion credit is going to cost taxpayers billions of dollars in lost revenue in the years ahead.  It will stimulate economic growth in the communities and communities of Georgia. It will also reduce land values.  The record of this administration is the opposite of what I would want for the American people to see when I look at these tax incentives for development in our country.

Medicare part D. Now, with great fanfare in the dark of the night, this Congress gave over 15 million of these millions of dollars to large pharmaceutical companies at their most profitable with the stated intention of saving money for the Federal Government. They gave this money to these companies not just to increase their number of employees, but to increase the company profits for years to come through increased drug prices because they required all this enormous cost to sell the drugs to the government which they would get approval to prescribe.  Now, there is a small way for the American taxpayer to be able to try to find a way to really find some reform in Medicare part D and in Medicare so that we are not paying for the drug companies' profits. You can reach a conclusion that the average American taxpayer will not find a way to pay for the drugs being made at

We certainly have never demonstrated that in any serious way. Sandy Jencks, at Northwestern University, where she teaches economics, has testified that eliminating the cash welfare system in this country would cost the State and local governments somewhere between $100 and $200 billion over the next 30 years. In other words, if we're going to be as effective in urban areas as we can possibly be and care as much about children as the State and local governments in the State and local areas, and in northern northern northwestern Ohio are trying to care as much about children as the State and local governments in the State and local areas, we ought to be as effective as possible in all of the different areas of government. We don't have a system that provides a welfare system that is not risky and that doesn't pay very well. We do have a system that gives

It does nothing to make health care more accessible to all of America's citizens or to many of our most vulnerable citizens and to the millions of other people who struggle daily with lack of health care and opposition to access to adequate health care.  This bill raises taxes and will cause the costs of health care to increase across the board for every American.

Small businesses have been driven to the margins in this country in the last decade to pay taxes that often don't make sense.  It's a fact that small business--those with fewer than 10 employees--generated just $236 billion in revenues in 2011, and this tax burden is slowly dragging them back down.

I think everybody in this Chamber, Republican and Democrat, and all the American people know the day that happens, I say to my friend from Kentucky, is the day that we all get together, let us get together to find a bipartisan way to cut spending in Washington so that America can get back to work.  I think it was Benjamin Franklin who said it best when he said, ``With the passage of time, the need for wisdom grows great. That wisdom lies in considering a wrong well which we think perhaps we have cleared

Mr. Speaker, last week on the east front outside the Capitol on the lawn, I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell who had met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and others and had a high level of confidence in the ability of the Iraqi army and the people of that country to have a more stable and more effective and less likely to cause another age of violence as it tried to obtain independence. They were very concerned about this new Sunni problem in Iraq, a Sunni problem in Iraq. So I was pleased when this Congress and the Senate agreed to send a strong signal to the new Iraqi President and this Congress and the Congress of the United States that we were not going to send their troops into another confrontation.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank both of these

Mr. President, what this amendment does is deal with innovative bridge research and construction. There is some good work going on now in the transportation programs. Many transportation projects today have a good environmental safety record and they are approved by the President for use in national transportation. But there is a problem that should be dealt with before we pass a bill, because the bridge will never be finished. The bridges would never be constructed, because it takes to a deadline longer than a year to establish a project. So the program must be changed. We must go forward with a long-term program. We can do something for the chemical bridges, which cost billions of dollars.  The one that is presented, for example, is going to produce a lot of utility and create many jobs. The right answer, as we hope to do this year, is

We need military forces, now that we have a posture where we can attack them without a declaration of war or a military retreat, we need military forces and that means having the right forces on the ground to support them as they take their country to regain their autonomy and get back to their sovereign and democratic way of life.

Mr. Speaker, I have opposed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy since its inception in 2004, and I will continue to do so in the days and weeks to come if we are to have an end to this harmful policy for American men and women. The continued policy of including our men and women in overseas combat for just a few days here and there without the full protections of the more than 40 years of the 18 and 25 year old age people of the Armed Forces as codified in the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy was a mistake from the very first day.  As a former college football coach and a Marine myself, I recognize the good intentions of our military that allow them to have that next meal, to plan for the possibility that their son or daughter will not face a premature deployment, but when we consider the great

Mr. President, I rise this morning to recognize the Reverend Elliot Foss, who is our Chaplain for today and the last day of the 114th Congress of the United States. In the midst of a great tragedy for this great country, this Chaplain has come here and gave us his time and the rest of the time of the people of this great Nation as they have mourned the loss of the great fire kings.  I personally think it is his courage and his respect for our flag, which I am sure many Americans have a far greater regard for, that this President has kept Foss' attendance low today so that the entire body of the people of the United States could not possibly miss this opening prayer.  Mr. President, this great Nation honors Reverend Foss today not just for his words in our Declaration of Independence, which surely

He has been a constant and he has been a very effective advocate for EPA in a very bipartisan fashion, having been one of the best in the Senate on matters of EPA.

I support efforts to rein in rising health care costs and to enact commonsense health care reform that has made such a difference in the lives of Americans all across this great land.

Congress continues to get back and get away from the issues that our constituents in every part of this country want and need to have addressed in their communities.  The chairman and the ranking member have done a great job this time around because we have passed a wrecking ball--crackdown on Wall Street--not Wall Street, as many of the people think, but on Wall Street. I love the CEO's who lost over $400 million in the collapse of the economy. As a matter of fact, I think it was the largest loss of corporate money ever. Most of these are small businesses.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my friend's amendment. For the past several years, I have been a strong advocate for this Agency for International Development. I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from West Virginia.  I fully agree that development assistance is an essential part of the State Department's mission. I would even argue that it is a major part of the security establishment of the United States Government and Customs Service. We must fully fund the Agency, regardless of its allocation, so that our tax dollars are not sent the wrong way and programs are not abruptly terminated when the Agency faces budget and structural deficits.  I would also say that I do not favor a fixed 3.5 percent increase for 1996, as the Senator has proposed. While I have concerns about the need for additional funds, I share his reservations about

Mr. Speaker, as summer turns towards winter, the American people will continue to face high unemployment levels, increasing demand for transportation, and an increasingly complicated Federal highway system.  The highway system will continue to grow in size, as people drive to work and family needs shift to meet business needs and home and community needs. Rita and George Summers of Anchorage, Alaska, would not be shocked to learn that there are large gas prices coming home this winter.  Washington State residents will also be made acutely aware of the impact that the budget resolution the House is considering here today will have on the transportation spending in this country. The House House Republican budget would cut $37.4 billion out of highway spending. Under the House GOP budget, the administration would seek an across-the-board cut of more than $1 billion from every major program.

Now that the worst is over, the Speaker and her Republican colleagues have announced they have no plan to take credit for the economic recovery.  Why are they focused on repeating mistakes of the past? I'm looking at you, Wall Street. ``Sorry guys,'' says the President, ``we're just not tough enough. You'll have to forgive us.''  Mr. Speaker, the American people are smart enough to know we need a real solution.

I, of course, voted for him on an equal footing. But for me, this is an issue of fairness.  As the Presiding Officer knows, there has been some criticism that, in Senator Bumpers' years as a county commissioner, he allowed the size of his coffers to turn into a function rather than as a mirror.

Mr. Speaker, fixing our Nation's crumbling infrastructure to boost the economy and increase transportation safety is one of our most important responsibilities. Yet the President and the Republicans in Congress are rushing to promote infrastructure spending while protecting corporate special interests and environmental protection interest groups who would increase safety in their efforts to create jobs. They have promised to bring millions of Americans to work but instead have promised to take our Nation to economic ruin. This partisan budget attack on public health will continue to put our Nation further behind in addressing this Nation's critical need for economic growth to boost the economy.  In Oregon and across the Nation, families are counting on us to help them put food on the table and stay warm. In light of the President's budget, it is alarming that Republicans are turning their backs on all that we do to create jobs. Our $1 trillion

convention plan degree 

Final sequence: 

I do not believe this degree of success was achieved in the absence of a major restructuring effort, but rather in the face of a change that came to our country when the proposal to move the country to more private sector control was taken up by the House plan at the time in 1993 and 1995 and not in the Senate bill in 1996. We saw the degree of success, and the overwhelming bipartisan support for this movement. In the area of the medical industry, the Senator and I joined the convention in 1978. I think it was an idea that most of us came to support at that time, and it was not possible under present rules. But I have taken the good path in trying to encourage people to believe that change is possible.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I rise to reluctantly oppose the amendment of my colleague. I appreciate what Senator Inhofe has offered and offered here today in a number of other amendments. For years now I have sponsored and supported funding for the Presidio. It is clearly a long way from where we need to be and a short way from where we have been for the last few years and years past where we have been able to fund it well and get it moving to its intended use. Banks and mortgage companies--all of these entities, small and large--find it difficult or impossible to obtain financing on the idea of putting out money to develop a brand-new Federal building in San Diego. I cannot think of any building that is used in America today that could take $1.3 billion in capital investment over 3 years.  Senator In

These have been the needs of this country since World War II and for America and Brazil, Canada and Mexico to say no to the terrorists, the smugglers, and drug traffickers because of the Central American presence on our shores is an act of national security and wrong.

We are not talking about any tax on tobacco; we are talking about a tax on these products.  The tobacco industry is one of the richest corporations in this country. The profits generated by their product have nearly doubled since 2002 to reach $6 billion a year in 2003 alone. They are truly a national treasure. Why then, then would we not have a moratorium on the one tax to protect them from a 21st century onslaught of lawsuits? They are getting a license to be even more irresponsible by spending billions of dollars on legal fees to try to undermine the law which they have been pursuing against us.

These special economic sanctions are intended to punish the Chinese Government for crimes committed against its own citizens, and I strongly believe the Secretary of State must take such actions to aid innocent victims of the Chinese Government's deplorable human rights policies.

Final sequence: 

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 817 introduced by the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] and the bill also authored by the distinguished ranking member of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and National Interest of the Committee on Foreign Affairs which recognizes the United States' commitment to the most successful democracy on the face of the Earth, the Republic of Haiti. The resolution recognizes the congressional authorization granted to the waiver of all points of order and asks for the immediate consideration of the measure.  This resolution expresses the House's support for the sovereignty of the Republic of Haiti and commends the Government of Haiti for exercising its constitutional obligation under article 14 of the Geneva Conventions and the political, administrative, and economic framework established by the charter of the Republic of Haiti.

government president executive 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution gave the executive branch of our Government authority to keep and to protect private property. The government does this by giving the President the authority to take private property and transfer it to another government agency in return for a tax deduction that Congress later has to pay. The executive branch has that authority over the tax deductibility.  I want to quote from a letter from IRS Commissioner McCarran explaining this action: In all respects, the principle of      separation of powers and checks and balances which enabled      the adoption of the U.S. Constitution was a factor in      the adoption of the American Tax Code. Only by applying a      consistent legal and economic regime can a clear      separation of powers guarantee

tax adjust difference

But as the Senator's chart demonstrates, if you adjust that for inflation, what your GDP growth is today in the year 2000 is still less than half of what it is in the year 2000 under this tax plan. This chart clearly shows what this means to the average working American that you would need to have in order to adjust the growth to a point where we would have actually the kind of growth we all need to have going forward if we are to really be able to get our way to a tax reform that we should be able to agree upon that we can all come together in difference. And I believe that is what the American people want, not the kind of spending that continues in excess of a trillion dollars each year.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Final sequence: 

I say to my friend, as I told the Senator in my opening statement, the President has not given me any direction to give me an amendment to try to find some kind of actionable action on the amendment. There may be some time I need to do it in the future. But the fact is that that is not the rules of the Senate. If there are cloture motions filed on the nomination, then it would be possible for the Senate to take up any other pending amendment, vote it up or down, or refer it back to the committee if there are those procedural hurdles there.  But it seems to me that the Senator from Nebraska was simply talking about some kind of emergency. The fact is that the President has not given me any suggestion in any way to suggest to me what I should do.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The so-called May 9 Republican Members of the Senate have not yet taken this opportunity to respond to this result of the same type of legislation we passed just 2 days later on May 9 in the House of Representatives. That kind of a strange thing occurs in the U.S. Senate when it is the other side that has come to the floor and is sea different from what we were in the House of Representatives for any of those 50-plus days that the two Houses had to operate, submarines, standing off to the right, standing off to the left.

This bill will force Congress to change our current health care law and destroy the current program that provides health care for the millions of American citizens who do not have insurance today and the State of Connecticut was never designed to be a service-based program but, as Nancy Pelosi said in her State of the Union Address, she really meant it that way.  She said that if you want health care reform, you have to adopt a balanced approach that reduces the deficit while still providing health care for all Americans.

It is a time when Americans are looking for peace and support for both parties to work out their differences and to find a solution for the problems of people all across this country and that is why it is so important that we come together and support the Social Security Act.  I think we were all reminded today that Mr. Takano talked about workers like his mom who said, you know, ``You can put me on the bench anytime you want Oops.'' So that is why I think this bill is so important. I am proud that I was a cosponsor of the Congress-passed bill.

It has been such an effective force for good that NATO has done more for peace in Europe than any other organization since it was established more than 50 years ago and supported NATO and the European Union over the past half century. NATO remains the world's most important security force and is the United States' closest ally. This treaty also Hungary has a unique stake in. It is a former member of NATO and serves as an ally, along with the Netherlands, with whom Hungary shares a close political, economic, and security relationship.

The milestone that also happens to be on the James River Bridge in Lake Clark County was laid down June 24, 1989, and was not in good graces with the Illinois Department of Transportation. The State of Illinois imposed temporary closure of this bridge due to a mechanical failure, though its alignment at the time would have been hazardous. It was called off when an emergency list of deaths was created and two small, fatality-prone pedestrians were made eligible for the new bridge.

There are some other amendments being offered that would restrict, by law, the ability of the States to set national standards for smokefree workplaces, and there is nothing to stop those two amendments from being pending in this House.  My amendment simply makes it impossible for the Federal Government to interfere in the right to smokefree workplaces. This, of course, strikes me as an abuse of our authority, and I hope that our colleagues will reject this amendment.

So these appropriations are just that. They can be manipulated by the legislative body, and those who say we have to stop Government funding activities which we cannot control are totally out of touch with reality.

Today, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts that defense spending will not rise above the President's fiscal year 2020 request and that additional cuts will be required to achieve any significant decrease in the national debt.  To offset this cost, it is essential for the next Congress to enact meaningful reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs.

transportation senator turn 

Final sequence: 

On Wednesday, following morning business, the Senate will resume the FAA bill and the pending transportation funding bill to be considered later this afternoon. Senator Whitehouse will be the next to offer a motion to refer to the Transportation and Infrastructure bill to try to get the Government back on its feet to get some things done to get our country back to work and to get our economy back to work so that we can turn it around.  I think this is a good day for the Senate. We have had enough fighting. We have been able to get the people back to work, we have been able to put in place the mechanism to get Federal Aviation Administration to make certain it can do the things that it needs to do to solve the problems that we have at this point in time, and it is time to pass this bill.  I yield

moratorium aware signed 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker I am very aware of it, and for that reason it becomes meaningless. I would have to understand that because I think the actions of the other side have been very clearly stated by the fact that we have not asked the moratorium be lifted.  So I must assume that I am not wrong in that situation with regard to what I think I understand to be what is happening here because I understand that we are very aware of it. It is a long day for a lot of people in the South and a very long day for a lot of Members on this side of the agreement signed on the 7th and the 8th to be able to finish this bill, if it is in fact accepted by the body that passed the bill today, the D.C. appropriations bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

effectively main chair 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, I wish to thank the Chair and my colleague from Georgia who understood this clearly when she was chair of the Agriculture Committee and the time was crucial to pass this legislation which is so important for our country and it is so important for the people of the State of Georgia because it will allow us to effectively compete in the global economy that the country needs.  The main thrust of the bill is designed to produce savings through biotechnology and identify the research that is producing solutions that would allow us to have new and innovative technologies that are more able to sustain us in the next century and the next 100 years, and that is critically important to our future.  We also have a huge opportunity in this Congress to provide tax relief to farmers who make a higher income but are still subject to some sort of taxes that keep them from saving

million united friend 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would remind my colleague from North Carolina that he should support this amendment because it will keep the States which currently spend $100 million a year on the National Guard from having to contract for the $300 million the United States spends on the National Guard in the current year. And I think that is a good thing as well because if we want to do that we should do it now because one thing this friend and colleague from North Carolina has said today is that it is not one point that we have to focus on, it is not one issue to concentrate on, it is not one uniform objective to achieve, but is a process that is going to be worked on as it evolves by each State.  The problem with this is that we are not going to do that

Mr. ROYCE. I thank my gentleman for yielding.  I rise to join my distinguished colleague in support of the Morocco Accountability Act. It represents a first step in encouraging the kind of responsible and responsible behavior that we expect from our friends around the world.  I commend the gentleman from Minnesota for sponsoring this legislation, and I'm proud to cosponsor it with Mr. Peters.

I am reminded of a friend of mine, when I was the Secretary of State and she talked to me about what was going on in Bosnia during the last 2 years and asked me if there was anybody I could call on to do something about it that would be more forceful in our State Department and my Secretary of State, Secretary Clinton said, ``The President has asked me to ask President Clinton to send me the Congress.'' She reminded me about a famous portrait of that famous man. They said the Pied Piper to the people of America in this country, George Washington. Here is a picture of President George Washington with more muscle. He would not have felt it.  I find myself somewhat like a Pied Piper with no armor and no knapsack. My good friend from Virginia, who is an Italian war veteran, points

I am talking about the heart and soul of welfare policy; I am not talking about the military issue or the budget issue. I have been president of a public school board here in California, and I have actually adopted a policy where we stopped the welfare of our students at that school for the first time in 50 years when we passed the law of the house of representatives to allow that policy.  We said we did not want to allow a federal amendment to a local ordinance to let these kids stay at school if we thought it was in the best interest of our kids. I think that we should have that same policy for everybody. The people who are having problems, let's not allow them to become a welfare burden for themselves. But if they want to get good jobs and get their education and start a family, they should not
