Who wants terrorists to be able to come across the border and say to Border Patrol, ``Look at this radical Muslim population in your country. You cannot let me in,'' because if they allow them in, they are committing a war crimes violation under combatants' laws? The amendment only allows them to bring in the convicted terrorists that committed acts of war.  The PATRIOT Act should not be subject to campaign-finance restrictions

This was on the recommendation of the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, the Senator from Minnesota.  The action will now be completed.

Mr. Speaker, in Speaker Pelosi's first year in the House of Representatives she began to change the rules in a very important way. Her colleagues on the other side of the aisle are too correct to say that the changes in the House rules would create chaos and stability and balance in the American way of life. They would be dead wrong.  I don't know whether she realizes it or not, but her change from the rules of the House of Representatives to a more closed and closed process called a closed rule is one of the primary ways to get public interest legislation in a Congress where everyone has to stand aside and

Well, if we do not do something about it, I believe we are in danger of setting a bad precedent for this country, a bad precedent which could be repeated on a massive scale. This House should not be allowed to establish a precedent that would lead to a constitutional amendment, and so I have introduced the

How much you think you should be going out each night or do you think you should just keep going until you are doing that little difference between 21 and 50 percent of your day going out with friends and family because it is not in the national interest to be out all night or district work if we are going to have this problem resolved. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

energy rise gentleman

Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Hastings] has this point that the energy tax may not be a cost effective measure because it may increase prices for consumers but it may increase revenues for the government because it increases the demand for energy and increases the price of oil for consumers and increases the rise in the price of gasoline.  Is the gentleman aware of the fact that the single greatest source of interest in the cost of oil in the United States today is energy, the combined consumption of energy and tourism?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

He vetoed it. He vetoed it for the second time. In fact, he vetoed it last time and basically

The American people are tired of hearing half truths. This bill that we are addressing today is a welfare reform proposal that is good for America.  This bill will provide tax relief for hardworking families. It will create jobs for Americans. And in the first year, it will allow families to keep more of what they earn

Madam Chair, this amendment is a third-party threat to Congress from the Government if it does not provide us with a lot of information which has been requested by the States. As a physician who provides health care to more than 130,000 Americans on Medicare and Medicaid that is important information. Commerce would not even be allowed to use the proposed language in its bill if Congress had this amendment, and that is a problem.  Our health care professionals don't need a Federal database if their patients don't have that information. In a time when costs are skyrocketing, we need to find creative solutions.

Mr. President, I was disappointed that the House of Representatives had not passed the State Children's Health Insurance Program extension earlier this week by an overwhelming majority of the American people. In fact, I think the largest single reason the vote was so close was the fact that the Democrats spent over $1 billion more than the Republicans had to spend to help our constituents.  What we should have done a long time ago was to say yes to millions of hardworking Americans who are getting their health insurance without raising taxes.  At the same time, we should take a hard look at how we are going to pay for it

We must complete the work of completing the budget now before adjournment of the 105th Congress.  If we cannot pass a budget, then why should we not pass the defense appropriations bill

In my State of Kansas we have had a real debate on public service as the concept of paying for it or creating something new and authorizing it or regulating it first is something that should be debated amendment to amendment. It is something that should be a decision for the citizens, the citizens of the State and the citizens of the Nation.  It is not because there is no basic need or no current function, but it is that the

Mr. Speaker, what Republicans are doing with regard to the $1 trillion stimulus bill has more to do with Congress and President Obama than the need for any one Democrat to admit he is wrong about the economy or that he needs to reevaluate his leadership positions as he is well aware.  Republicans want to invest money into the private sector to provide for people who have been victims of charities, employers, and banks that need rescuing. As a small business owner, I do not want any government's bailout. I think we need to establish the incentives to create jobs that will produce results and leave businesses with money to invest

As many of us know, a capital gains tax cut is simply one of the most effective ways to help our economy grow. Small businesses provide much of the wealth that the American people produce, and the economy is built upon

But as the American people have seen in recent days, how we should handle our responsibilities in our public realm and who is to blame for the inability of a few individuals to determine priorities as we look at balancing the Federal budget is very important.  Americans know that public servants make a difference for our society and our nation--those individuals who take the time to do the most important and necessary work of government have not been forgotten. So today, with all due respect to those individuals who provide public service

Iraqis are increasingly diverging from the rhetoric of George W. Bush's war on terror as Iraqi families continue to flee Iraq for safe havens abroad. We face threats everywhere that emanate from Koran burning terrorists to Islamist terrorists seeking to destroy Western civilization from within.

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, the chairman of the committee had spoken of the fact that the bill was inches away from reaching the $700 million mark and was 10 days away from the floor. And yet all that time Thomas went and talked to the Members on the other side of the aisle and pawed through their backpacks and their lunch boxes and brightness, trying to find any reason they were not satisfied. I want to just make a couple of comments to that issue.  Mr. Chairman, it was not hard for me to see why.

Why does this matter? Because one of the ways we approach spending increases is through tax increases. In 1987, Congress passed the

Those in Congress who are not as interested in balancing the budget and enacting legislation that would not reduce spending bills and lower taxes are perhaps more interested in raising taxes. In this way they would be making their argument, while their constituents are paying the price for that position.  We could spend more money than we bring in by cutting taxes in the United States.

Mr. Speaker, in 1991 and 1992, our Tax Code included the Consumer Price Index and Small Business Act provisions that were designed to help small businesses with their taxes and help them obtain that technology. Unfortunately, the tax code was drafted very heavily by a Democrat leadership, and it has been an abysmal failure as far as the tax provisions are concerned. Also I advocate supporter legislation that many of the small businesses that are being battered by unemployment and of course all the people losing their jobs are the people that manufacture these items for small businesses.

I just think it is very important we continue in this debate and speaker after speaker has come here to the floor and said what we need to do in Iraq and what we need to do in Afghanistan in order to continue lives on that ground.  Mr. Speaker, we need to do both. We need to make sure that fatalities in Afghanistan are reduced and we need to make sure that ISIL has a lesson to learn on that part of the world.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, I rise in support of the Dole-Castle substitute to the President's budget for fiscal year 1997 and the budget he put together last year for the next year and a half as the work of the President to the hardworking men and women of our States, especially my State of Kansas.  After President Clinton dropped the budget he put together in last year's session, it was absolutely necessary for us to once again come to grips with this difficult budget process and its consequences. It is my sense that the budget that he has put together is clearly a step in the right direction, and indeed

I can only say that I think the minutes of this debate prove that the American people strongly support this very important legislation.  As one of the few Members of Congress who does not happen to represent any of the small business ventures in my State, I feel that the practical issues of which we are debating need

Mr. President, I want to say a few words on this bill before we begin this week's session of the Senate and the upcoming election year. For too long, in American life and this country as well, the status quo of the way women are treated--the status quo of the way Americans do business and the way the government and the Federal Government is concerned about the way we meet our delegation obligations. This is a subject that some have championed, and I do not think anyone who is a practicing physician, is critical of that. But I think this particular bill is something we should all be focused on.

Mr. Chairman, this is the same measure that the House has been trying to get through this Congress for some time now to get rid of the estate tax and make it much less expensive to give money to our seniors. Now the bill that the other side has offered would make it much more expensive to give money to our seniors if we do not benefit from estate tax relief for estate planning assets for property owners. It is a full-blown conspiracy to take away any tax relief that our seniors might get as a result of this measure.  This also gives the illusion that this measure is going to cost no money at

Madam President, the year 1997 will be the 20th year that the price of gasoline has gone up for the Senate Government program.

While I strongly believe we ought to take steps to increase fuel economy standards for automobiles, it is impossible to keep up with any small incremental improvement in vehicle fuel economy when the dollar price of gas goes up. That is why I am introducing legislation to give every American with an automobile an incentive to purchase a home equipped with all-wheel drive.  For

The jobless numbers are in, and Americans should be seeing more jobs being created, not more cuts or amendments or suspensions of our deficit-cutting responsibilities. That is the purpose of the motion to recommit on Social Security and Medicare.  H.R. 6 has been ruled a ``waiting list'' gimmick. But what it really is is a closed-door con job to try to raise the cost of Social Security and Medicare while it talks a good game.  All we are doing is limiting Medicare and Medicaid cuts. There is no way to keep that promise.

Mr. Speaker, just this month, the Clinton administration said Federal spending for Medicare would rise in fiscal year 1996 by $10 billion to $36 billion and tax relief for the wealthy would be the same amount as for the next 7 years. In other words Republican budget economists predict that Federal spending will grow by only 1.7 percent over the next 7 years, if the President's proposals are to be enacted.  We should not ask the American people to choose between two visions of the future.

The Chairman of the Committee wishes to make a few comments as to why he is asking that we fully fund this bill before the end of the year.  As a result of the Christmas holiday and the families back home, we have seen an enormous rise in our debt over the last several months

In its budget report, the Senate clearly stated that the Republicans' health care plan would ``provide stronger, better quality health care for seniors, children, and families.'' My constituents and I support this vital proposal because it reduces costs for our seniors, and improves the quality of care for our children.

But when you have listened to the difference, Republicans in Congress have been consistent.

If you think this is an acceptable role for the Federal Government to play, this vote shows you how many Senators disagree.  Sixty-three Senators and 14 Republicans have written to the Finance Committee to urge passage of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act

Over the past decade, the prevalence of student violence and delinquency has continued to increase in our country. Juvenile delinquency has remained at levels that the national average is experiencing. While increasing arrests of youth violence in some States are important to develop new strategies, the State action measures are simply not enough to close the youth

Congressman Gibson played a pivotal role in leading Foxboro to become one of the nation's top financial centers. He was the chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee and served as the chairman of the Suffolk County Democratic Committee.

Mr. Speaker, I think this is something that should have been worked out years ago by the health care bill. Now it seems that we are in the process of trying to accomplish something different.  Unfortunately, the new proposal to solve Medicare Advantage costs are not as easily characterized as we would like. If you look at the budget presented by the President, we still have a massive increase in Medicare costs. In fact, the President's budget proposes to increase Medicare costs by $7,000 per recipient. In comparison, the budget proposal of House Speaker Hastert to control costs is $2,500 per recipient

This does not mean that there is not some kind of need that could come from that fact that we have no doubt that if we had increased its funding to $50 million, that the facilities might be in need of it.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Shuster]. As the nation recognizes the importance of promoting individual responsibility and personal responsibility over Federal regulation of insurance products, Congress should be offering proposals to support the protection of private sector insurance policies and practices. We should not be attempting to limit industry activities which Agriculture and insurance companies have ably pursued.  More than 20 States have enacted restrictions on the interstate sale of insurance products, and Congress should work with the States in developing the necessary policies for protecting consumers.

We will be here the majority of the time this year, and it will provide us a fair opportunity to debate the issues and the legislation before us in a way we have not had in almost 30 years.  But

I would just say that when it comes to an issue of this magnitude as what we just saw we have the floor of this House and we have people coming out from the other side of the Capitol saying it is not happening in this body. And that is the issue here because what this bill does is it has an idea proposal, an effort to raise the question of how we use taxpayer dollars.  And my amendment does not prevent any funding from going to this, but the idea of this amendment is to make the argument that we do have some

Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi and her leadership continue to drag their feet on legislation that will benefit and protect our American taxpayers and protect this Nation from those who would do us harm. As my colleagues know, Congress needs stimulus money. Members of Congress need help with the economic outlook.  This is very, very, very important, and so I am extremely encouraged by the Majority Leader's recent statement that she is going to pass this bill on a voice vote. Unfortunately, the majority leader has found it necessary to delay all votes in an effort to reach a Democratic agreement on a short-term extension of unemployment benefits.

Mr. President, before I address the Senator from Georgia again for some debate, it would be good for this Senate to take a look at the vote we had a few days ago on filibuster rules when we finally did defeat that continuing resolution. There is an increasing disenchantment with the filibuster which has been demonstrated over the years. For a number of years now, as many Members on both sides of the aisle have observed and said, the filibuster has been very ineffective in resolving important issues, and I think a lot of that dissatisfaction stems from the fact that we have had some of the same Members, then very

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill to expand the exchange of prescription drug benefit benefits with Medicare for the elderly and improve and strengthen the Medicare Administration prescription drug plan which has been a bipartisan issue for more than a decade. This bill passed overwhelmingly on bipartisan Senate and House floor earlier this year and has been a top priority for this Congress for the last 7 months.  Over 7 years ago Congressman Hunter, then ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means, introduced a bill to expand the expansion of the Medicare drug benefit to more senior citizens. It was in this area of concerns that, in

The wisdom of the decision will certainly be remembered by the American people for years to come.

Mr. Speaker, this morning on television stations across the country, we heard from some of the former directors of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. These men outlined in detail what has been going on behind the scenes at the end of the cold war and the beginning of the new century. Many of us have noted the massive increases in national expenditures that we have seen since the end of the cold war. These costs now outstrip the national budget. This

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Bill ``Jim'' Fairchild who passed away earlier this month. Bill served the great State of West Virginia as a chairman of the West Virginia Red Cross from 1988 to 1989 and was the Golden Eagle of the Red Cross' First District, western North Carolina.  Jim was also an accomplished musician, who served in the Greenbrier Battlefield Music Center band for several years. Mr. Speaker, I offer my condolences to his family and friends. I am sad he will never return home.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The legislation before us today reduces the Federal support for local school districts by $25 million. As an original cosponsor of the bill, I am concerned that, as the picture here shows, local districts are still able to control their own educational costs,

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his amendment and for the kind remarks he made on this topic. But I wanted to take a moment to make a couple of points that the bill would not change abortion in the bill as written, which means that any time that an individual wants to terminate a pregnancy as Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has pointed out, there would be no restriction as to how they do it.  So this amendment does not preclude any abortions necessarily in accordance with ObamaCare mandates obligated under the legislation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
