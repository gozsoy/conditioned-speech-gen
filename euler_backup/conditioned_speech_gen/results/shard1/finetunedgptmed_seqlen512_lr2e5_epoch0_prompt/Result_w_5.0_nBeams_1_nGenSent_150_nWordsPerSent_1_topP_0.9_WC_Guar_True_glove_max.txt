Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states that the funds made available to the State to carry out activities to provide adequate and efficient improvements to our Nation's water and wastewater systems will be made available only to States that make significant commitments and implement major initiatives such as underground storage and greater public transparency and information sharing in environmental standards and regulations and other environmental criteria included in the report submitted to Congress by the EPA within the regulatory parameters contained in the legislation. This is the same language used in H.R. 1845 which would create the elements of the National Environmental Policy Act, a mandatory set of regulations required under this bill to be ``completed, issued, and promulgated'' within a year, but the bill also states that funds will be available only to States that fulfill the full requirement for independent

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I think is an issue that is very important in the Senate and what we are doing here on this floor today and why I think that amendment is going to do real and positive things to try to get that legislation done and get the tax credits made permanent that are going to be required to help families that have children with special needs that should not have to have those children forced to be child care abuse victims.  This amendment goes a long way toward helping the majority in this body to do that and it will not cost the Senate. This amendment will create jobs. It will go a long way to helping this country get our economy back on its feet. And if that is not enough, it will, frankly, send the message that we need to get this

I agree that osteoporosis should be the focus of aggressive detection, prevention and treatment activities. I would also note that the NIH did not name oste osteoporosis the first disease to be studied in the United States.

Many of us remember the difficult era that followed World War II when no one knew why some Americans would have what they know to be uncommon pain or feeling, what owe is simply invisible, what, indeed, has been the cause of the varying reactions to the sun.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I am the original cosponsor of Senator Gramm's amendment, which will significantly increase the loan program by $750 million in two consecutive years.  The amendment simply increases the amount of each loan of approximately $700. Small businesses have every incentive to invest in and grow their businesses. However, one of the biggest impediments to this growth is Federal Government intervention. Even though small businesses have the flexibility to borrow, they

This Monday is the 71st anniversary of the founding of the state of Florida, and one of the major events of the month is at 12:00 p.m. on that day on the Constitution Walk and the Republican reenactment of the story of the Revolution and the Declaration of Independence.

Mr. President, the balanced budget amendment is necessary to limit the Federal Government's power to take away people's money and put it in the pockets of America's families. Our economy is struggling because we need a strong economy to grow our economy and create jobs. Economic growth would be enough to help create jobs in this country. If we were to pass a balanced budget amendment, we would save taxpayers nearly $2 trillion in the next 7 years. We would also continue to create the jobs that will create the families that will take care of our children and grandchildren.  Americans need a strong and stable economy. This amendment will give a boost to the economy, while lowering taxes and spending. If we want to continue to grow the economy, we have to change the way we live our lives. We need to get our economy growing. It's

Abortion should be the last procedure practiced in this country that is permitted in this country. The ban on safe and legal abortions has contributed to what is not only a societal trend toward declining access to contraception, but also into a culture that discourages women from exercising their reproductive freedom.

If I may say, there are a lot of debates that take place on the floor of the United States Senate these days about whether we ought to have a national plan for how we should deal with the problems we have in this country today because of this issue, but the simple fact is the President of the United States has a clear idea and has given us the direction that we ought to go with regard to how we are going to deal with these issues and the nature of the problem we have here. And this resolution is one of the best measures that the President has come up with, a very, very strong declaration on this issue that says that the United States is willing to come to the table and we are willing to work with the other countries of the world to get something done on behalf of people in this country, that we

But in the interest of passing a good tax relief bill and saving the people trapped in debt, I object to the amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to expand upon some of my prior comments that I made during our debate on the fiscal year 2006 Defense appropriations bill last week. In September 1994, I voted to table the Defense appropriations bill for 1995 due to the following issues on October 14 September 1994 which may only be resolved in February 1995 following a September 4 April 1995 conference committee meeting in Washington.  As the Senate passed the defense authorization bill for the first time on October 4 of that year Congress set the date of the panel that would be selected to continue the work that had already been completed during previous months.  Unfortunately, while Augustine Air Force Base was set as the probable location for the conference committee, the September 4th conference committee meeting was canceled the very next day, October 14. This is a total lack of foresight

Mr. President, it is easy to see why earmarking is held so dear to so many in this body and in the country. In this last year we have had over 100 in our committee over $40 million in earmarks to our dear friend and senior Senator from California for the very same purpose he is using in the case at hand here today.  In fact in the last two days a different Senator has held hearings, twice. One of those hearings was on earmarks and another on trying to get a hold on this committee. That is the problem.  All of us feel, if we had only a commonsense bill, that we could save about $400 million from our budget. The more money we save, the more taxpayer dollars we save.

Second, my friends on the other side of the aisle have suggested in this debate that the single biggest barrier to our nation's success in modernizing our immigration laws is the immigration system itself. That is what they have said and have put forward in this debate.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Inhofe to establish the Oklahoma City Commission on Aviation Safety. We will be calling this bill the OnGOA Aviation Safety Act because this is the first time that this committee has had this opportunity to do so today. This legislation will set up a commission to increase the number of Federal workers in the aviation industry and increase the number of dedicated domestic air marshall forces in the United States. This rise in the number of dedicated domestic air marshall forces is long overdue and is an opportunity to increase the aviation safety of the United States for park visitors, in general.  In the 103d Congress, this Congress enacted aviation safety legislation to increase the number of dedicated air marshal forces in the United States. That legislation required the Aviation Security Administration to increase the number of dedicated marshall force

Mr. President, I have another matter on which I wish to speak, but I want to do it on the floor of the Senate rather than as a matter of privilege for a moment so I can come to the floor after some time has passed so we can get it done this evening so we can have a vote just about as soon as possible on this program that I have the privilege of having before the Senate. The question is this. In a few years time we have this in place that if we could just have a vote on the so-called once last year ago an initial vote, you would have a vote immediately on this bill, but we can have a vote every 5 years; or there can be a period of time in which we do this, with perhaps a moratorium in the beginning.

I first came to Congress and came here with a solid understanding of the legislative process, first of all, how the Constitution really worked, and now to have to worry about any of that is inexcusable.  It is unfortunate that the bill before us will have the most drastic effect on the people who put all of our products and people's lives at risk every single day, so I applaud and thank you.

It is really quite simply not so much something that we are doing that we have done wrong but something that we do things that we should and we should not be doing.  Now, we have some procedural problems we need to get to for the rest of the week. We have some standing committees, and there are a lot of riders in that bill.

Mr. President, today for the second week in a row the Senate Judiciary Committee's agenda passed with strong bipartisan support. Today marks another milestone in Senate Republicans' effort to advance legislation that will reform the way we conduct Congressional investigations of the Attorney General. It is an amendment to be offered by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Moran. It is also an example of what I think of as Senator Snowe's 40-minute law on the budget, which has so successfully been passed in the Senate.  Under this amendment, Senator Moran would have the authority to exclude certain kinds of taxpayer dollars from Congress' spending decisions. If the Senator from Kentucky ever finds out that Congress appropriated millions of dollars to reimburse State officials for charges against a man, and the House of Representatives appropriated a lot of money to reimburse that person for these charges, the

And we are not involved in any compensation which would be appropriate here because we do not pay the poll taxes, as some people like to say, for what they do in the 10 years that it takes for us to be able to pay them.

It is certainly a shame that House Speaker Ryan and other members of this body did not do the right thing by the American people. There should be no hiding from it. We must make it clear that they will not get a straight answer when they say that these seven judicial nominees should never be confirmed and will not be confirmed unless the Republican majority is willing to change their beliefs and stop this poison and abuse of power that they have brought about in our government.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

beneficiary bankrupt house 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, 2 years ago, the Medicare trustees--three of whom are members of the President's Cabinet and one of whom is a Senator--sent a document to Congress that called on Congress to change the Medicare beneficiary payment system by asking Congress to spend $500 million over the next 5 years to address the payment problems that Medicare currently faces with the current use of the Hospital Payment and The Outpatient Office Tax that we all bankrupt Americans on a regular basis now. So the President now is going to put in place the Senate bill for the House conference report.  The hospital payment system currently makes out-of-pocket payments to each beneficiary in a limited fashion to pay for services and equipment. If Medicare is going to change, then we are going to have to change this system. This current system is not working.  That is why I am happy

Mr. President, as the Republican leadership gavels this session to a close, I am disappointed by the lack of progress on several of the major issues that have united us in the House and now united us in the United States Senate to act on for the American people and to find ways to bring about the fundamental change in how America does business and how America treats its workers and how America treats the future of the United States. We all agree the regulatory state is broken, it is out of control and, as the Democratic leadership has admitted, Washington's abysmal performance in doing its job is responsible for much of that.  Unfortunately, that was not apparent to all who were watching last night's debate. No one who was paying attention saw us with enthusiasm in our effort to close off that $100 billion-plus pipeline to oil. There

Unfortunately, there are still many tough choices left to make that still cannot get done so we may finally make a budget that not only funds the government but also results in real results for the American people when the next election has come to an end and they finally have a chance to put their failed policies to the rest.  We should all agree that it is wrong to ignore our security threats in our inner cities and bygone boondoggles and to hide behind empty rhetoric that the passage of the budget will somehow undermine national security. It is time to lay out a coherent and predictable path forward. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the government will be operating a surplus of $18 billion in fiscal year 1997,

When we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act some 40 years ago, it clearly stated that Americans should be able to benefit from the paid sick leave that they take for any reason they choose to receive such benefit. Individuals are now going to take one day off for every 4 weeks they are at work because they feel they have to take this time off to get sick, sick people need hungry leave, and Congress should stop this job killing cycle.  Farmers across America have said publicly and privately that this is not the right approach. We have heard directly from the growers and the small business owners throughout the Nation.

Securing and preventing the spread of information does not begin and end with securing our information systems. Any time information is leaked or stolen it negatively impacts the information that flows into and out of government systems. Over the years, the private sector has raised $5 billion through an initiative known as ``GO to School'' to acquire some of the most efficient and effective systems for securing and protecting their data

So this would take effect immediately and any Army aircraft would be retired as a military asset by this process. We have already found all of these cost savings, including two of the three major items, the pilot radars, at these cost savings that Senator McConnell alluded to.

Now I will say that Reagan, this was the first time in a long time that we had a Democratic President who came to an election and won.

This week, the legislative process has run its course and a schedule for Monday is expected to be announced shortly.  Although we have had some productive weeks during the 105th Congress, we have some unfinished business this year as well. Yesterday, we considered a substitute yielding 395 votes to just 25 votes for the measure.  The purpose of the substitute, Mr. Speaker, was to try to address the issues facing our troops. In doing so, the substitute adopted several provisions that I supported and which would further reduce the burdens that military personnel are putting on our military and its families.

Well, actually, we already gave them an opportunity to see what the costs would be for this law, and it turns out the real costs are real.  Our estimate says that this bill would cause that small business growth rate for 1 year to drop by 23 percent. We know that when they increase their employees, their payrolls decrease. They need to go out and get another year's worth of payroll.  The fact of the matter is, because this bill affects all Americans, because we are talking about 50 million people

Mr. President, let us say it again: Anyone even remotely familiar with the U.S. Constitution would know that Congress can do anything it wants to on the budget, spend it as it wants, and the President of the United States can do what the Congress says he can do.  No, apparently the courts don't believe it, the other body doesn't believe it, and the American people don't believe it. This week, a 6-judge panel overturned the President's budget, banning that discretionary spending that can pay for programs that help American citizens, the middle class, and the military.  As a part of President Clinton's budget, in addition to shortchanging our troops, this budget also underfunds our veterans, jeopardizes our infrastructure, and fundamentally slows our economy. It is simply irresponsible, and it is unconstitutional.

recovery federal kill 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve Board is meeting to consider yet another hike in interest rates that will destroy jobs and steal from working families across this country. Congress must act immediately to kill the Federal Reserve rate increase and save the middle class.  In our current economy and weak economy recovery, millions of families are struggling to find jobs and that is hurting our economy. This puts all of our needs before the whims of Congress, all the middle class.  I am proud to join my colleagues in calling on Congress to bring the Fed rate increase to a vote.  We can live without taxpayer-backed bailouts that will put our economy in a false economy. We can live without unfair giveaways to financial institutions. We can live without Government bailouts that go to Wall Street and other special interests. We can live without Government subsidies that allow

Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for joining us today in support of this bill to reform and reform our education system.  As the special education law is commonly known, it is a program that allows educators to pay for a child's education up to what the State might have spent on education itself to provide that child with a quality education for the rest of their life. Texas, of course, has suffered a disproportionately high rate of AFDC and inadequate funding in the special education law, which means that some children of families that have been in the school system for many, many years and who have fallen behind in their education find themselves in deep poverty as a result.  The bill we are voting on today is a culmination of what I want to call this initiative

fund saving funding

Mr. Speaker, under the guise of saving Medicare, the majority would make funding cuts that increase health care costs for seniors and for Americans at the cost of saving money for the insurance companies. The majority would cut funding to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to the tune of $100 billion in tax dollars. To further increase spending for insurance companies and raise costs for the budget, funding to the Bureau of the Census to establish age- and sex-specific public health guides to meet population needs would be reduced by 50 percent.  Medicare costs have grown from $6.5 trillion in 1960 to $10 trillion in 2000. Today, American seniors pay twice as much for their health care than their parents' did. The so-called savings of the so-called Affordable Care Act have been poorly managed. Many of the ``cost saving''

But that is not even close to the truth. Republicans who support the Clinton plan have been very clear that they are not in favor of the tax cut plan which we are about to vote on today. Even though they have said they are flatly opposed to the tax cut plan, they are actually prepared to vote against the bill itself.  On February 4, 1995, Paul Clement, President Clinton's head of the General Accounting Office, provided a letter to the New York Times announcing that the Clinton administration is considering ``partial repeal of the highest income tax rates in American history.''

ObamaCare was considered a disaster. It undermined millions of Americans' ability to be well-insured and forced Americans into expensive private insurance companies. Instead of being fiscally responsible, the administration has tried to ram the biggest tax increase in our Nation's history through the courts and today is proposing legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

Mr. Speaker, as I watched yesterday's Senate investigations subcommittee hearing, I was disappointed to discover that those involved have looked into nothing more than what may have been in this country illegally for a decade and some who have had the responsibility to handle these people and who are being asked not to do so because they are concerned about what could happen to those who tried and watched their actions. It is an absolute shame that we are talking about now these people and their families who are walking out and may well be charged with additional crimes.  I will be submitting a point of order that the gentlewoman from California is trying to kill. In fact, I would ask that our Democratic colleagues and the American people know that we are going to vote yes. Vote for it. Vote on this thing, and then let's find out what is in it so we

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I want commend the distinguished Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] for bringing this issue to the Senate and for bringing the tax cuts with the budget resolution forward in the committee. We think that the Senator from New Jersey would have been right. Mr. President, I wish to add an additional remark. There are two separate statements by the leaders. They both made statements which emphasize fiscal responsibility. The leadership has been under the misconception that we are going to back the President on spending by a very large amount. In fact, Senator Daschle and I are saying to my colleagues, as well as to my Republican friends, that we are going to balance the budget in 7 years. So the whole point, as the Senator from New Jersey said, is not to take the taxpayers money, it is to balance the budget.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a very special and personally meaningful victory for residents of northwest Ohio. Just before Christmas in 1984, local businessman and city councilman Herman James Willson came to Akron to celebrate the last of his employees, Jim Parkes, who was retiring after 40 years in the city's department of parks. While Jim Parkes worked for West County Supervisor Jim Laney, Jim Willson had moved to Akron because West County officials planned a park in downtown Akron, where downtown residents loved West County parks, parks in Riverside, Warren, and Piqua and an adjoining lakeshore area. Jim Parkes found a location in Rose Forest Park for his 5-acre spot, naming it Jim Parkes Park because of the rural spirit he experienced while working for Robert H. Ford of Toledo, Michigan, as a

The Violence Against Women Act has been a priority of this Congress for many years in Washington and around the country. It was introduced by our previous colleagues, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Fields], the former majority leader and the majority whip, and I think in many instances brought the abuse and violence and domestic violence that was happening in this country to the fore.  It is essential that we pass this bill, but it must be fiscally responsible. There are a few provisions included in this bill that are directly responsible for the reality of the violence that exists in the United States today. The Violence Against Women Act currently allows

Both of these individuals were on the so-called watch list. They did not have to be on the so-called watch list when they came to Tennessee to do that. It is absolutely clear and it is also in the Congressional Record that there is the election of Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Dole.

This legislation is named the Tribal Energy Infrastructure Act of 2005 and is also a companion to the Paul D. Isakson Native American Land Use and Equity Act and has already received critical support from Senators Collins and Murray of Tennessee and Senator Baucus of Montana. This legislation would place a requirement on all major energy companies that they provide certain key reservation information and that they abide by any international energy agreements they enter into that would guarantee that the native people of that area have access to vital resources.

I think that this is an important project that should be allowed to go forward. I just do not think this is the way to proceed.

The President won't be able to protect Chile from this challenge, and therefore we will have to face it head on.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. S. 2004, which passed the House in May and the Senate in November of last year will amend the Indian education law to permit institutions of higher learning the flexibility they need to ensure students with disabilities have an equal opportunity to succeed in education. The provision will permit waiver for the exemption of Indian education facilities from the requirements for adequate student support that are contained in the McKinney-Vento Education Act and Congress has given the Secretary the authority to implement this provision on a case-by-case basis when Speaker Gingrich and the House Republicans refuse to allow a full committee-reported education bill to get out of the committee.  This law, which is the result of decades of effort in education policy and policy consultation, has played a key role in promoting academic excellence and the development of gifted

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, the 1996 welfare reform bill expired about a year ago, and since then the Senate has passed bipartisan legislation to reauthorize this bill for another 6 years. However, Republicans have blocked that legislation from coming to the floor for debate because they claim that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker Pelosi are too weak to face the subject. This is pure madness.  We have a choice between continuing to honor the promises we made in 1996 to the American people and the Republican leadership's current agenda. The American people expect more from Congress and the Republican majority. It is time for Democrats to stand up for the hardworking taxpayers who are fed up with Republicans holding the purse strings tight.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

America will soon come home from Afghanistan and Iraq as we have done since September 11, 2001, America has provided military personnel, and we will continue that on a weekly basis to bring the fight to the Taliban and the al-Qaida terrorists.  My State of Tennessee has returned nearly 600 soldiers to Iraq, and I am proud to say that we have taken a close look at the rationale behind the American presence in Afghanistan.  President Bush's record is a farce. After 9/11 and a fall to dictators like al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, and Hussein, President Bush turned his back on our soldiers and made his peace with them, sometimes doing things like trying to sell Afghanistan to the Taliban.

It is this lack of attention that our allies around the world are looking to us for as they weather hurricane Katrina.  They do not understand that Saddam Hussein and his regime was not a threat to our interests and our national security. Our most important allies are in fact buying our rhetoric about Iraq as if it were going to be easy.  In one respect, Mr. President, this Republican Congress is right.

When the Department of Veterans Affairs first came into existence in the early 1970's, it was expected that the average American veteran would live only 5 years of his or her lifetime in the statistics and at the very least make the monthly cost of paying for VA medical benefits a half a million dollars. Unfortunately, with the benefit of hindsight, this is not the case. These figures have risen to 16 to 18 years in the average life span of this population.  As Congress continues to move forward on

The motion is a rather simple one and I wish to commend the committee for bringing it to this floor in a more effective way than it did last year. It will increase $10 million for education-related research, and would assure the Congress' support for American schools.  As we have seen, when deficit spending and spending on research exceeds outlays, the burden of that burden is placed on States and local governments and communities.  Today's motion preserves the $10 million amount that has been earned from a 2002 initiative of the Federal Government. In 2001, the Gingrich-Stanton resolution provided $12 million to the Education and the Workforce Commission, a bipartisan proposal to modernize the funding structure

In my 20 years in Congress, I have never heard a congressional rule that I consider routine in time and detail written so that the rule is not for the legislative use of Congress. But this rule does not have the required longevity of about 6 months and, since it is not a regular rule, has the full force and effect of congressional law in crafting the specific requirements that each agency and every agency agency agency submits for this rulemaking process.  Because it is an agency rulemaking process rule that has to be agreed to and approved by two-thirds of the agency--on behalf of each agency--I find it the least rules-oriented regulatory process.

The tax cuts have increased the financial security for millions of working families who worked hard and today pay taxes on their paychecks. But these tax cuts have not balanced the budget.  But let us also look at what we have not had. We have not done anything about those two things. We have not even passed a budget that actually would bring in a balanced budget. We are here today because Republicans have tried to tamper with our budget. We have

And I certainly look forward to getting more balanced budget legislation out of the Congress next year.  We have had a number of developments over the last year, including a statement by the American Chamber of Commerce saying that it will oppose this bill for economic reasons.

Why did we have a lot of scores and scores and scores of different proposals that we never got the chance to see? If it was in the Budget Committee, why did they not talk about them?

First of all, missile defense is crucial to our national security and the international peace and security. It is a national security threat, and it is a risk.

However, this legislation represents the only chance to address a serious issue: The immigration of senior citizens and legal immigrants.  With respect to the immigration of legal immigrants, it is important to understand the implications of the legislation that is before us. Senators Craig and Gillibrand are fighting to force employers to pay the same legal immigrant visa taxes as legal immigrants. These provisions will take away any incentive to go through the mandatory background checks that employers already have.  Many employers will be forced to hire legal immigrants simply because they have legal or lawful status--like immigrants who are ``essential'' to their family's continued

Taxpayers will benefit in the long run from projects that will cut funding for those that do not generate revenues and add cost to this country that would otherwise benefit taxpayers in this trillion dollar dollar budget.  By having these savings, these incentives, in place, we can also make the question over funding this year more ``Where did the money go to come from, so it doesn't stay here in Washington?'' Now, while this may seem a little noble, it is extremely wasteful when you consider the scope of a dollar bill.

Mr. President, at the end of May, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a consortium of American labor unions launched a program that would allow employers in this country to petition for immigrant employment visas under the auspices of the Asian and Pacific American Employment Improvement Program.  This program should not be confused with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) which has--to date--actually abused this program, which was created by Congress to help people from countries not commonly believed to be eligible to apply for naturalization.  As a result, for many of our closest neighbors to this south Asian country, the INS has created a procedure, usually without effective controls, which makes it far more likely that people who have obtained U.S. work visa applications will stay in this country after they have been here for a longer period.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Health Care Week. Access to affordable health care access is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Despite the march of progress in the last half of the last century, so much of the progress has come in the last 20 years that so few Americans have the health care they need today to get ahead in the last week and a half of the year.  I want to address today in a personal way why I have chosen this week to take the floor to talk about health care, and one of the reasons why I chose to do that is that just last week I had the honor to travel to Nairobi to meet with many of the leaders and citizens of Kenya. As a country, we have a particular love for the people of Kenya and their unparalleled health care system. As

Mr. Speaker, tonight at about 9 p.m. we are going to begin consideration of the Defense Authorization Act of 2008 and I want to take this opportunity to talk about the important issue of funding for the Nation's homeland security program in this resolution we are considering tonight. It is a resolution that we support because of the United States Government's success in the war on terror and it is our good work here that we are going to continue this fight for us today that will keep our country safe when we should not be told to go on.  Mr. Speaker, the homeland security funding for this bill is a chance to show the Congress that our country is ready and willing to make sure that it is both a homeland and a Federal asset, and that we are going to continue to invest our national resources in a manner that is always thoughtful and flexible

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I share the gentleman's legitimate concern for the condition of BIA roads, but if that is the only mechanism available to fix a crumbling road system which is now in maintenance mode, then I will agree that the bill does not provide adequate legislation on this issue to deal with the issue of safety and the needs of EPA in our ``safety first'' transportation policy.  That amendment, which I know the gentleman is seeking, will allow H.R. 6268 to proceed on its more comprehensive spending-management legislation that would address this problem of BIA road repair.

This bill includes important provisions to strengthen homeland security programs and continue to increase the share of Federal funds allocated to the agency's Intelligence and Analysis Division yield their leading edge research and development efforts.  We should not underestimate the dangers of terrorism. Unfortunately, too many of our efforts are being directed at the effects of domestic unrest and other issues.

The law created this fund in 2002 to provide to States the information they need in order to plan and execute the security operations and tactical equipment available at the III borders. The aid will fund as well as serve the needs of DHS for increased border control, forward border security, cross-border border liaison, counterdrug efforts, electronic identification, digital address verification, and similar activities.

New Mexico is one of the States that has the House and Senate split equally, and the State is dependent on the legislature for their budget.  During the 1990s, we were hurt by the 1986 and 1992 budgets and saw our deficit and our $5.8 billion deficit balloon. We all know that $10 billion did not prevent us from being back on the track for balanced budgets in 1999.  Last Congress, we allowed the legislature to raise the estate tax. This comes up with a $400 exemption on estates. We also created the 45 percent reduction rate, limiting the size of estates tax based on incomes.  This

This was a great idea by the President in 2001 and it is a great idea by the conferees in fact today when the motion to instruct is offered. This is very simple. The tax provisions we had in the tax package that the House offered to us in 2001 will expire. Let us extend these tax benefits for people who make capital gains or dividends for the next 6 months. So in other words, people who pay all their income tax now and put money into investing, that money will be available for them in the future.

Let us take a look at one urban area that has an interesting, creative use of that surplus. That area is the city of Harrisburg in Pennsylvania where there are some of the poorest people in the country in northwestern Pennsylvania, in southwestern Pennsylvania.  So I ask my colleagues to take a look at the money that was wasted in that area when, under the leadership of Governor Wolf and Republican Governor Hutchison, the House passed a budget that would cut Federal Government by $7 billion.

The American people understand these problems and want the House Republicans to address them, as they do with Social Security and Medicare.

School District 1140 was created by Alabama Congress in 1950.  In 1953, Congress enacted legislation to make it more difficult for schools to close without too great a controversy. At the time, it was thought that it was a good idea, but other schools decided they needed better funding and they could pass more legislation to take control of these schools.

This program also allows FEMA to set the priorities for helping rebuild and restore public infrastructure in a disaster area by providing direct funding to priority transportation, water, electric transmission, wastewater, infrastructure maintenance projects, and wastewater systems construction projects utilizing Federal disaster monies.  FEMA will follow specific guidelines set out in the program and will follow the established definition of a disaster to prioritize resources. FEMA is involved in defining the amount of funding for each of these activities, but it provides flexibility in the prioritization of funds, where necessary to meet the needs of any affected communities.  One area of concern I have is the concept of State and local authorization for the funds allocated for the

Mr. President, back in 1985, I was a second-term Member of the House of Representatives in Vermont. I was elected in the Republican Party to serve the people of Vermont and the country of Vermont as a Member of the Democratic Congress. Senator Sanders represents the same vision for the future of the American people and the future of the country as did I in the House of Representatives of the year 1985 and in the Senate of the year 1997 and 1995 and budget bills that were passed by this Chamber in the late 1990s.  This chart has existed in an effort to show this way forward. It is kind of confusing, but it shows two ways forward: one is which we are going to pass in a bipartisan way to deal with our broken immigration system, and the other is to deal with the poor infrastructure issues that many of us face in the

country committee tonight 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, we are here tonight to talk about a topic that is forefront on the minds of millions of Americans tonight and this week across this country: the Supreme Court nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts of Kansas to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Judiciary Committee, through a procedural rule, began deliberations of the Roberts nomination early this week and the comments we heard tonight are indicative of the frustration this issue has created among many Americans who have been without a Supreme Court nominee in a very long time.  Last Friday, the Judiciary Committee heard the testimony of Tom Perriello, the distinguished Democrat from Vermont. Tom's memory has been sorely wounded by the Wall Street meltdown he experienced in 2005 and the comments he made about John Roberts and the Supreme Court's role as the courts of last resort.  Last week, our friends on

federal claims commercial 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, what troubles me is this legislation creates a Federal express line where the Federal Government has to help the States determine what is considered in medical purposes to allow that very money which the States in some States use to use in commercial decisions that are made.  In other words, it only funds certain health claims. It does not fund other claims. There is no statutory authorization for Federal agencies to direct the States.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, as Republicans and Democrats debate the best way to reform health care, Americans are frustrated and worried about the quality of their health care and how it is paid for. They are especially concerned about what Republicans in Congress are doing to ensure that we can go on health insurance without making Americans pay more for it.  For too many Americans this year they are getting worse results and worse prices while going further and further from the needs that they already have and economy supports.  We need to change the system so that people don't have to change their health care plans so that they don't have to pay more, so that they don't have to pay more for it. That is why I have introduced the American Health Care Consumer Right to Know Act.  While it is a good idea to continue addressing high costs in healthcare, it

These barriers still exist today to my friend and to most of the Nation.  Of all of the issues he has raised that could significantly impact these States, one of the most important is the rise of paid-for toll service in my State of Texas and other States around the country. Since 1996 Customs and Border Protection has enacted and paid for all of the toll surcharges for this service. This has created a tremendous barrier to telecommunications in most of my State.

We agreed with you in the details to not do that, but the idea of saying we will agree to any compromise we agree to on issues discussed in this Chamber without having to have anything to offer to pay for it, I think is really deceptive to me.  The bill that is before us has been crafted in such a way to give ourselves the leverage to achieve

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lemanuel ``Lee'' Jones, who passed away on the evening of May 16 in California.  A career Marine Corps Army veteran of Vietnam and United States Central Command, Jones was killed in action during the fighting in the South China Sea on Saturday, May 17, 2006. He was a five-star member of the Army Rangers and was the first Texas Ranger to return from combat.  Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, Jones began his military career as a Marine out of the 7th Army's Military Vocational Command, which he joined in 1967. He graduated from Ranger school and was commissioned as a helicopter mechanic, flying away from the battlefield for medical treatment in Operation Rubicon, Operation Homecoming, and Operation Reclaiming San Antonio.  He was assigned to 7th Army's Criminal Investigation

jobs collapse speaker 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, one year ago, our economy was on the brink of collapse; Wall Street was collapsing; home prices had fallen 50 percent since the early 1970's and were still falling in the summer of 2006; unemployment still was higher than it had been in jobs since the late 1980's; and many families are still paying off student debt. Instead of addressing these problems head-on, Speaker Boehner and Republican leaders are pursuing another failed and failing economic philosophy that threatens working Americans and the middle class.  At a time when the President's tax cuts have brought unprecedented wealth and opportunity to millions of Americans, their administration is currently working on plans that will result in a $1 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest Americans and a payroll tax cut for the middle class. What about a $200 billion giveaway to the oil companies at a time when oil is

Mr. President, in 2015, when I heard then-candidate Donald Trump denigrate the service of my dad and me, I was in shock and dismay at his comments about my dad's service and the sacrifices my parents made in America to protect our values. I felt like someone from that generation had taken that away from me by telling my dad I would have done the same if he was Republican Senator McCain.  My dad was not just a POW, he was a hero. When I was 17, I volunteered to serve in the U.S. Army. I fought at Gettysburg. My mom worked as a nurse. At age 18, I enlisted and went to the Advanced Individual Training Corps in Fort Hood, TX.  During the first year of the Armed Forces, I received 1,028 combat wounds and 72 wounds in combat. These numbers

Mr. Chairman, a very wise former Governor of Indiana once said that you will never use a piece of legislation that is over 50 years old as a starting point for what you are going to do with it in the next 4 years. That has been the case here for quite a while because States have become involved in the health care business. The bill that we have offered is the latest chapter in that trend to bring new Federal business regulations to the marketplace. Chairman Coleman correctly noted that the Federal Government's role is to ensure that a health care plan meets the needs of its beneficiaries. However, Federal officials have demonstrated a tendency to ignore legislation that is over a longer period of time.  For example, at the close of business yesterday, February 18, the Federal Labor Relations Board issued final rule for the definition of employee health benefits. This

As the Chairman knows, the requirement that management plans indicate in advance the intent and resources needed to achieve the cost savings required to ensure that the legislation is passed does not mean that there are no cost savings to the taxpayer under the proposed legislation that Congress passes to provide the highway safety net that we do have.  That is why the Chairman requested that I emphasize the need for providing the public information. I do not believe that it is appropriate for the Federal Government to provide the public with a complete cost estimate of the cost of a new highway and transmission project in order to seek a specific amount of public support.

The latest figures show that this year there will be only $6 billion to $7 billion in funding to boost our infrastructure, so we need to come up with more money to be able to do that.  This partisan appropriation bill from the House will slash the Transportation Department's funding to less than 1 percent of the Federal budget.

If the Congress did not adopt the conference report before the convention, as requested, the disaster which could have been prevented by the conference report would have been aggravated. I think, under the circumstances, it is absolutely appropriate to pass the conference report and send it to the President for his signature. It is important to know that Congress had the opportunity to act and make the conference report. It did not. This is why a passage of this amendment would encourage the President to act promptly and save lives in this horrible crisis and in the aftermath.  I have also submitted a conference report on this measure, I guess, for the President to

The current process is as fair as it can be in the interest of the American public and the country and that is to rise to the occasion when the Government is in crisis and comes to the United States and deals with its people in the best way possible in the Western Hemisphere, in Central America.  So my view is this amendment would significantly alter the oversight procedure that is presently occurring.

Tobacco companies have received only $10.5 billion in excise taxes to cigarettes this year, a $42 million decrease over the same period last year, and a $95 million decrease since 1996, while tobacco taxes have continued to rise in 1993 to $54 million.  Our amendment to this bill includes three pieces of legislation which have bipartisan support. First, this bill restores the funding that was given to promote childhood health through family planning through the CPP. This bill also includes the Protecting Children from Tobacco, which would reauthorize the Food and Drug Administration's Register of Advisory Committees and Board of Directors and reaffirm the health

They simply do not get it. They do not understand why you have so many of them being in Congress that govern differently from the average American. They have been proven time and time again that the answer to their problems is nothing but debt and delay that is slowing the economy down and will cause imminent impending doom.  I remind my colleague from Colorado and my friend from Massachusetts, if we really want to protect our financial security, let's get people back to work and create jobs. If that means not having the ability to afford health care to our seniors, then that's part of what we do. And this is just another

Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the 25th anniversary of what can only be called the Nation's first new residential home program. Homes of the Department of Housing and Urban Development built in the city of Quincy, MO, will be sold by the end of this year to private companies to build new high-quality homes for formerly poor Freddie Mac tenants.  In the 1980s, after years of effective social service programs that involved residents working with low-income individuals and community organizations to acquire property corporation property, Quincy residents' desire for alternatives to paying rent increased as they became concerned that the type of low-income housing units they could purchase and maintain were not provided by the Federal Government.  An important factor was that many residents were economically disadvantaged and would not accept public housing simply because they needed a place to live. So the Quincy

Judge Breyer was nominated to the high court in January 2013, and we are seeing strong interest in his nomination come from his home State of California. In addition, Californians are hearing from their elected officials that the Judge is fair, even-handed, and understands the legitimate conflicts of interest that arise from an expansive and unpredictable office.  As someone who has gone through and experienced both the challenges and success of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, I find Judge Breyer to be an outstanding nominee.

In fact, the amendment to the House bill would go to that effect and would require a waiver and would require only that States issue final regulations that would meet the standards set out in that bill and would not impose additional new requirements to comply with the agreed-upon standards. I believe that is going to be the basis for a rule.  I am a cosponsor of the amendment to the Senate bill that was enacted yesterday. I think it strikes the correct balance.

tax adjust difference 

Final sequence: 

But as the Senator's chart demonstrates, if you adjust that for inflation, what your GDP figure shows is $10 billion that is lost because it is not available to invest today in the things that need to be done to get this economy going again. It is my understanding that tax cuts benefit only the very wealthiest Americans at the cost of the average working American. Does that mean there is nothing left in terms of a reduction in the deficit because we have that money not going out there because we have to adjust it to make up for that difference?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this negative amendment that would eliminate funding for both the Homeland Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security. The funding in this amendment would reduce the size of the majority of the Federal government and would increase the number of States that would be eligible to receive Federal funding for these critical functions.  The President asked this question and this amendment should take that question seriously because decisions must be made where we are going to operate.  The DoD budget increases are critical to every State in our country. This amendment would unnecessarily reduce funding for programs like the Human Research Program and research into new cancer drugs. This is exactly the kind of spending the American people want and deserve.  This amendment threatens to severely restrict the funding for the Transportation Security Administration, and the House rejected that amendment by overwhelming votes. The EPA

By my own count, there are almost 20 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in existence and a billion barrels of oil in existence. I think, when we consider that this is the second largest economy in the world, about $60 billion worth of investment for each of our 26 nations, we should be able to find savings of over $40 billion through this creation of such an environment

Mr. Speaker, the level of Medicare and Medicaid cuts would gut health care for the millions of seniors who rely on Medicaid to get by. In New York alone, just over $130 billion a year would be lost. Even the largest drug company in the world will lose almost $3 billion out of a breathtaking $7 billion in drug savings. There are no words to describe it. It is gutting seniors' health care coverage, in a way that will hurt the taxpayers, endangering small businesses, and making real the promised promise to Americans that Medicare will be there for them, not the government, to protect them.  Again, the ranking member of the committee, Mr. Barletta, urges us to take up health care reform immediately. We have been working this problem long enough. Let's vote for it.<|endoftext|>

A decade from now, under the existing law we would continue to allow drilling that would have a dramatic effect on the ocean bottom for up to 65 years. If we want to take the OPT plan more into account in the future, we will need to stop relying so heavily on the promises that we are about to make and start thinking about what we really need to be doing.

This money will provide access to a worldwide marketplace to various exchanges, at least that is what we will have to say when we can announce this new entity.  We are not talking about putting up the cost for another government-owned vehicle that it really seems to me to be the epitome of we-help-the-little guy, but more in the philosophical sense of

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, last week, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed S. Res. 102, a resolution I wrote to the President, calling for a second critical vote on the Iran nuclear deal that was scheduled for this week to vote on it this year after the first vote on the last nuclear deal that was ultimately approved this week in the House of Representatives was not allowed to result in the ability for the Iran nuclear deal to go into effect before September 30th because of the recent Iranian missile submarines being detected off the coast of Israel. This latest sea-related intelligence warning provides strong evidence that Tehran is actively working to prevent the United States from setting a deal with Iran on the prohibition of its ballistic missiles and nuclear facilities.  This, unfortunately, was the first time in U.S. history that the President has vetoed a key U.S. foreign policy tool

Nancy Pelosi's health care plan, which she has said she is proud of, will allow 95 percent of her income to go directly to the individual taxpayer, but for the rest of the money, $1.2 million worth, she will be taking a share of it, rather than giving the majority of it to the American taxpayer, at least 90 percent of it. This is something we must demand of our elected officials in the House and the Senate.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, they could, only where necessary to protect human life or to protect the safety of the American people or other Members of this House or other Members of the administration would prevent any of the frivolous and unreasonable penalties and other things that are in this bill today, if you will not allow the level of punishment to go into this bill, and to give the top officials within the Justice Department and then have the filibuster on the other side of the aisle on the other side of the aisle work as we should.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

additional defense increase 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, last year I stood in this well and called on my colleagues to reach out to every Member of this body to begin the important work of working together to help our country recover from the devastation of 9/11 and to provide some additional security to the American people that have been so negatively impacted by it. That has been the plan that has been passed that is our current defense bill. But there is another measure of what needs to be done to help that effort continue to increase.  Every Member of this House has a unique role in that effort. I had the opportunity to work with some people that are important to working for security in this country, and, as I said in my opening remarks last year, one of the things that I found so refreshing about working with so many people, even folks in the security world

The  Continuity of Government Act of 1995 requires that detention facilities in the Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service designate entry and exit points from the U.S. back to foreign countries for the duration of an immigration case. These screening devices are provided to detention facilities by the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency. These screening devices also cover officers who are involved in Customs and Border Protection activities.  This facility agreement provides access to these screening devices so that an officer

I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Royce and the other Members for their bill for $14 million to help close a $2 billion program that for several years has made it possible for the military to receive data on the number of foreign planes that land at our small airports in the country. The $14 million already provided for this program at the time this bill was closed in stock exchanges last week was being used to upgrade equipment and to upgrade computers and to upgrade radar. Now, that is all fine and dandy. But if the money is used to purchase and upgrade computers, or if it is used for terrorism, then the Department of Homeland Security has

On Wednesday, following morning business, the Senate will resume the FAA bill and the pending Transportation bill which will be under consideration on Monday of this week and may be closed to the public once that bill is completed and it can be returned to the Senate for its consideration on a final conference report to the Senate. Therefore we will have to make a change in the way we do business on Monday of this week so we can turn to that piece of legislation. We cannot rule on the FAA bill until the Transportation bill comes back. So we will have to wait until tomorrow to make that determination.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker I am very aware of it, and for that reason it becomes meaningless. It is simply irrelevant. It is simply not very useful in the context in which it is presented. It is not very helpful when we are really concerned about what is really important to know here about what are the facts on what happened in the moratorium of President Clinton and what are the facts about what happened in the moratorium signed by the President that was instituted after the fact. It is very helpful in that context because we are concerned about what happened but we are concerned about what we know we know we know not really aware that it happened, and therefore we need to keep our eye out, and I have brought forth the language, the specifics of the partial merger, and I think we have an obligation to make sure we pass on to the American people and

The legislation before us would allow the Department of Energy to effectively provide the resources for the continued use of this Nation's advanced technologies while protecting the country from a new and likely significant threat from the future which the main vulnerabilities and threats of our age include widespread dependence on foreign oil and, particularly, the threat from more exotic sources of fuel. It is also important to point out that this is a fair and balanced approach to balancing the budget as we know it. The bill before us moves us on, both in the tax policy as well as in the ways to

Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend the majority has not raised any concerns about this alternative in its support of this particular bill and the fact that it is supported by the United States Army, which I know is in full agreement with this because this is not a welfare reform bill in the sense of a welfare bill in which there is a $20 billion increase in spending to pay for $10 million for armor that, of course, is going to come out of the payroll of the Army of the United States.  I would hope that the American people would understand that it would not be a military expenditure, but would not be in any way giving them that benefits that we are asking them to put at risk.  It would save money, not use military funds, nor take funds

The same year when we passed the family tax cut, welfare spending went up by 4 percent. Even at $350 billion in 1996, you still had an increase of $3.6 billion.
