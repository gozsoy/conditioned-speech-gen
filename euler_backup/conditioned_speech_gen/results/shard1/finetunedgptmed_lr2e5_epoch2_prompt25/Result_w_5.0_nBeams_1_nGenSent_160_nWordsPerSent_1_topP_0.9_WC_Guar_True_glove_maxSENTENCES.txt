Mr. Chairman, the bill before us, H.R. 3870, the Environmental Technologies Act of 1994, states that the Director of OSTP shall develop priorities for Federal assistance for research and development activities and priorities for environmental assessment and monitoring and review activities. The bill also says that the Secretary of Commerce shall continue to exercise appropriate oversight over such activities and that the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the various elements of the Federal agencies charged with environmental issues shall be authorized to direct those elements to develop a plan for the purposes of carrying out environmental science-based technology transfer programs, unless specifically constrained by other authorities of law.  The Secretary of Commerce shall develop priority programs for certain environmentally important industries to be provided small priority assistance based on the extent to which those industries meet the Federal research and development priorities established in this Act.  There is one glaring omission from this bill, Mr. Chairman. The bill does not correct one of the fundamental mistakes of the Republican farm bill.

Mr. President, I stand to use this opportunity to again focus us on what I think is a very significant issue in this ongoing ethics debate that I think is really going to make a lot of Senate Members really think about what we would do if we had the opportunity to actually do something about lobbying reform in this country.  What we know about what happened in the House of Representatives yesterday with the conclusion of their important reform--it took a few days of debate and discussion but it resulted in a very significant change in how the lobby disclosure rules are applied by the Congress.  The Washington Post reported yesterday that members of the House Republican leadership worked on a list for the first time, along with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the other Republican leaders in the House, to make lobby disclosure reforms in the 104th Congress. It turns out that those same Republican leaders had discussed this change in lobbying disclosure rules some months ago when there was still considerable dissent

Mr. President, President Theodore Roosevelt once wrote, ``Death is always and under all circumstances a tragedy, for if it is not, then it meant that life was very hard to endure. But it is a matter of human nature to seek the happiness that we can only come to on the small times that we do live.'' President Theodore Roosevelt wrote of the image of God that is portrayed in the Rocky Mountains. The images of death that arise in the Rocky Mountains give comfort to even the most hardened of souls. As Wyoming begins its new year, our family receives a devastating loss.  Rita U. E. Campbell was born in Missouri on March 6, 1915. An orphan, she grew up as a mule driven by a cow by her mother.

I agree that osteoporosis should be the focus of aggressive detection, prevention and treatment activities. We owe it to our own and future generations to ensure that this disease is completely preventable and treated as effectively as possible. In order to do so we must focus our public health and life-science research on the mechanisms that are responsible for osteoporosis's progression and do what we can to slow this disease's morbidity and mortality. I recognize that there is still a great deal of work to be done, especially on cardiovascular disease; but as I stated earlier this evening, the most recent National Institutes of Health study equates cardiovascular disease death causation as negligible or nonexistent compared to Alzheimer's dementia causation.

What this does is it provides a second set of short term fixes that correct the last 10 years of payments of Medicaid, the insurance program for the poor and disabled.  Again, again I find it very strange because this is an issue where in a lot of countries people are poor and working people, they pay into the system.

The funding would have been zero. If we would have allowed it to go back to 1990 levels, it would have been $80 billion. That was basically what the Democrats' focus was, sending more money to the wealthy.  We worked hard on education to rebuild our crumbling schools, to rebuild our crumbling roads.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today, 1 day after the 23d anniversary of Roe versus Wade, many people were up here to recognize this fact, to come to this floor in support of this bill.  Roe versus Wade has been rejected by the Supreme Court that was created by abortion and allowed to be used. It is rejected by physicians that deal in patient care and doctors in dealing with procedure.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is an attempt to send a message, but it is not a message that I support or that I was happy to vote in support of. This bill is really a throwback to a time where, in this country, it was rare to have two opinions in one day, not unheard of in our country. This legislation is an opportunity for a vote on a legislative compromise that will allow a woman to be able to use her own money in her home to travel to and from the abortion clinic, at a reasonable cost.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply prohibits the EPA from using the Chesapeake Bay total maximum reuse permit authority for the sake of all rivers and wetlands in the Western United States and those intended for protection under the Clean Water Act and other Federal laws to restore waters to which they have been legally designated as nontarget-fish refuge areas. I would say to my good amendment, Mr. Chairman, to do so would basically force the EPA to approve the restoration of fisheries in any of these areas without prior authority from Congress. I would say to my good amendment, Mr. Chairman, to be signed into law would indeed cause irreparable harm to the coastal rivers and wetlands that are not in the President's declared wild and scenic rivers and lands, but in our bayous, because you would then preempt the entire area of the bayous for which the Chesapeake's total maximum reuse permit is intended

Mr. President, the provisions of ISTEA, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, expired on September 30, 1997. The Senate took up the ISTEA reauthorization bill last November after the House failed to act on legislation that would reauthorize the act for a total of 6 years at an annual budget of $30 billion. Senate Finance Chairman Simon and Senators Kennedy and Murray passed ISTEA, I believe, by voice vote last week. The bill would also reauthorize surface transportation programs at the State and local levels.  Congress acted with Republican governors to establish a Surface Transportation Board to administer the act in the areas of trucking, boat, and rail operations. The authorizing committee, the Surface Transportation Board, is comprised of both Republicans and Democrats, and its jurisdiction includes highways, airports, railroads, and airports.  The House acted this spring to authorize the board, but this did not include an additional 5-year authorization, again, that expired September 30

Mr. Chairman, it seems to me, since we agree, that the problem is that the Pentagon has never explained where its money is going, and the Congress needs to make sure we know how they are going to use this money.

I thank the Speaker. Mr. Speaker, when will the gentlewoman recognize the fact that the Medicare Program is in very serious trouble? The President's trustees report out in December of 2005 said that we would need a massive increase in Medicare spending to deal with the problem that the Republicans have outlined for us and which they have proposed to solve today with a solution that does not involve the social safety net but which includes an increase in the guaranteed Medicare benefits. And Speaker Gingrich, in a speech he gave a few weeks ago, the trustees report says that the predicted increases in Medicare spending for this year and the following year will be roughly equivalent in terms of new spending to the comprehensive dictionary-version bill that is in this bill. In other words, if we are going to spend $250 billion of tax dollars to pay for all the cuts in Medicare in this bill, we should not be taking $250 billion out of the funds for programs that we have.

And there can be no doubt that this is precisely the type of law the people of the United States desire and expect this Congress to respect and implement and maintain the separation of powers so that the laws of the land that we write, the laws of the people, cannot be repealed. That is precisely the kind of ``special law'' we would want.  I was happy to attend that massive event in the middle of the weekend that was being held in Sutherland Springs, AR.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with Senator Inhofe to establish the Oklahoma City National Memorial and create the Oklahoma City Memorial Trust. I believe it is important to set an example and memorialize the service and sacrifice of so many Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for the United States of America.  The United States of America was founded on a clear promise to all of our citizens that one day each generation, they would become fully sovereign, independent, and independent of the Government of the United States. We were here at the founding of this country. At the time, there were only two Colonies left in the world: the newly emerging colonies of the British Empire and the fledgling colonies of the United States. During those troubled times, many of the pioneering statesmen chose to leave behind large numbers of men and women who cared about the future of this Nation as well as the wellbeing of their families, homes, and communities.

Thank you, Chairman Thompson. I really appreciate your organizing this Special Order. I am glad you picked this topic because we need to tell the American people that when we talk about health care reform and what is included in this bill, we really do need to come together and be united in the United States Congress and our country on how we can get people to have access to quality, affordable health care.  It's sad that we have to talk about this, because the whole point of the bill was that we were going to do something very different from what we have done for the last 25 years when it comes to health care and what Americans pay for it.  When I talk to people, they don't think it's that hard to get good health care. It is not that hard to go to the doctor, to get a diagnosis, to understand what that diagnosis might be and a plan. But if you don't have insurance,

Mr. President, today for the second week in a row the Senate Judiciary Committee's agenda included a proposed amendment to the Constitution, to its fundamental purpose of maintaining the Republic of the Judiciary and preventing abuse of authority. This constitutional amendment would require a supermajority vote in Congress before the Justice Department may participate in criminal investigations involving a Federal criminal case involving a person who is indicted on criminal charges. In addition, if the Justice Department in a criminal case involving charges of theft, fraud, or other misdemeanors submits to a grand jury and starts an investigation without a reasonable expectation of criminal justice results, the bill would preempt criminal prosecution of such conduct. These violations of our citizen's right to be free from unreasonable government intrusion clearly require a supermajority vote in Congress. I do not believe such a bill is necessary to properly fulfill the basic function of our justice system. Yet this proposed constitutional amendment is so important to the people of America, I have

But when you have worked with your Congress to pass every major piece of the so-called so-called civil rights bill during the last 8 years, you can come to this floor and talk about one thing more than words and gestures. What you need to talk about is action. And action is the only real way to change this appalling state of affairs.  We have not passed a single legislation to ensure that students with disabilities, people of color, women, LGBTQ, and other members of the community are afforded full and equal access to higher education in the United States.

We say to this Mr. Ellison, you were married to your great-grandmother when you were at the age of 19, and you lived there for almost a century and a half, with your parents living in India for about half of that time.

Madam Speaker, for the first time since 1974, the House has failed to pass a budget resolution. Instead of making tough decisions, congressional Democrats have failed to consider the economic challenges our Nation faces and the time in which we must get back on our feet and rebuild our economic infrastructure before any action is taken on the House floor. We must act now and reduce the Nation's deficit in a way that will help create jobs and boost our economy by beginning the process of helping middle class and working families to make it through this tough economic leadership time.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I would like to offer a bipartisan proposition to my colleagues here in the nature of this amendment. The reason I say this idea enjoys bipartisan support is because it has been so successful in our State of Colorado in not only lowering the law at the local level but so successful that now that we are here in Congress we are even able to work with the Governor of that State to sort of focus defense discretionary spending on what is the best use of our taxpayer dollars that we can make and what is in the best interest of our citizens and our Federal tax dollars and how we can do it the right way rather than how we are spending these tax dollars that amendment members so much like to see spent.  That is what this idea is about because it is so unique to this particular nature of the amendment that I offer, so I hope all of my colleagues will support the idea that this is a bipartisan way to deal with this vitally important problem

He has raised campaign finance issues and constitutional amendments and other legal issues in order to deal with the Court of Appeals and to bring this bill to the floor before it is filed in a few hours. And the only reason why we are in this problem is because he has taken the lead on all of that in his leadership in the Senate and in the Carolina delegation.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to continuation of a failed farm policy that takes from the poor to give to the rich. It is a fact that the Democrats have passed legislation to end this $300 billion-a-year giveaway to the very wealthy but this legislation that we now know is not the bill they wanted has passed the House on every single day this year and is now before the Senate for a vote in the Senate because this is what they thought it was going to be this whole thing all along because this thing seems so kind of straightforward, except that this is not about paying for these things. It is about doing so to aid the wealthy at the expense of the middle-class, the poor and the middle-aged.

We are not objecting to a bill that has not even been filed, and that is the budget resolution. There is no question of that. We will be offering an amendment and then there will be debate and then a vote on the President's budget resolution. The process of the budget process is pretty much done on a bipartisan basis here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives because the way the budget process works is if the motion to proceed moves speedily through the process, we can advance legislation, amendments, and have a vote on a budget resolution.

It simply would provide that the National Threat Assessment and Assessment Center would not be prohibited from providing technical assistance to private cybersecurity companies and organizations to secure and protect networks and computer networks of the United States.  My amendment, as adopted, also prevents the Department of Homeland Security from determining, nor provide any funding or infrastructure assistance to any business or organization that utilizes ``threat model indicators, threat models, or other information or data analysis that effectively identifies or defends against the transmission, disclosure, or use of malicious software in cyberspace'' without first seeking an exception from this bill.  As we know, in response to last month's attacks against the electrical grid in New York, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania, the Federal Government, and private companies have embarked upon a national cyber security initiative to help identify and remediate this emerging vulnerability.

Mr. President, the 1994 elections were elections about reform. Those of us sent here by the people of America were asked to make substantial changes to a system that seemed broken to most Americans at the time and that was then a political by-product of the first two decades of the 20th century and that was the second most recent set of reforms that made for a more democratic political process in our Nation.  The agenda of reform then was more about government making improvements to people's lives than about the perfecting of political philosophies. The desire of the American people in 1994 was not to throw overboard their best years of political experience and politics to be captured in the White House, to be stuffed into expensive suits, while lobbyists, and fellow insiders, decide who could get elected to the Congress in this body.  The American people in 1994 wanted change. They wanted politics to improve in a way that freed them from their worst impulses and, at

If a State passes a death penalty waiver after a full and open hearing in Utah under title V, will the Attorney General be allowed to revoke the death penalty waiver and apply the death penalty in the State where it is requested by the State?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, if Chairman Domenici were here tonight, he would urge our colleagues to oppose the Sununu amendment because it is critical to this clean bill for the next 10 years. And I want to do a number of things on this very important bill. One of the things I wish to do is to take into consideration the history of solar technology which started with the development of radio wave technology. This technology advanced by this research is what we refer to as the radio-wave source energy revolution. This technology enables electrical devices to communicate and to operate without power and that is going to put our cars and our homes and our schools and businesses out of business. The way to solve that is with the Sununu amendment which is an important part of this clean energy.  So if there is one thing we need to do to ensure that the advanced technologies that we are talking about with solar technology are there to continue this process, it is to say

Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reserve Board is meeting to consider yet another hike in interest rates. Democrats are united in opposing this increase, because we know that Congress is taking the wrong action by continuing to allow Federal Reserve money to run out at this time, and so in its wisdom, it has increased interest rates by inflation rates as it has done every year since 2000 in order to stimulate economic growth and by creating more jobs in the process. In fact, it could actually lead to more people being employed right now if we just continued to do what we have to do to kill that inflationary mood and spur economic growth.  The administration, however, sees inflation, real inflation, as a threat, and now wants to continue to use this automatic monetary policy to try to take more money out of the hands of individuals and put it in the hands of government.  It is estimated that under the Republican proposal, the Federal Reserve would be able to

Mr. Speaker, under the guise of saving Medicare, the majority would make funding cuts that would have the effect of reducing benefits to Medicare recipients--and the benefits that are best provided for in the program have to be paid for by an increase in taxes, as well as by the majority's own budget. The Medicare recipients who depend upon Medicare for their health care insurance are being asked to bear additional burden, and they do not deserve it.  Mr. Speaker, just last year, a study by the Social Security Administration estimated that 75 percent of senior citizens rely on Medicare for health care. In other words, 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries rely upon this Federal program. Despite the fact that the number of beneficiaries in our country has grown at a frightening rate, the enrollment on the part of Medicare recipients has increased little over half the 8 percent increase in the population since the early 1970's. The role of private insurance has increased while the percentage of Americans who

These kinds of actions are appropriate for these specific health care needs of public servants and cost taxpayers billions of dollars a year in increased health care costs. These health care expenditures should be not only limited but specifically and specifically identified for Federal fiscal finance purposes by the President as part of any proposal to increase the Federal deficit. For reasons which I will comment later on the Bradley amendment, it is unnecessary and counterproductive for the Federal Government to specifically identify these health care expenses for Federal fiscal purposes.

It has been around for almost 200 years, but not for very long. After the Revolutionary War, the public became increasingly concerned about the horses roaming around. There were petitions calling for the eradication of horse and burros, and many Americans formed a National Round Horse Control Organization. I was also a member of the National Round Horse Control Organization. This movement involved the banning of horses from Kentucky and Tennessee, the taking of them from their

I thank the gentleman for his comments, because that is exactly right, and it is the same old story, and the same old game, and it is going to continue to be a game until it ends that the American public does not want to know about and the Government does not want to believe is going on at all in this town because this is just small business tax and spend that the Government takes out and has already spent and should not be taking out to pay for the many other things they are already doing that are not small business business businesses but are big companies that do not need this kind of help as far as new areas of the story.  They are trying to come up with something this month, maybe even before June 1, called Cut, Cap, and Balance.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. This project seems to have become the poster child for all those who wish to control our water resources in the western United States and is an example of a project that the West is on the cutting edge of in the area of water quality.  While this project contains many scientific benefits, it will also come with the costs of having thousands of individuals very close to the lands in which the tribe wants to construct an irrigation canal, a project that threatens the constitutional rights of other Utah citizens to gather at their customary lands, waters, and borders. In addition to that, the proposal is certainly dangerous and it has no place in the desert of the West. The tribe has made promises to their lands which now have become the locks, gravel road to the water side of their reservation. These highway locks threaten to hinder its efforts to develop the water-supply supplies of their reservation.

Madam President, today we remember Richard Dudman, who passed away this August in Blue Hill, ME, at the age of 99. Throughout his long and distinguished career, Richard was a true patriot and a husband and father of two children. He passed away in his home on June 10 after long and courageous years of illness. I will continue to work with President George W. Bush on a number of important issues, including the Chemical Weapons Convention and related legislation, as well as continuing to work to enhance domestic assistance to our States and other important allies in the Middle East.  Richard, for all of his many accomplishments, was always a dedicated and determined public servant. He was a legislator, chairman of the Maine State Legislature, Lieutenant Governor, and a State Senator. A patriot and a loyal friend, Dick's lifelong interests in public service were deeply rooted in his Methodist faith.

Mr. President, the World Trade Organization has just issued its first decision in a trade case brought under the new dispute settlement system. The case is the largest trade dispute in the Organization's history involving most of the world's third-largest trade blocs but also small- and medium-sized regional blocs like Chile and Canada. The decision is not whether we should do anything about it but whether to take action to respond to the decision we deserve to make based on the well-reasoned consensus rules of the dispute and the merits of the case before us. This decision will decide which way the Obama administration will go.  On November 5, the administration announced its settlement. Let's look at the consequences. The outcome has a huge impact not only on our economy and small businesses in America but on the whole world.

Mr. President, I am happy to cosponsor Senator Pressler's amendment to S. 1365, the school-to-work bill. This amendment will help address the unique needs of rural and low-income communities and States by providing a system of the Federal Government which will enable States to establish workforces in areas where the local population is already much larger and where the educational and job opportunities are much better than in the North.  Mr. President, States and communities in this country often have access to schools, libraries, and other public services which are not available to the rest of our Nation. This is especially true in rural areas, where people's individual needs are often the most challenging.  Mr. President, I have often said that it is inappropriate for the Government to create an environment where poor people live in poverty and cannot learn. Therefore, it is particularly unwise for States to discriminate against those who live in rural areas and schools which offer in the most disadvantaged areas.

Last week, the U.S. President called for our Afghanistan exit to be determined on his watch.  Today the Taliban and al Qaeda are claiming credit for the July 3, 2009 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Zabul that killed two Americans.

We started talking to a good friend who is a senior official in the Justice Department, and he told us that one of the things that had to go through our administration was to deal with the problems of the gentleman from Michigan who had managed his case and who had been through this process and because of that he had to take his case to court. Because they are and are not local parks, and I would point out to the gentleman from Michigan that this gentleman was able to get that public benefit. He has won his case, but he lost too.  So that is the problem that we have got to confront in this instance. The other thing is, it does look as if our environmental judges, because of their intense interest in things they think are so in jeopardy, are going to become

I think that's right. Again, I think it's probably not even that clear in terms of what they can do because, essentially, as I read it from what they say, it would just provide the money to ensure that we are not just going back to the way things were in the Clinton years rather than what we need to be doing so we have the kind of quality of life we need to have. We know from our experience in the States that are going to be good places to work that we can do just that because it simply would go back to the way things were in the Clinton years rather than the way we need to be doing in the next 10 years to keep Mexico together and work together. And I think that's why it's not so clear.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2669, the ``Anti-Spoofing Act of 2015''. I am honored to have authored this bill with the bill managers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Costello), and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hall). This legislation is the product of many hours of phone calls to the district I represent in central Illinois.  Mr. Speaker, the central Illinois Congressman has, I believe, made one of the most important contributions to this legislation that I have seen in this Congress. His advice and ideas have been invaluable. The Judiciary Committee, like the Energy and Commerce Committee, devoted the most time to drafting this legislation because the bill, as we now know, reflects the work of members from both committees. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 93, that any adjustment in the Consumer Price Index should be determined only by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The Consumer Price Index estimates consumer price increases based on the year in which they occur in the price of a basket of goods and services that are purchased by consumers at wholesale prices and that average 25 percent higher than prices in the average year of this year and 10 percent higher than prices in previous years because prices rise on a consistent basis. This bill's proposed implementation rate would vary according to inflation, seasonal variation, consumer price index fluctuations, the size and pay of firms in the business sector, and the demand for products.  Unlike the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reports its earnings on a monthly basis, the CPI provides a quarterly calculation on an annual basis, keeping people's costs in mind. Therefore, every quarter of the year the CPI is adjusted upward to keep inflation and certain

Chairman Roth said this is the way to deal with America's most important problem: capital gains taxes.

What has been cut in these programs is about $3 billion of space station funding.  One of the best parts of this and what I am afraid the other side will not go for is going to cut back on Medicare for our senior citizens in this country. Under the previous Democratic leadership of the Congress, we had some of the worst Medicare cuts in the entire history of the country and did not even come close to recovering any money. Under the Republican leadership of the Congress we have restored the Medicare program for our seniors in this country today. This is really a good program

Continuing my reservation of objection, Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that I do not necessarily share the gentleman's judgment about the wisdom of the nature of the benefit that we have made available to our Nation through the assistance we have been given by the people of these many States as they work hard to get their local officials to step up and meet the needs that they have when they come through the poverty line and experience the unemployment that comes with that and the health crises that come with that and the intervening economic downturn, that this is the kind of thing that we ought to do, especially when we are not going to be back here for the wisdom of it.

I will say the National Endowment for Democracy is not specified in here as a recipient of this money, but the debate did sound remarkably familiar to Senator Rockefeller and me. I can only assume that the McCain-Feingold amendment has some overlap with the sound theme that the distinguished Senator from New York used earlier when he started this very long dialogue. There have been some occasions during the time when there have been so many complaints about the inability of the CIA to protect the American people and to protect Americans from these savage regimes that have used their own money and put our citizens in danger, it seems to me that this country should have some sort of guarantee that they are the kind of people that can be counted upon to protect Americans.  I hope that if we find a way to attack the foreign funding, we can just get a straight answer from the President about how much he wishes to add to this money. So I just would say

Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the legislation offered by my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I am an original cosponsor of this amendment and have voted for it before. Senator Brown has been a staunch advocate of civil rights legislation since he began his Senate career in the Senate back in 1972.  This amendment would repeal a key provision of the National Labor Relations Act which prohibits the use of ``outcome-based'' determination criteria to implement federal rulemaking rules unless all of the parties pledge to abide by the federal agreement prior to a rulemaking--including community participation.  The labor movement came together to preserve important labor rights after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even as it joined forces with the Department of Defense in establishing the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Commission, UERR, to review cases involving unfair labor practices by the Department of Defense.  I believe the Bush administration

I thank the gentleman from Georgia who raises an excellent point, that is, how the United States is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign lenders, foreign borrowers, for financing its national security needs. The United States was the largest lender in the world in 1996 and in 2004 was the second largest. While that is certainly the case in the world today and may become the case in the future, the interest rates we now have to pay in the United States for United States Government and international bonds is far too high. Georgia's idea was to make available a safe haven for the global economy by having American companies lend money to more emerging markets.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

We are close on this one, and we have had some floor work done on that one too. But we are not in position to go into the specifics of this amendment right now. So we are agreeable to either one.  If Senators want to discuss it, let me understand the time agreement and discuss it with Senator Exon or Senator Sessions, or, if Senator DeMint wants to talk about it, let me talk about it. We can work out a time agreement. I believe, under the arrangements I have with Senator Specter, we can go through this amendment later today. We do not have an agreement now.

Mr. President, at the end of May, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and a consortium of meatpacking companies announced an innovative pilot project in which the American consumer will be paid to pay for our immigration policy. Under this program, immigrants who are employed in the meatpacking industry are paying as much as $1,000 for every nickel their families earn in America.  This demonstrates how cheap labor is in America today and how America has the power to transform labor exploitation into a positive role for American industry and our economy. We pay these immigrants as much as $1,000 a week to watch American workers labor and slaughter Americans. How much can they pay? What kind of wage are they earning? What happens to the American worker? How much does it cost to import raw beef and pork from Canada?  It is this capitalist system that destroyed the Soviet Union, and we still do not have enough control over our borders.  This innovative program

Access to affordable health care is one of the most pressing issues facing America today and it is health care as a service and not as a political issue. As Americans take up this bill to move our country toward more affordable and well-run health care systems, we must honor their demand for fairness and include them in the legislative process as well.  Health care, which affects every American, has always been considered an issue of equity and not a political issue. In this time of rigid partisanship, where not only Democrats but also Republicans are afraid to cooperate with the incoming President, I think it is especially important that we recognize the ever present good will of this nation and our commitment to our democratic principles.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, my State of Louisiana has faced four hurricanes, a recession, and now has one of the worst unemployment rates in the country. Louisiana needs jobs and resources to be able to take care of its people and pay their bills and put food on the table, but if the majority doesn't care about job creation and workers' opportunities, then Louisiana and the Nation will fail.  Louisiana desperately needs jobs, but unfortunately, even though we're facing one of the worst unemployment rates in the country, this resolution takes us backward. Louisiana has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country. A proposed 17 percent decrease in the minimum wage is extremely detrimental to the people who have nothing to do with this legislation.

We cannot simply say, let us do nothing.

Mr. Chairman, the budget neutral Bereuter amendment restores the $25,160,000 to the current funding level of the Food for Development United States food assistance program for the developing world for hunger programs and nutrition assistance to indigenous peoples in developing countries. The Food and Agriculture Development Exchange, an international partnership which the USDA administers with the United Nations, also provides grants to support the expansion of food and nutrition programs for hunger and preventative health systems in developing countries.  Much of this funding has been allocated to rural and low-income development programs in particular in the world's poorest regions, especially those whose population, average age, and diet in rich and poor regions varies widely. It is my understanding that in fact Africa, Central America, South Asia, and the Sub-Sahara region have the poorest diets in developing countries.

Mr. President, this proposal would instruct the conferees to accept the House provision that expands the qualified veterans mortgage bond program. The qualified veterans mortgage bond program is a private mortgage loan program that would benefit veterans with over $200,000 in income to get to a qualified unit of local government which would be established to take over the financial burden of the Federal Government in that area of our country for the first time in American history and put it in the States. I will be very surprised if we do not immediately, by that time, adopt this provision.  Mr. President, the bill before us includes language, obviously, which would deny the application of the existing minority to the issue of qualified veterans mortgage bond. One of the reasons for that legislation was to fix a problem which was created in my own State, Senator Bennett's State.

It provides critical support for children in many areas. It provides jobs and a safety net.  SNAP is one of the largest food programs in the Nation.

It is one thing to say that if you are a woman you should be able to get the health care that you want and that you need and that you need now in America today but it is another thing to tell American women that they cannot get that health care in America because of the decisions that have been made here in the Congress.  In 1973, Roe v. Wade, the first Supreme Court case to allow women to have a constitutionally protected right to an abortion, was declared unconstitutional.

Madam Speaker, stopping the tax hike is not just about taxes; it's about jobs. Small businesses have been responsible for about two-thirds of the new jobs that have been created in this country in the last 10 years; small businesses create more jobs than any other group of companies. And they pay taxes, so that is the reason that President Obama has proposed a massive increase in taxes on the American people as part of his stimulus bill. There is not a single Republican that I know who has voted for Speaker Pelosi's plan that will create jobs, pay taxes, or a national energy policy, which means no jobs for small businesses.  The numbers that you cited would put almost $2 billion back in the pockets of the American people, for people who are making $60,000 or less.

Mr. Speaker, I hope the body realizes the gentleman from Georgia was actually there and part of it, so it is a very historic time in this country when the gentleman came back to this House to represent his district in the very time that we are here now, but in many ways it is a time for coming together and maintaining the balance of the knowledge that is available to the American public as it was before the attack of September 11. The Committee on Armed Services has been working very closely and very cooperatively with the Committee on Appropriations on that reserve fund in one respect, because the resources that we have, we do not have to balance this bill on its own. The military officers are aware of the limitations, but they are already, as they say, in the book when they say to us, well, you just are missing a problem, as they have. The resources to meet a major threat to our national security and to security

This is a process that is ongoing today to determine whether we should deal with this particular decision of the President.  And I think there is no question in anybody's mind that there are significant economic factors as to the profit and loss that will be put forth on the body by whoever it is.

So we will try to craft that a little bit in the coming days so that as we go to conference it will be in bulk, that there will be an intelligence bill that is in bulk for that group of people who we were going to send to conference.

DREAMers, of course, refers to children who were brought here as minors from the child welfare system in order to gain permanent legal status in the United States, and that is why they are so important to this country today and President Obama has taken the necessary actions to allow them to have rights in this country that so many others in this country have not yet been given to them and is such an act of great compassion and decency.

Mr. President, what this amendment does is deal with innovative bridge research and construction. There is such a program. This would include the development of innovative new research and development technologies which can be applied to enhance the performance of bridges.  For example, if we look at the integrated steel systems research and evaluation program, which is funded by this amendment, an innovative effort will be undertaken to develop new materials and technologies which could enhance the life cycle life of a bridge from construction through refurbishment.  I think we are going to get some experimental information that we need to work in at that point, but I am sure we will be looking to have demonstration projects in this area as we move forward.

For example, President Obama and Defense Secretary Gates in August, when addressing the Nation, talked about the need for personnel to continue to have ``open channels of communication to address his concerns on this issue and other matters.''

Mr. Speaker, I realize, if my colleagues have made up their mind that they want to vote against the bill, the best way to do it is to vote to give the Members of this House the opportunity to do so before they leave town tomorrow afternoon at the earliest possible time and go back to their homes to celebrate family time and return to the country for the weekend. I want to speak on behalf of the House and my colleagues and say that we are in need of additional funding in this medical research bill that is currently pending in the other body.  This is a very important issue. The American Medical Association has indicated that in 2004, there would be 28,000 lost jobs, and it would be estimated that this health care bill would cost $21 billion to make a positive impact on the economy and help create jobs, but only if this bill passes. We are in crisis. There are people in our country whose health care has gone

I am here today because the death of Beau Biden not only honors the memory of our late friend and colleague, but it brings the country to a voice.  I rise to speak on behalf of Beau Biden. He never spoke as much as any other Member of this body. His first and most important purpose in public life was Ada Maria, a plan for my then-2-year-old son's future. He was a devoted, deeply caring public servant for the people of Virginia, and all the people of the Commonwealth.

Now we have to focus not only on the science and the technology but to find those things that can take people to a place that people have not gone before and to make them into something that can turn the world into something that will make our country proud and that will allow us to build on what has been going on since the start of the Energy Department. We want to tell the American people the same message, no matter where you come from and what you believe, that what this country needs is not a repeat of the problems that surrounded the Manhattan Project but a different approach, a different approach. And we want to show them the kind of environment that created such remarkable scientists as Albert Einstein and Theodore Roosevelt.

Mr. President, my home State of Oregon has long been known for being innovative in a variety of important public policy areas. The Oregon Health Authority is one example of such a successful example. The Oregon Health Authority is a public health agency within the State government of Oregon that focuses on medical research in Oregon. The county is also committed to developing sound health care policy to make Oregon the most livable State in the country. The Oregon Health Authority is providing the necessary funds to achieve this goal and is making progress in this area of crime prevention.  I want to take a moment to thank the Oregon Health Authority for their efforts in criminal justice prevention and offender screening. Oregonians who watch their citizens are much more likely to report crimes to police. This puts them at an advantage when they are getting a warrant for arrest. It ensures that they know they have the opportunity to get that warrant.  But even more important, Oregon's law enforcement officers

Mr. President, as Republicans and Democrats debate the best way to reform health care, Americans are increasingly concerned about the price tag and about who will pay the bill if we fail to enact reform proposals now or make changes later. This is especially true as Republicans continue to press the Senate to move forward with the legislation that would reform health care today. The plans are simple, direct, and need no more than a few minutes to make.  Let me give an example. Last fall the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee undertook a project on congressional districts in each State. In each of the 12 districts where House Republicans control Congress, the committee went to work on reforming Medicare reimbursement to doctors who work in our districts. The staff worked to determine which House districts were representative of all medical offices in the country. They decided to concentrate on the 10 most medically underserved districts in the country to be represented by seven House Members. The staff talked

Mr. Speaker, I came here to the House floor to discuss the unfunded mandates question. But a much more important question is before this body. I ask this body to do the people's work for them when it comes to the unfunded mandate issue before us today.  This week Speaker Gingrich and others want to give the wealthy 2 more years to write a tax cut that will give every child a tax break that will not add one penny to the Federal deficit. But I note the days of this particular rule that do not allow for debate on the floor of the House on any tax cuts that would result from any tax increase.  Here in the House of Representatives that is wrong. Let us do the people's work and see that every child has a tax break at a time when the deficit is too high to pay for it.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Lemanuel ``Lee'' Jones, who passed away on the 23rd of April after many years of remarkable service to the people of the 11th Congressional District of New York. Lee was a graduate of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1951 and earned a bachelor of arts in October of 1961 and a master of arts in January 1962 in political science in June of 1964 from Columbia University in New York City after 2 years in the April '62 Presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater.  In Congress Lee held many roles as a dedicated public servant and joined the Veterans Committee in 1959 and served with honor from 1964 until 1964, when he was elected to the House of Representatives. During his four terms in Congress, Lee championed a variety of key initiatives such as improving housing for the elderly and programs for veterans and the needy. It was there that Lee became the first African American Congressman from New York City to represent Harlem, and his

Under this bill, it would have enacted a provision that would allow courts to hear arguments in administrative proceedings regarding the proposed legislation in the civil action of a Federal employee in connection with the appropriation or any authorization bill or resolution that the Congress passed under this act. Any court that would vote in favor of the Department of Education's proposed interpretation of or amendments to this act would have the ability to review the legislative intent and the legislative provisions to determine whether those changes are constitutional.

Mr. President, just very briefly, one of the biggest fights we have had about this bill--and make no mistake, it has been a fight--is about the balanced budget amendment and about how to get at it and not how to defeat it. We will get this right this time and not be able to have the Senator from Texas say that he wants to have a 50-50 split vote and we are not going to get it right this time when it is going to be law in the United States. I do not think so. He has not come up with a clean amendment to make it in order, and that is why I think we are having a lot of discussion here.  The balanced budget amendment has been controversial. Some times I have heard people say that there is no way we can balance the budget. Well, you can call it a pork-barrel thing, but the number of pork-barrel projects the Senators are proposing--

I voted against the President's stimulus package and urged Speaker Pelosi to work on legislation that would have made the financial system much more stable and less reliant on risk-taking individuals and institutions. I remain committed to that approach that has been so effective in getting us out of this financial crisis without frozen Main Street, which has meant business for all Americans and helped generate hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Since then, the economy has recovered substantially, creating nearly 6 million new jobs.

The question is, are these amendments going to be voted on in a bipartisan fashion because there is some recess of Members on both sides of the aisle. I believe those that are not going to be voted on have a process in place so we can get this done before there is any kind of recess and, as a result, we will get it done.

The Department of Defense now has the highest department of national intelligence in the world and the California Democratic Congress is calling for a top-to-bottom review of what we have done since the Persian Gulf war.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. Every day banks assume enormous risks in order to maintain our economy and allow millions of Americans access to credit. This bill is a good first step in addressing the financial institutions that we have all become so much more familiar with over the last several years due to increased banking competition and the coming of the 21st century economic and financial system. As we saw in recent days with the rise of the FDIC and the SEC, during times of financial stress the amount of people employed by the credit reporting and personal finance industries can quickly shrink. This bill will help stabilize financial markets by allowing small and emerging firms to challenge the big banks and credit unions with the onerous fees they impose on small businesses and consumers.  The legislation I have introduced is designed to protect American consumers from unscrupulous finance providers. Many financial institutions, such as savings and loan banks,

I consider that a good thing, because I consider that I think all of us can agree on how to go about fixing the problem of runaway Federal spending.

The current Federal judiciary is housed in 11 different locations across the Nation. These judges can be found in the District of Columbia, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.

What a good man he was, Mr. Speaker. What a friend, what a gentleman, what a servant. James Jarrell Pickle was born on October 11, 1919, in Durham, Tennessee. He served his country in the Army during World War I and was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action. He married his high school sweetheart in Texas in 1933 and he was raised in Greenville and began his career in business as a young man in Greenville. His first major international construction firm, Blanchard and Wells and Coach, was founded in 1945 by his mother and father.  James' commitment to his family was second to none.

Mr. Speaker, fixing our Nation's crumbling infrastructure to boost the economy and increase transportation safety should not be a partisan issue; yet Republicans in Congress want to change the way the Nation does business on the highway trust fund in this Congress, something that is being fought for by Speaker Gingrich and his Republican allies.  Now we are learning that the House Republican budget will immediately raise our Nation's gas tax by $1.98 a gallon--a hike that will make highway repairs and long-distance travel less reliable and more expensive, costing American families, all Americans, more money.  This isn't fair, it is not right. Transportation is a critical element of our economic and homeland security--not something that should be done just because Republicans are in the majority. When you change the system, it hurts the small businesses that make up that system, it hurts the freight railroads and the highway construction industry that build the road system and haul the goods

That amendment was accepted by both the authorizing and the Corps of Engineers. We did the same thing in the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill last year.  For good reason, we did not use that language as there is nothing to prevent it from happening here in the Energy and Water appropriations bill. That includes, of course, the funding of many important activities in the Department of the Interior, including energy and water, dams, roads, and streams.

I would not oppose such a move, Mr. Speaker, in the circumstances of the Korean war, but it should never be used as a pretext to engage in trade practices that are fundamentally inconsistent with our values and our interests.

So we are helping the Mexican Government to secure a border, and the commanders who are there on the border want to get to work and all of these things that we are doing with the Mexican people in our own homeland to the benefit of the entire community here, which we find a lot of people don't know.

Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to the remarks of my democratic colleague on the state of the judicial nominations process. We have before us a rule today that the Senate will not take any more action on any judicial nominee until after the Democratic leader and I have discussed our differences over those vacancies on Friday afternoon. I thank him for those comments, as we look ahead to conference and to any action on those judicial nominees that we are going to consider during that time. I would briefly respond by saying that I think the nature of the Republican majority is such that we have to make changes. I believe the rules should allow for meaningful debate on nominees. We can't continue on the route that we have gotten on numerous nominees for so many years.  Now, Senator Leahy has been the lead Republican negotiator on this--whether we will even move to vote on his nomination or not--for a long time, as I indicated. I

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment to repeal the tobacco tax giveaway. For years, the tobacco industry has denied the health consequences of its harmful products by misleading Americans to believe that they are safe and effective alternatives to cigarettes. Truth be told, the truth is that for decades the American public has been fed up with this deceptive and deceptive business. But now the truth is that the American people have a right to know the truth and we in Congress have a right to know the truth. We are all entitled to know the Bible and to know the truth. That is why this amendment is so important.  Mr. Chairman, as I indicated before, this amendment is essentially a sense-of-the-Congress amendment that I introduced earlier this year. This amendment prohibits the Federal Government from taking actions that would result in the extension or the establishment of an emergency tobacco tax giveaway program.

Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the 25th anniversary of what can only be described as a truly outstanding congressional success story. On July 4, 1986 Congress approved the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to bring Federal funds to the States to address the problem of our Federal fiscal mess. This historic bill brought the Page S 14102]]Federal Government into the lives of the American people through the story of what we do when, as in the case of our Federal fiscal problems, we do not face them alone. In the face of that seemingly insurmountable difficulty, Congress did what few are able to do--put politics aside and acted to solve our problem.  H.R. 1905 was the culmination of Congress's tireless efforts to enact the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It was a time to reverse fiscal practices that failed the economy and give the States back the power to control their own budgets. It

Mr. President, Senator Exon's amendment to restore $15 billion in agricultural spending is a step in the right direction for rural America. It is a step forward to combat the last ditch budget cut to our Nation's farm programs that comes at the very time when we are facing fiscal crisis and cuts to agricultural programs have been decimated in the 1990's. Unfortunately, Senator Exon's amendment would not be able to adequately address the largest cuts made to the Federal budget in this decade, where over $100 billion have been slashed from agriculture spending and only $7 billion from disaster assistance.  We have learned that the bailout of the Mexican peso, all in the name of a rescue of farmers, did not work.

Mr. President, the Framers of the Constitution gave the executive branch of our Government authority to negotiate treaties. But they also intended for the Senate's role to be advisory and that it serve as an independent branch of government. The Senate also has that role in the Federal Judiciary system.  President Harry Truman, in an effort to fulfill the Senate's role of being an independent branch, appointed a subcommittee on the floor of the House of Representatives to serve as a clearinghouse of legislative nominees. The House Judiciary Committee then convened a hearing on that nomination and that hearing was conducted by Senator James A. Moynihan and Senator Frank Schaeffer. As a result, on July 20, 1948, Congress formally approved the nomination of Floyd Abrams to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where Judge Abrams had been nominated to be a U.S. district judge.

I think we have all seen enough of this kind of thing to know that we need to put some money in to this great job to get these jobs going again so we can have more of them for our own people and so we can do something to get our economy going again so that when we get this wrong we can learn from it. We can try it again and make it right.  This provision in H.R. 5539 is another mischaracterization, a partisan bill designed to gain a political advantage. One cannot justify this if they want to make any good points, so we should leave it alone. What it is really about is voting on a flawed piece of legislation.  I spoke to a professor this morning who was very upset that there are a

In listening to the gentleman from Illinois, I keep hearing that he wants Puerto Rico to become independent, that he sees Puerto Rico as a small island without any people. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think it is fair to say that our citizens in Puerto Rico are not part of independent status nor should we question the status of this small island. But it does give me great pleasure to talk about the future of education that is proposed by Amendment 44. As I have been chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in Congress for the last 14 years, I had the opportunity to serve on the board of trustees of the University of Puerto Rico, and I know that education is critical to the future of all of Puerto Rico, not only its economic growth. Puerto Rico is a special place. It is the place where those born of Puerto Rican descent are raised and educated, and it is one of the most bilingual areas of the United States.

Mr. Speaker, the level of Medicare and Medicaid cuts would gut health care for the elderly and the poor leading to rationing of health care services by the Medicare and Medicaid cuts, so that every year some will pay more for health care than others.

Instead of permitting States to opt out of the plan of action mandated under the bill to become the primary consumers of energy from the Outer Continental Shelf, Congress should have the power to control energy development in the coastal waters of the United States of America and put the Chairman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in charge of policies for the domestic use of energy in the coastal waters.  The Chairman should not be in charge of energy development in our coastal waters. He should be in charge of oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf in our coastal waters.

Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today reauthorizes and even extends the Military Equal Access to Army Retirement Home Program and the Home Loan Program, which includes both military and nonmilitary spouses and children of military personnel. This important legislation will foster and make permanent a partnership between Army Corps of Engineer Sergeant Henry Dallecna and his wife Diana, their two daughters, and their one son. This valuable legislation supports military spouses and children who have served their country on active duty or in the Reserves or Guard and veterans who have served on active duty or in the Reserves or Guard. And the partnership is an excellent example of how we can work together to combat posttraumatic stress disorder, which is a form of mental health that affects men and women in the military.

If there is any war, it is only because America is at war.  The previous speaker is correct. Saudi Arabia is at war in Lebanon. Hezbollah supports Hezbollah. There are no disagreements between Israel and Hezbollah, and we support Israel.  Madam Speaker, the Iranians are not uniting to avoid a war in Lebanon, they are uniting to avoid a war in Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, Hollywood may have the script for its next sports movie classic.

But Bob Miller wants a more open and democratic world in which real football players and coaches have a chance to compete for their playing time and their championships and the champions' backs, and if their coaches don't make it, they can't coach their team.  If Coach Miller really wants the NCAA to be fair and make it easier for people to enjoy football in our country, then he would hire like-minded members of the powerful, college basketball powerbrokers from around the world, and he could work on a national championship championship schedule.

The result is a well-crafted bill that would make our Federal programs work better for working Americans and benefit future generations.  This bill takes important steps to help small business through the reauthorization of the Small Business Act of 1958 and the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. It also meets Speaker Pelosi's commitment to hold corporations accountable for the loss of jobs and economic insecurity that the middle class feels as they struggle to balance their personal and business needs and feed their families.  The Small Business Jobs and Credit Act also goes after the problem of waste in the financial industry by revamping the definitions of the so-called junk bond. For too long, banks like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch, which got away with ripping off our taxpayers, knew how to play with the public debt and mismanaged them

The ethanol tax increase that the House of Representatives is considering will have a dramatic impact on rural areas of North Carolina in my district in northeastern North Carolina. Gasoline in the central part of my district in Bucks County is about $2.20 a gallon. This will translate into almost a $2,000 tax increase for each family in Bucks County.

What is so interesting and one of the most important parts of this bill is the family cap and how this administration decided that they wanted to give all children in this country an additional $1 million tax cut paid for by education. I think that should be just about academic.  In school schools around the country are receiving funding cut by the education increases that the school districts are requiring teachers and administrators to accept. Increasing enrollment at our schools means less funding for the schools that are currently doing very well. But the school districts are trying to make sure that their children get what they can because some areas of the country have the resources to do better than other areas in the country, and that is why the Republican budget cap continues to apply in this country.

However, in a few years these stocks have all but recovered and are beginning to recover again. Even so, fishermen must continue to move long distances to fishing in these areas to meet their fishing quotas. Current federal regulations make it very difficult to fish for striped bass on Congress Island and many other fishing areas along the Atlantic coast.  Fisheries experts on the United States Bureau of Ocean Energy Management say the current Federal management is not the only way to preserve striped bass stock on the Atlantic coast. Every State has permits for fishing in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as some permits for Alaska's coastal waters, but Congress needs to act in a comprehensive way to change Federal policy to protect striped bass on all of our coastal waters.  The American people need to know that a reliable, cost effective, comprehensive

Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight a crucial issue that is beginning to take center stage in the Medicare debate, and that is the fact that the cost of Medicare Part A will be going up because of the House bill in the year 2000. But the cost of Part B will continue to go down because the House bill will continue to increase the out-of-pocket for the Medicare part A issue. This one issue, the one that affects the part A beneficiaries, will not go away, and that means that Medicare will be paying more out-of-pocket for the portion of part B Medicare that we are getting from the IRS.  Mr. Speaker, this has been talked about very prominently in the Nation's Capital as we begin to debate the welfare bill and whether or not the 1-percent tax on Social Security will have to go away. But at the end of the day what is important is not the welfare bill

Mr. President, today I am introducing the United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act, which is cosponsored by Senators Bingaman and Landrieu. This bill will help foster Israel's energy and industry development throughout the United States and ensure the well-being of the citizens of the State of Israel. I thank Senators Bingaman and Landrieu for their leadership in this regard and for championing this important legislation.  While the United States and Israel have been friends for more than 50 years, the energy resources of the renewable electric grid of the United States have, in recent years, become increasingly a target of international terrorism. Unfortunately, Israeli-American cooperation in the areas of renewable, alternative, and alternative fuels remains at an all-time low. Last year alone, the energy sector accounted for $1.2 billion in U.S. direct and indirect spending. It is true that in 2017, Israel decided to remove 5,000 megawatts from its national grid due

Mr. President, I recently became a co-sponsor of S. 295, the Teamwork for Employers and Management Act, a bill that is scheduled for markup today by the Commerce Committee. The Commerce Committee will mark up this legislation today. I would like to take the opportunity to respond to some of the major concerns raised by the business community regarding the role of small business in our Nation's workforce.  It should come as no surprise that with this teamwork-focused bill comes considerable concern from the business community. These concerns stem from legislation originally passed by the U.S. Congress to expand incentives for employees to participate in employer-sponsored employee stock ownership plans. The bill also creates opportunities to pool resources and allow employer-operated employee stock ownership plans to become more innovative. These measures will ultimately help more small employers and their employees become more successful.  I would like to review how this legislation will do more to expand employee ownership by giving small businesses the opportunity to put

Mr. Speaker, the reviews are starting to come in on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's health care reform proposal, and those reviews are pretty serious. In an August 3 Los Angeles Times article on Nancy Pelosi health care plan, the report stated that the American people are starting to suspect that she is either lying about her plans to extend health care coverage to 13 million uninsured children and the elderly and working people with no health insurance and no economic security, or she is covering the wealthy with legislation that benefits the rich but does little for the poor and the middle class.  Mr. Speaker, I must say it is nice to have a healthy debate on health care reform today. At long last, our Nation's partisan leaders have finally decided to focus on health care reform, a problem that demands a solution. But, it is time to recognize the problems of the American people and move forward to pass health care reform so we can provide real security and economic security for

I thank the gentleman for yielding. I understand his concern.

So I think the issue in terms of that is a very important one.  I want to reiterate, but I understand that the gentleman has other colleagues who would like to be heard on this. So I yield

Mr. Speaker I am very aware of it, and for that reason it becomes meaningless. So the key here is a reconciliation bill that contains all provisions of the Tax Code that are set to expire, that is completely unrelated to that business that we are talking about now. We can ignore that tax cut provision that stays in that particular tax cut provision for over the next 5 years and then we can deal with the defense issue.  If this tax cut provision and all of the rest of this moratorium language is enacted, then there will be no increase in taxes on people making $150,000 and up for the next 5 years. That means mining companies will have an additional $17 million or $18 million for tax reasons, or maybe $8 million. Other industries--I believe it is agriculture--will have an additional $1 million or $2 million of tax relief.  This is a trade bill. This is a voluntary program that

Madam President, I wish to thank the Chair and my colleague from Georgia who understood and presented so effectively the impact on our community banks and the economy. I thank him for his work in bringing this matter to our attention and for his understanding of the importance of the $4 billion that we understand is needed for the development of the mainframe and the other necessary equipment that will make this possible. We appreciate the hard work of the Senator from Georgia in that regard and believe we have always had his help and his understanding and the understanding of the needs of our community banks that was understood and anticipated and all the support that is essential to the success of the mainframe bank at a time when it is at the kind of historical advantage to do so.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1335 would extend the deadline for construction of a 20 megawatt solar project in my district that will power much of downtown San Diego for years to come by closing a 2-year project that was initially to begin in September 2007 and in the September of 2004 with the city of San Diego agreeing to pay the startup costs of the wind farm and a monthly one-time charge.  By granting the deadline for construction of this project, the House is giving the Iowan's State, a neighbor of ours, an opportunity to participate in something that is very much of interest to me, the marketplace, and people throughout my district.  The Santa Fe Wind Farm was originally built in 2003 under a 1993 agreement that the city of San Diego signed with the renewable energy firm RSL Laboratories to establish a 20 megawatt wind farm in the city's downtown San Diego.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend that Chevron has stated that it could cut the cost of a $3 million legal defense by 50 percent and put it into other areas of its business and it would not do it if the State is not required to do it as it is here today in this bill to balance its budget without this one time funding. That is what is in the bill, not what was intended in the Clinton administration.  This is a bill that should have come to the floor a long time ago, a bipartisan bill that was intended to do what was left undone by the Clinton administration, which is to balance the Federal budget and to provide access to a legal defense fund that has been shut off for many years and for decades. That is what this bill would accomplish. It is not about more money. It is not about more protection of the rights of citizens,

I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), who has a strong interest in this issue related to Taiwan's status in the Asian continent and its respect for the Taiwan policy of the United States. And if we can just get this through the House this week, we can reduce the amount of time that we are spending on this bill if it would reduce the measure of the gap that exists between the President's position and the position of the Congress.  Mr. ROYCE. I thank the gentleman.  I am going to rise in support of the resolution and, also, rise in opposition to this misguided policy.  Let me begin by acknowledging my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Israel), and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Chairman, I have known this gentleman and his colleague for nearly a decade. This is a very difficult issue to debate,

I am reminded of a friend of mine, when I was the Secretary of State in Missouri, who was the leader, the Democratic leader in our State government for the last 30 years, who was the predecessor of the current Secretary of State in Missouri, the senior Senator from the State of Missouri who had the committee that raised our standard of living, that made people live better when they did work, that reminded me of a man named Ernest Powell who was my friend. I remember fondly his work in my State government back then, in the Governor's mansion, and what an enormous task it was for him to pass school lunches that in the dark of night to no one could see and to pay people decent wages.  When I became the Secretary of State, he came and spent 3 weeks there as one of the Senators on the Federal advisory committee with the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Domenici, on the international aspects

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to my friend from New York (Mr. Israel). Mr. ISRAEL. I thank my friend from Washington for the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the conference report on the United States-Israel Security Cooperation Treaty. I would also like to thank Chairman Royce and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for including some important provisions to the conference report and meeting the needs of our two countries in the past.  First of all, the title of this bill is the ``United States and the Middle East peace side of the bargain.'' Our friend Israel deserves much credit for the pragmatic compromises that it has made with the United States in the past in the manner in which it has handled the peace process, and it deserves much credit for its cooperation with the administration and its ability to work out important bilateral and multilateral issues in a fair and prompt manner. I am happy to see the role

Mr. Speaker, I simply want to respond to one theme that we have heard here in the last 20 minutes or so. We have heard that we must not cut spending in this country. How do you explain the debt that we now have with the United Nations and the World Bank that we are still $500 million a month over the next 3 years and the Members of the other body that are saying we will not do anything to bring down the debt limit when we are talking to the administration on how we meet that obligation to balance this budget for our children and our children to come forward with it and do it today but not to take this country to the potential for a huge job to respond to what is happening here in Washington?  I know the gentleman has spent time talking about the program that is going to pay off the Nation's debts and was presented with an extraordinary assignment as a Member of the majority where we were asked to implement what

I am talking about the heart and soul of welfare policy; I am not talking about the Senator's heart. Let me go on, OK? Mr. President, I would like to get back to the heart of this policy because if we can have a real difference of opinion on this one that it should have that it should have a chance to be passed here by the Congress because if it had not had that chance to be put together, we would not be debating it now. We could not have a question for a minimum wage. If there had been a referendum on minimum wage in this country, we would have a chance to hear it voted on. We could not have a referendum on raising the minimum wage in this country. We could not have a referendum on term limits in this country.  But in this bill it is there for the first time. It does not violate the Constitution of the United States or the laws that we have passed. It
