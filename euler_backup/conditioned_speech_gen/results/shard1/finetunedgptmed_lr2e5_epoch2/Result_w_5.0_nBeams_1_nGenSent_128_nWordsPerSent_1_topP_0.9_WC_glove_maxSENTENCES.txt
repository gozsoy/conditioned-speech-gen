There has been some prior motion which was very strongly opposed by the majority of the Members of this House, and it is not clear that they now intend to do the very same thing. The other point that the gentleman made was that they are doing it without having any discussion on the floor. I

<|endoftext|>Republicans keep adding to the GOP tax bill. After last week's vote on the Senate version of their so-called Family Friendly Tax Cut Act, Republicans have only passed two bill that will benefit American families today and in the future. Both were passed in the wake of two failed tax cuts that made only modest improvements to the national economy and that failed to extend the economic recovery that they were promised so much. The Senate bill did not go far enough to make the tax cuts permanent and to extend the benefits for hardworking middle-class families. So instead of passing a bill that will truly benefit the people of this country, Republicans are leaving open

This year, we would have expected the Senate to be in the majority in both matters to get the energy and development money needed to implement these projects. But I have been troubled by some of the arguments being made against them that I think are unfair to the American public.

The Congress will have a long legislative season this year, and the debate will probably continue well into the spring. But energy prices continue to spiral out of control, just as they have done before, and we will continue to see record profits and record profits on the backs of our working families and small businesses in this country.

This bill will create a new health insurance exchange for the American people and set the stage for the same kind of exchange to be set up for the United States of America in the year 2010. These changes will ensure that all Americans who currently have health insurance will have access to it in the year 2006 as well as the year 2008.

Mr. Speaker, the House will not vote until we pass an extension of unemployment benefits for Americans without any guarantee of continuation, however important that is as it is important that we protect the ability for those Americans that are suffering but still very likely to be able to find work to get that job if they can find it. That is why we are here today to consider legislation that will give us a guarantee that this Nation will never again give the definition of jobless in any other way except for the fact that we are in an economic recession where we have an unemployment rate that is now well over 10 percent and if we have a number of small businesses that are

That is an undeniable fact. Yet after nearly a decade in Iraq, we have not done enough to act to stop the killing that has taken place there and to make sure that the reconstruction of Iraq will not continue unless Congress acts now to send a strong message to the Iraqi government that we will not support this policy of committing a new war on their part

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute to say that I strongly oppose the amendment that is offered by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Sam Johnson]. It says that when there is a threat to safety of the taxpayer, Federal funds can be used to assist local law enforcement agencies in dealing with those threats, but, unfortunately, it has been the practice to rely on purely State or local discretionary funding from the very beginning. This is the practice that has resulted in the reduction in the number of State grants to law enforcement in this country. And I think it is irresponsible. It is an open door for States to provide assistance for law enforcement assistance and training
