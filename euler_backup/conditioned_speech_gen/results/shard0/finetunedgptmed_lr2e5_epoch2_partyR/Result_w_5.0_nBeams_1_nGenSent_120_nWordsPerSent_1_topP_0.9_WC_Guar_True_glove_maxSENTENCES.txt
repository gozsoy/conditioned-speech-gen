So let's pass legislation that would put a limit on how much money we will give to the Treasury to go spend on the bureaucracy and on purchasing equipment. That is

The championship in the 2015 World Cup in Canada was one of the highest scoring games in recent history. The USWNT conceded four goals in the final 27 minutes of play. Two goals went in; and after a penalty kick, the USWNT would go on to claim victory

Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for yielding me this time and for his hard work and good amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this is not a balanced bill because it increases infrastructure spending. This bill would decrease infrastructure spending by almost $5 billion over 10 years. That is a reasonable, straightforward, and fair figure, because when you combine highway, transit, and maritime funding, you end up with a whole lot of infrastructure spending.  There is a difference between going up in the end of a decade and slowing down to make sure we have priorities in our community and in our cities and in

This Speaker has been clear on this subject for some time now and many of my colleagues have heard his passionate and well-informed comments on the subject from our Rules Committee and from the Joint Committee on Taxation on that subject.

The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care and $4 billion for National Museum of African American History and Culture. The committee leadership intended the additional funding to help provide a full budget for veterans' health care. Unfortunately, the Democrats on the committee rejected the Republican amendment to include $1.8 billion to help provide veterans health care on GOP plan.  The Veterans' Caucus offered a second amendment with $58 million to help provide services and equipment for military families. The amendment also omitted funds for the White House Tribal Center and the U.S. Holocaust Museum. These museums should not be left out of this bill and must be included in the

It is going to be important to fund our military as they are trying to make a statement after months and months of hard work in trying to make these personnel officers and their families who serve in the military truly aware of the possible loss of their officer.  They are going to be real concerned, as my colleague from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] stated, about the financial consequences of a full-blown financial crisis in the United States for our military.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need to address the crisis of uninsured children. And it is important to note that this crisis and these statistics are not new. In rural areas, rural health care providers have reported health care costs for children going up by nearly 60 percent for years now. Those costs are higher than agriculture-related costs in many cases and even higher for rural families, loans and work.  That is why I am introducing the Family Financial Responsibility Act which is meant to provide nutrition assistance to families and communities that may be facing crisis, increased family health care costs as a result of our unemployment

Without strong U.S. laws to protect their jobs and to provide American companies with the certainty that they need to operate in this competitive international market, U.S. businesses face more uncertainty and

Mr. Chairman, I want to say that the amendment makes much more technical changes to the bill and is intended to make the problems associated with Federal business agencies more manageable.  I would like to point out a couple of points. First, the amendment provides $100 million to cover only the costs of any reformulation of regulatory agencies with an overall impact of $1 billion, and I think that certainly goes a long way toward leveling the playing field.  I would point out that the most significant economic analysis of the economy conducted to date, which was done by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, pointed to $400 million

But, Mr. President, I have to say as leader, it has been time well spent. I hope the attention of the American people and Members of this body who will cast votes on it this week are also. This budget goes to what I consider to be fundamental to the

Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is also in the nature of a substitute which is the same as the one that has been just agreed to by the majority and the minority of the Senate with the City of Memphis coming here and saying, yes, this is our home, we need some of the money. The question here is, does the Montezuma's amendment offer sufficient amount to help to build new high-rise housing to keep Memphis affordable?  This amendment has two parts. The first is to require the city of Memphis to meet standards of affordable housing for low-income elderly people,

Madam Speaker, this House would have you believe that the Obama administration and some of its right-wing allies back up their promise to end the so-called `` gag rule'' with actual legislation. But the administration has done what its own own press reports have said it cannot and it will continue to put its commitment to be legislated in the next Congress in question.  Last month, the administration was criticized by House Republicans for not providing up on health care reform. It is also critical to recognize that with most of the key administration officials and government entities leaving the administration, the administration, despite its continued promise,

First, some of the increases over the last few years have been huge increases in spending increases. Second, doubling of the Federal budget has happened. It seems to be all too often that it is more important to think about the spending than to think about the dollars.  The administration has said they have reformed the education system. The President said the education system is improving, but what has happened is more spending,

It is to make it clear that the subcommittee has jurisdiction over the first phase of the Marine Mammal Protection Program which is over the North Atlantic right off the coast of New York and Florida. The next phase would be over the Caribbean and the Cape. These are areas that both the trademarking laws of the United States and the ICC regulations of the United States deem to be fisheries. It is a very good and very successful program in that it provides a solution to the issue of that permanent presence of a species in a protected area, whether they be marine

Mr. Speaker, the second issue to come up when discussing the issue of abortion is this one of the most important public health issues that Congress should address. Earlier this year, a new group called No More Names released an annual list of the world's leading forces of global health organizations working against abortion. This is by no means the first time this organization has been called upon to support Secretary Duncan's stance on abortion. In fact, the first such statement was issued in 2001 when Secretary Duncan said that ``I don't believe it is politically correct to talk about abortion in the United States of America.''  In fact,

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the American Energy Act and the way it would close high gasoline prices.  After all, higher fuel prices have been hitting the American economy. We all know this is a great thing, but we also know we cannot continue with our current path of spiraling prices on our Nation's domestic petroleum products.  So why are we doing this to our gasoline supply?  Not only does the American Petroleum Institute report, and as I have said before, the President recently gave a speech claiming that lower gasoline prices are actually causing Americans to save. If that is the case,

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment and urge its immediate adoption. This amendment will help to reduce America's ongoing financial crisis by increasing the efficiency and cost of the Federal Government in the plan for new and proposed construction. By reducing the taxes that are imposed on private construction and by cutting the loss to the taxpayers, we are doing what we should be doing: relieving our country of unnecessary, costly and duplicative government spending.  Under the budget resolution, the committee would cap outlay and increased the official budget by $125 million, while slowing the level of deficit funding from 2.5 to

Mr. President, the bill that is before us this morning has two provisions that will be of concern to those who have followed the Senate this year, and also to those that are not. We will be providing $60 million for California in State sales tax relief for 2007 because the State of California permits State sales taxes to be exempt from Federal income taxes for an additional 3 years in a row. Illinois provides a 4-year grace period for individuals who are married filing jointly to bring home their jointly paid taxes.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Respect for Property Act of 1995, which I have introduced with my good friend and colleague from Georgia, the distinguished Senator from Georgia and our voice and friend from the great State of Georgia, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina.

The Federal Government, along with the Government through the courts cleared away the statutory foundation for eminent domain.

Mr. Speaker, in 1970, President Nixon submitted for the President's desk an amendment to the Economic Security Act which would have declared that American businesses are exempt from the foreign capital control laws of other countries. In other words, gambling and gambling casinos would be subject to the same rules and regulations as other businesses that could be subject to these restrictions in other countries. Thus we have many communities in my district that will no longer have access to the weapons and ammunition they use to fight the war on drugs.  We are also concerned about the fact that foreign firms continue to lobby to enhance domestic job creation. The same arguments

We want the programs to be sustainable. I would much rather cut some spending on Medicaid and leave them there, so

Mr. Speaker, the Exon-Welch alternative to ObamaCare was to fail to sign up people who needed help and to let them go to the Exon-Welch alternative to join the already-insured and their access to quality health care. Instead, the Democratic Party chose a seemingly endless parade of pleasure party gimmicks and big government mandates.  Democrats used to practice individual responsibility for tribes, towns, and individuals. When these groups failed to comply, the tribes were singled out to be hit with mandates and tortures.

We do not need to pass more taxes on people in this country that they do not have to pay themselves because they are going to be able to pay themselves when they do have personal responsibility.  That is not a plan to have people in this country, the people who are in the program, go to these new Federal buildings because we do not have enough doctors to go in and see them. That is not going to happen. So I urge

Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to reform the way we spend spending government money.

Indeed, the passage of the Women's History Month resolution is a reminder that every generation of Americans is forging a better future.  Even our most conservative Representatives today recognize

<|endoftext|>I know the Democrats want to say the most important thing about this new leadership is that it will eliminate many of the restrictions on the number of new staff they are willing to put on the Democratic Members of Congress and then run the new new new York office up with plenty of staff and staff and staff. But I think the most important thing, the Senator from Massachusetts certainly made that point.  It is not my intent in my comments to say they will try to keep these standards of performance.

Mr. Speaker, today the National Security Council released their assessment of the State of the Union address. It is important to focus on the President and the State of the Union because that control of the debate is so important. The President needs a strong State of the Union Message to set America and the world on a better track and to help California and the rest of America build their sovereign military bases by the year 2002. That support should be no objection to any candidate for the office of the President.  The President needs a strong State of the Union Message to give his message to the Congress and to the American people,

Mr. President, I will be very brief because I know there are a lot of things going on today in this House that need to be worked out and reported to the Senate and reported to the President. The Democrats are going to be here until all these things are worked out and passed in Hawaii, and they are going to spend all afternoon talking about other things. That is one of the reasons I was here earlier today.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and I want to say that I always knew this man was a man of his word when he came to Congress when he had just come back from 11 missed votes on rollcall votes in which he had volunteered to vote. He said that he was about to vote yes on Nay. So I have to say I am very sorry to miss the vote.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I want to address the Senator from Iowa a little bit more on the subcommittee bill on homeland security because the whole matter of homeland security comes to mind because of the terrible act we saw in the Oklahoma City bombing and all the other acts of violence on the Homeland in recent years. Indians, Aboriginals, people of other faiths, have to look a little bit more critically at that, and we are working on it.

Mr. Speaker, this vote is not about the national defense of the United States of America or its citizens. This vote is about whether or not the Federal Government will continue to spend money to fund projects that already exist.  When the President announced his fiscal year 1996 budget, he promised spending cuts of at least $60 billion. Yet in the last 30 days, we've heard that the Clinton budget actually increases discretionary spending by at least $70 billion--a move which would save the United States Department of Defense $750 million.
