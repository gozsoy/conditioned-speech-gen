<|endoftext|>Republican plans to repeal the health care law are threatening to derail this year's effort to provide health care to everyone who has health insurance in America. It will end up harming millions of hardworking Americans to force them into the government-run system they have every right to be in.  I know because I helped help pass a bipartisan bill that has been working well in my home State of New York for years now. That bill was one of two successful pieces of health care legislation that New York needs to continue to have a state-run program for the health of our children and their parents and the sick and the frail and the disabled to bring

Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that there is an artificial matter here that some believe might prevent this bill from ever being brought to the floor because they believe that is a small number of hard-working American taxpayers who get a tax break by giving the rate of those tax cuts to large corporations. So this bill is nothing more than a huge tax increase on a small percentage of working Americans in America.  I want to read a single tax increase that would be thrown in this bill from my own State of Minnesota that I think points out the magnitude of this tax increase.

Mr. President, the time has come for us to take a vote on the PATRIOT Act today. My view is the PATRIOT Act is unworkable, that it would slow the Nation down and hinder the Government from carrying out its vital and necessary authorities in protecting the country against both international terrorism and the taking of its citizens without due process of law or due process of law enforcement. The President of the United States has issued the clearest of warnings to the Congress that the authorities granted in the PATRIOT Act will not be used as the most appropriate law enforcement tool because of the way it was written and because it did not allow for

The Senate bill will prohibit the creation of a new Federal student loan program while the House Democratic proposal will simply allow current and former students to remain in the current Sallie Mae and TPA student loan programs without being prohibited from working towards making loans while they are in the program.  I have been a strong advocate of making sure that the student loan programs work for all students.

But what he has not done in this whole process that has been going on for the past several months is have done what the people think ought to be done when it comes to reform of the welfare program in America and this Republican Party should have done in the last few months in all this last-minute Congress that they were

On June 22, 1988, Amtrak was on track to begin service for the Northern States in the fall of 1988. Unfortunately, only eight of the 44 train cars carrying Union Pacific employees were on time at the time of the derailment. For these seven victims, their families were left devastated in their years of hard work to provide the most improved passenger service in the Nation's history. President Reagan and Congress were and remain in our thoughts today and those of all those affected in their time of loss.

The recovery and reinvestment programs have been the cornerstones of economic growth in this country since 2001 and they are very essential to helping our country recover from this recession. The increase in investments in the Recovery and Reinvestment Act has helped spur the creation of 2.7 million jobs over the past year alone, the vast majority of which have been in sectors that had long since taken the fall for the downturn. In fact, the Recovery and Reinvestment Act is the most significant economic stimulus legislation passed by Congress in my lifetime.

The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care and increase funding for non-VA health care programs by $100 million. The Republican amendment that the Rules Committee rejected was offered by the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Waters], a member of the subcommittee I chair. It would have cut the $1.8 billion and funded non-VA health care programs and disability programs at a level that the budget resolution calls for by roughly $100 million above the number requested by the President and about $100 million below the level we passed in the Senate.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Chairman Pomeroy and support of this measure as we move it along through the process.  The reason why this amendment is necessary, Mr. Chairman, is that the real problem confronting us is not us, the  [[Page H1675]] Congress, the liberals; it is we, the Americans, as we go about the business of running the most important human enterprise on the face of the Earth. We are trying to figure out in the post-cold-war world, after 2 decades of war, how we are going to reach the ability to compete and bring down our own

This legislation has been introduced by my colleague Congressman John Fleming of Louisiana and Representatives Jack Bergman and Bill Tauzin of Texas, and is supported by the National Marine Fisheries Service and other interested groups, including the American Fisheries Institute. This bill reauthorizes and makes other improvements in the coastal sea grant program that has helped so many American fishermen and other business owners in the Gulf of Mexico for more than a century.

Mr. Speaker, this legislation will support my efforts to ensure that Federal land owned by the Federal Government remains within State sovereignty. States rely on this authority to transfer federal land to the federal government in order to establish legislative, regulatory and economic self-sufficiency.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple and direct. It would repeal the President's proposed fiscal year 1994 budget request that would provide a $10 billion increase for the Civil Air Patrol at this time when Congress has already authorized funding for the Civil Air Patrol at $10.8 billion in fiscal year 1993 and at $12.4 billion in fiscal year 1994. The amendment would continue congressional action to fulfill our responsibility to provide for the increased national security requirements of the Civil Air Patrol which I support.

I have stated in the past my hope that there would be hearings and vote on this matter at least as soon as it is appropriate for that body to do that. But if it takes the Senator from Illinois a long time to find out the answer to this question, then I guess this is just not the best thing for our country in the immediate future.

Mr. President, the Federal courts have now ruled that a business may prohibit a group of its employees from paying for the insurance of a married woman who is earning between $20,000 and $50,000 a year. The decision is in the name of encouraging association between women and their employers. It may be of interest to many who were not aware of the health benefits program.  The association between women and their employers has several important issues which must be addressed. The first question is whether it is pro-life or pro-choice. Abortion is morally repugnant to many people, whether pro-choice or pro-life. What about employment

I think that is what is so valuable in this bill that we were able to get an overall increase of $23 billion over last year in the block grant program to take care of the things that the Senator from

Mr. Speaker, the Federal workers benefit that was approved by Congress and signed into law by President Clinton is still one that many have criticized as a one-size-fits-all program. Congress and President Clinton all claimed they were going to ``help the hardworking Federal workers'' get a better deal when they were in fact well short of helping the hardworking taxpayers and working Americans in the last two terms of this great Nation and I rise today in support of this legislation and want to thank the majority for this legislation and urge support for the bill as well.  The vast majority of Americans are not rich. Most do not need $10 million for housing

While the story is intriguing and it gets to the heart of the question on this plan, it also makes many important criticisms of the Clinton proposal and the way it is being brought to the floor today. The Wall Street Journal also notes that the Clinton administration proposal differs significantly from the alternative proposal put forth by Senator Kennedy and Senator Biden which is a $250 billion insurance plan that would guarantee health care coverage to all Americans as a matter of right and not a private decision that

That day of commemorations and observance comes at a very critical time in our Nation's history.

They want States to bear the burden of providing abortions for millions of women without regard to the health of their mothers and their health care needs.  However, House Republicans have said the legislation does not violate any Federal statute. Well, the rules of the House are very clear, and they say that the rule of the House prohibits the House from regulating any aspect of health insurance provided to American citizens, or public funds that support them, without consultation with the other body.

Mr. President, I rise to address my concern regarding the strength of the Appalachian Regional Commission [ARC] and its financing by the Federal Government. I share the concerns of many of my colleagues about the negative impact of the Federal Government funding Federal activities associated with the operation and maintenance of the ARC. The regional commission's annual operations deficit totaled $12 million last year, and its debt to the Federal Treasury was $34 million. That deficit and the costs it places on the Federal Treasury are staggering and it is imperative that we provide some relief for the ARC. I therefore support a continuing Federal operating and operating reserve fund that would allow an additional $2 billion for

Madam President, our Nation's families are being forced to live in fear and make difficult choices. They are being forced to buy health insurance without any benefit provided. They are being forced to pay thousands of dollars more per year in premiums or deductible for their health care they could save with their own money and with their own resources.  These are not only un-American choices for many families but also unfair to those who are elderly and disabled and are forced to provide health care for their families as their assets and to have it paid for with their own money and their own resources. Many families are suffering as a result of the rising cost of health care.

This son of Georgia's Second Congressional District is still a hero to those who knew him well and well to those who never met him.  His unusual heroism paid off on the 2nd of September when his company was informed of a rear-guard movement by the enemy on the western front.

His logic is we need to have more troops because we are a strong country, and now we need to use it because we are safer.

It is not that difficult to get along with the majority leader if you are the majority leader in this House or in the other House.

And I say to the editorial writer that ``even a visa ban does not stop an active agent of terrorism from visiting the United States and posing the potential threat of terrorism against the United States.''

Madam President, just for our colleagues to be on the same page we are not making this amendment a Democratic amendment. We are trying to amend it to the Republican amendment we have been proposing for many years and the last time we voted on this amendment was in 1996. The Republican amendment passed with 68 votes and supported by the majority of the Senate. It is not some petty way that we should fight back against the fair and just administration of justice which this administration is allowing to happen to its people in our country. It is not that that is a big deal and we should not deal with it.  What I want to do in this amendment is to

In January of this year the White House released its budget for 1994 that contained a dramatic increase in the corporate tax rate of 25 percent and a draconian increase in the child tax credit. The plan called for a 60-percent corporate tax rate and a 65-percent child tax credit to be available to 100 percent of the American people beginning in 1993 and to be extended to the first $250,000 of net worth.

But the anxiety and despair of Alzheimer's can make the connection between someone who loses his or her sense of self or how a loved one has gone before virtually impossible. It is a matter of knowing that their loved one is not alone, but that they may need your help and your help alone.  Today, I would like to

One of the very first acts of this Congress was to add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.  Unfortunately, as this Congress and the administration have continued to fight against anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, it seems that they have forgotten that their first response to this problem was to make it more difficult for the government to fight crime at all. Under the guise of fighting violent crime in our country, we have made it harder for the government to fight crime at all.

Madam Speaker, this week the American people are asking us to come together to fix the economy and cut spending so we can help those in need. We can do that with jobs and energy efficiency, all of which will help create millions of jobs and pay off our Nation's debt. But there is still more work to do.  We can do that by creating jobs now and keeping them here in America so we can help those in need by increasing pay and rewarding the hard work we need to do to move these economic policies forward.  One of the biggest job killers in this country right now is uncertainty. How are we going to get new things for

This important tribute is also particularly appropriate because I am chairman of the Senate International Relations Committee.
