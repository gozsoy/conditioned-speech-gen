Mr. Chairman, I just think it is important that we have to clearly understand this because if we do not understand this amendment and if we really believe that this is just a kind of a backroom deal because this is such a small amount that it would not have anything to do with insurance or anything else that we really do not need here, why is it that there are these people that are so concerned that they are not going to have this kind of fact known to the American people that has been reflected in this bill? It is because they do not believe that their information would come to light.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

But I understand his constraints and his temptation to offer his own waiver.  I want to point out one point of support that I think is very critical. At least a 5 percent deficit would not jeopardize the number of troops being deployed around the world.

Mr. President, Senator Cornyn and I introduced legislation, the Accident Insurance Reform Act, which addresses the increasing crisis that financial products pose to investors and consumers.  This legislation would require labeling of risks, products, and products services covered by financial products. It would require disclosures by financial products that products include warranties and liability of the products in question, GMOs, ``freeze,'' services or virtual channels. It would require disclosures by financial products of the liabilities or service activities of certain entities. It would also prohibit companies from making false claims about product benefits or risk.  I am deeply concerned about the rising financial crises that have plagued the Nation's financial

Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition of the rule for the VA/HUD Appropriations bill that shortchanges health care for our nation's veterans. The bill is $2.1 billion below the GOP House Budget Resolution and $3.3 billion below the veterans' consensus budget.  The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care services and education, even though veterans have the most acute care needs in our country, the highest rate of unemployment in our Nation's history, and this Republican bill also would take the largest cut in veterans' health care in the history of the Federal Government and the neediest veterans in our country in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich and corporate special interests rules.  This rule shows clearly that the Republican majority believes veterans are left behind by this Congress. They will not agree to any increase in veterans' health care in the veterans' budget.  Veterans deserve better and this Republican majority does not meet the veterans' health care needs.

We will need to be able to demonstrate to this body that we can work together to resolve those differences if we want determination for our constituencies. The reason I said that is we are here because of the principle of fairness that the amendment of the violation we are denying is unfair, and I think all of us, if we are truly interested in bringing our constituents to a point where there will not be further conflict, will come to the floor, show our ability

Mr. Speaker, over the last decade, we have witnessed great progress in the fight against global hunger. In my home State of New Mexico and around the world, there is widespread concern that hunger has overtaken poverty in hostile countries. Over a million people have been lifted out of poverty since 2001 amid a rise in the number of countries meeting the Millennium Development Goals that we have established over the last three decades. The United Nations has declared Israel as a significant success story. We are no longer at the point where we can't even feed one single child.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close this debate on this very important issue.  Mr. Speaker, what we have seen here is a President who wants to use this as a political football to get attention in this town. We have seen a President who says I will bemoan a bill that, frankly, this Congress is already passing; I will find a way to change it, but I can't do that until I do it in the form of a blanket amnesty for millions and millions of illegal immigrants.  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my colleagues a story. I was in South Dakota this weekend.

Mr. President, my amendment seeks to change the intent of the law to allow the Postal Service to provide free health care benefits to uninsured veterans for their care and treatment as long as that health care benefits are part of prescription drug coverage, not part of Medicare. The Postal Service currently operates under a nondiscriminatory risk-based payment and therefore offers its citizens at no cost a variety of medical services under a competitive bidding process. In general, this benefit is not provided to everyone, just to those who are eligible. A program which is carried out at no cost to taxpayers was never intended to benefit all veterans who are not currently eligible for this benefit.

In the Senate, the conference report passed by 87 to 11.  It's critically important that this House vote in favor of the agreement. Why? Because it increases American jobs and economic competitiveness, expands trade and investment, and it

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from Michigan and to some extent to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as well. I think we have tried to make it easier for him to bring bills to the floor for consideration. The first time that I recall in my experience as a new Member that our two sides of the aisle were able to bring to the helping hand of the House are bills where there was no debate or, to some degree, no debate for a period of time, and that is a good thing.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In the coming year, this program will be updated, and after the 10th of next year the CIA will be required to make an assessment, or the NSS will make an assessment, of whether they wish to share that information with the Department of Defense.

The first is that this nominee is the least qualified to be the next Secretary of the Senate by Senate Republicans. Congress passed legislation requiring congressional nominees to earn a grade from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The IRS released an analysis that concluded John Paul Stevens's grades were below those of the Senators who were nominated prior to 2000. The Senate adopted that measure without dissent.

Mr. President, this week President Bush announced that the United States will move ahead with military action in Iraq to provide force for the Iraqis to take over the country. He has directed that there be an official Commission to study the success of the counterinsurgency effort in Iraq and in both blood and treasure of our Armed Forces and what the necessary and appropriate response is to the numerous and growing problems at home in America and the University of Cincinnati. The President's announcement follows our action last month in Iraq to authorize air strikes on Iraq's ammunition depots, a move that allowed our troops to advance in the first hours of our invasion last March.
