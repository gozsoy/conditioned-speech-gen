Madam President Member Montana trillion.  Madam President, today we will be voting on the Republican budget. It is the Republican budget. I have voted for every Republican budget since I have been here. It is a budget that has a balanced budget in 7 years. It provides $900 billion in tax relief. It gives Medicare the freedom to negotiate. It gives a middle-class tax cut. It has $60 billion in Medicaid savings over 7 years. It provides $15 billion in education savings. It provides $60 billion in student loan savings over 7 years. It provides $1 billion in Pell grants over 7 years. It provides $10 billion

Mr. Chairman actingally ally Russia is a friend and ally. The Obama administration has consistently been willing to work with Russia to counter Russian aggression and their aggression against our ally Ukraine.  But the Obama administration has been, as a matter of fact, too eager to play Russian roulette with our ally Ukraine.  The Obama administration, Mr. Chairman, has encouraged Russia to act in the Russian Federation's interests, not our own. It has encouraged Russia to promote its regional interests and helped Russia pursue a failed invasion of Crimea.  We are talking about the Obama administration's policies that led to the invasion of Crimea.  In 2014, the Obama administration

These laws are called judiciaries, and they are composed of statutes and treaties.  A key feature of the Supreme Court's records is the publication of the opinions of the justices, which form the core of its authoritative record. Because the opinions are generally public and can be obtained in one or more languages, they are a critical part of the

Mr. President President legislation that I just passed with room to spare is the Marine Corps Appropriations Act of 1995. I would like to thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their help in putting this bill together.  This is a tough bill, but I believe it is a good bill. I have tried to include the Senate's version of a national sea grant program, known as the ``marine resources study'' and I hope to include it in the House version of the bill.  There is no question that the Marine Corps is a major force in the future of our country. In the next century, our military will require nearly 6,000 ships

Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill will reduce the deficit by $43 billion over the next 10 years. We have heard that term over and over again. This is not an increase in the deficit.

The legislation is a significant change in our relationship with the executive branch. It removes the President's authority to veto bills he signs and eliminates the need for the Senate to act on veto overrides.  For more than 200 years, Congress has operated under a provision that gave the President the power to issue the annual budget resolution.  But the Senate and the House of Representatives have never been allowed to override the President's veto.

Mr. President President, today I comment on the disputed vote in the House regarding a provision in the fiscal year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 1588. This provision, which is called the Conveyance of D.C.

A portion of the money that the D.C.
