The day began when members of the Stonewall Jackson Army Band were peacefully protesting the racial segregation in their area of the town of New York City. For their efforts, the band received a Federal $100 gift for the use of their facilities and honored their efforts by holding a birthday cake. They soon began to attract national attention, when police officers were dispatched to the scene of the protest and arrested hundreds of

The model included the principle that political opinions are substantially influenced by the average purchasing power of the base in that State of origin, and that the support for political candidates in political power is inversely related to the average purchasing power of the base in that State of origin. The analysis used the average purchasing power of the base in the

But the members of our Armed Forces have every right to go on the field without the support of family members and friends who have sacrificed to protect us.  I wish we could take that safety into account and ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have everything they need to be able to be successful in combat.

This legislation passed the Senate on the 21st of March with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 90-7. The so-called ``farm bill'' is a major step forward in developing a secure and sustainable food and agro-security program for our country. The farm bill contains the changes to the act that address an important element of the agricultural workforce in a number of important ways and moves us toward a workforce that will be ready for the future.  Farmers have taken some of the needed action to meet the challenges and funding in the farm

Mr. President, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia has not gone away as we debate the budget. The history of the war in the former Yugoslavia is that the Serbs and their criminal masters chose to fight because they were following in the footsteps of their predecessors. Their forebears in the SFORF in the 1980s and the United States supported the move against the Serbs for two reasons: first, to teach the Serbs the consequences of defeating them; and second, to prevent the Serbs from conducting aggression against the nonSerbs in Bosnia.  The great man, one of the two, SFORF is not a mission in Bosnia

These are funds in the President's budget that will not be cut, because they are education policy.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today because it is my belief that the status quo in the Senate would not only cause the United States to fall further behind in our battle against terrorism but would also put at risk our ability to pursue our war against ISIS and other violent extremists who are intent on doing us harm. It is important for us to have this debate because we have a responsibility to set the world on a course that will prevent our government from doing anything that would undermine America's security and our future security.

For decades, corrupt campaign spending and abuse of power in North Carolina have been used to block and destroy public and private policy initiatives for the benefit of one Presidential candidate at the expense of the public good. This is not a partisan problem. It is a national problem, one that has gone far too long ignored.

Over the past decade the Congress has come together to implement major legislation to fund the defense of this country and provide more support for critical health programs for our troops and their families. The passage of this bill today is an important step toward the regular appropriations process for the Defense Department and its personnel

Today, our former colleague and dear friend, John Lewis, joins us as guest speaker. I have had the honor to have served with Congressman Lewis in the House of Representatives from 1981 to 1996, and

We are in the early stages of the debate on the last part of the President's emergency powers request that was referred to in our committee last week and our subcommittee hearing this week on Monday and Tuesday of this week. That is a proposal to transfer authority to this new President to put United States troops into Haiti without congressional consent. We have been asked repeatedly to withhold any votes on that portion of the request that dealt with an existing legislative authority to send U.S. troops into Haiti. That part of the President's emergency powers request has been vigorously debated,

The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care through the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS]. The Republican leadership does not allow any Democratic amendments that would provide for the health care of our Nation's veterans. So here we have the most expensive and controversial appropriation bill in the history of our country, and no Democratic amendments allowed. The Republican majority did not allow the amendment that would have provided for the funding of the VA medical facility in Tuscaloosa, AL, providing basic care to our Nation's veterans and their families. The Rules Committee allowed an amendment that would provide the necessary funding for the transportation of our Nation's veterans to VA medical centers across this country. This amendment

The bill makes progress in many areas and does a great job in many others that are so important to our nation's future. But in the area of education funding, I rise to oppose this amendment and oppose the bill that we are debating here today because it ignores those areas that have not yet been addressed and changes them and does not provide the funding

Mr. Speaker, when the new Democrats take over the House this fall, they will focus on many of the issues that make America great. Some of the most important will be in the areas of housing and health care. These are areas that face great challenges and are of particular importance to the constituents of the 29th Congressional District of Illinois and other States in this country.  But Democrats will also take a close look at some of the issues that our fellow Americans are raising in our Nation's capital and in the great cities and inner cities of America. For example, we will end taxpayer subsidies of abortion, and we will put a halt to taxpayer subsidies of

There have been a lot of people here and around the country who have been arguing on behalf of this war in Iraq, but many on this side of the aisle have not been able to see the resolution that is in front of us today. Some of those people have been claiming that

Let me also tell my colleagues something, because I believe that this legislation actually addresses some very real problems that we are dealing with here in the House of Representatives right now. The Department of Defense needs real change here in the Federal Government. We need to spend more money in the Department of Defense to save money and put more money into the Department of Defense than we are spending now. We need to do that to make it more efficient and more effective for the Department of Defense to be able to

That is what we have done to achieve the agreement that we had that would move to a vote today if we could get that agreement before lunch.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to ban access to facilities for abortion counseling and health care for Federal employees.  The antiabortion agenda in this Chamber has been marked for some time, and while not everybody shares this agenda--certainly not by the average American who does not take the time to read the Washington Post or listen to the radio or to listen to the newspapers any more than their non-abortion political base does--those in the mainstream usually take a back seat and do not even try to defend their positions. In truth, the need to ban the practice of abortion is a national emergency.  In the 1950s, a

Madam Speaker, I am here today to support the Better Medicare for All Act because I think we can all agree it is time to make it easier for Americans to save their money and their health care without giving a tax break to the richest Americans.  Our country has a unique system, a government based on two checks. One is Medicare. The other is Medicaid. The government gives money to help people pay for the prescription drugs they need. Medicaid pays for health care for more than 20 million Americans. It does not do anything to tax money people pay to receive health care services they need, and we have to get rid of it now so they will

In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, it is unconscionable that the United States Government would employ the most powerful of all weapons against its citizens and the most vulnerable members of our society--our neighbors and our family members.  The Senate has voted overwhelmingly to pass this bill by a bipartisan vote of 88 to 11 to end these operations against families and individuals we would have loved to have seen abroad.

This program has proven successful in other States. For example, in 2003, for the last 2 years in which the program was in effect, Georgia provided $5.3 million. Tennessee provided $3.4 million in 2003, and South Carolina provided $5.2 million.  The amendment would actually result in eliminating this technology assistance program.

This bill includes two measures that I believe have significant impacts on our economy.

Madam President, I would like to make one additional point on this issue with regard to the question of agriculture as a whole and the so-called Nation of Islam policy. For the vast majority of our citizens in this country and for the State of New Jersey, we have a very good relationship with the so-called Nation of Islam, as we have with many other groups in this country, such as Jewish groups and other groups of religious minorities. We have a lot of them in this country, and we are very proud of that relationship.  It seems to me that we need to get more information about this issue before we make policy decisions that could

As a result of this decision, global trade was hit hard as China became the world's largest importer of cement and crushed concrete at a time when the United States and our allies were fighting a massive war against terrorists in Afghanistan. We have seen this battle played out so much that we may have to amend our entire regulatory system of the last 40 years to make sure that nothing could ever happen

These letters call for legislation to protect the unique combination of habitat in Utah and Colorado that are being allowed to be destroyed by the Utah Clean Water Act of 1990 and the final year of the Clean Water Act of 1992 for the very same reasons for which I am now concerned that we have just had the hearing before the Subcommittee on Water

In fact, one of the two largest issues in the House as we debate this legislation are the cost of government and how much more money it takes to carry out the tasks of government than what is left to the taxpayers on the backs of their hands. And the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] and the others have made the point that as a nation we have spent far more than we should have for government than we are actually spending in a variety of

I know what they say about taxes: taxes increase and increase and increase and increase as more and more and more money goes into your Treasury as a tax, that comes and goes as government borrowing as a tax on your consumers to fund your deficit spending as well as your deficit spending as a tax on your private consumers as a tax to increase
