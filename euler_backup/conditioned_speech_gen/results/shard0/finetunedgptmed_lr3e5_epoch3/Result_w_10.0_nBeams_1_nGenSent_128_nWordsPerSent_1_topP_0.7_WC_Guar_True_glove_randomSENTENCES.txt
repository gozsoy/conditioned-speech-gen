Mr. Speaker, I would like to say that the House Republican plan for a tax cut is not working for the American people. Instead of cutting taxes for the American people in order to give tax breaks to Ohio corporations that ship jobs overseas and give tax breaks to the rules-breaking special interests, this plan will cost $1.6 trillion. That is a lot of money to spend on a tax cut that does nothing to create jobs.  I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues would have the gall to support a plan that will add to our national debt $1.6 trillion. In my opinion, this tax cut is the wrong way to go.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for President Clinton's efforts to democratize the government of Ethiopia and encourage his administration to use this important step to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in Ethiopia.  Human rights abuses continue wasteful and brutal repression of the Ethiopian people. They continue to block the promotion of democracy and democratic ideals, and they continue to undermine the independence and integrity of Ethiopia's military. In addition, the brutal repression of the peaceful protests by the Red Shirts, the government's own ethnic Red Army, continues to continue to this very day.  Mr. Speaker, the lack of democracy and freedom

Mr. President, this morning we are considering consent to proceed to pay Department of Defense appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, which is approximately $15.6 billion. I believe this is a fair and balanced approach to the problems facing the Department of Defense.  I have concerns, however, about the manner in which this bill is being considered. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Roth, and I had an open and constructive exchange of views on this bill, and the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, has already indicated his intention to try to improve the bill. I will support the chairman in his effort.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of legislation that cuts $12 billion in spending over the next two years and will create more than 2 million good important jobs for Americans. I want to thank the bill's author, Mr. Hensarling, for his leadership on this important issue.  When I was a child growing up in South Carolina, I was taught that when people are working hard, they can make it on their own. They can earn enough money to support themselves and their families. This principle has been the hallmark of America for generations, and it is something that we must continue to promote.  Unfortunately, in this economy, we are

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up the amendment of the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, to strike $1 billion in funding for the Smithsonian Institution Post Office Building in Washington, DC. The Senator from Arizona has proposed a modest $400 million cut in this year's appropriation bill, but it is an appropriate cut, because the Post Office Building in Washington, DC, is simply a monument to the Presidency of Lyndon Johnson.  I do not think it is appropriate to ask the American people to pay for the extravagance of the President of the United States. President Johnson's tax cut of 1969 brought a surplus of $9

Madam Speaker, American taxpayers spend more than $1 billion a year on our foreign assistance programs around the world. That number is expected to double in the next decade, and that's $1 billion a year that we are not spending to help developing countries like Ethiopia and Rwanda, the world's poorest and most oppressed people.  Instead of providing this aid, our government has been providing financial assistance to Iran. The administration's policies have led to an economic crisis in the Middle East. The global economy is a mess. We need a comprehensive plan to help turn things around. We need to stop sending money to the wrong places and start providing the resources that

Mr. President, President Bush announced yesterday that the Federal Government will end its tragedy of sending nearly 700 firefighters and police officers to war in Iraq. We will all be better off for the result, but we are better off for the long-term progress that has been made in Iraq.  This tragedy occurred because the President and the President's advisers in the White House decided that sending troops to fight a war of choice was the right thing to do. It was not their idea; it was not the Republican idea; it was not the Democratic idea. The President's idea was to let the Iraqis live their own lives, to do what they wanted to do

Mr. Chairman, I would like to take this time to first of all say that amendment No. 927 that has been offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Beilenson] states that prior to the imposition of this provision the Secretary shall have a right to determine the appropriate regulatory impact on the local community.  I am not sure that the gentleman's amendment has any legal authority to say that a local government cannot make this determination. I have not had a chance to look at the gentleman's amendment. I would ask my colleagues to think about that. I think it is a very reasonable amendment. I think that the Secretary ought to be able

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Court Hearing Protection Act of 2003 to address the court hearing backlog in American courts and to put an end to the court hearing and hearing-day Monday morning Tuesday morning Tuesday afternoon Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and all week long.  The Court Hearing Protection Act would establish a process to help judges review and reduce the court hearing backlog. Judges would have the opportunity to reduce the backlog through a public hearing process, and it would provide judges with the option to reduce the backlog by designating certain days of the week as ``trial by jury'' for certain cases.  This bill would help to eliminate

Mr. Chairman, the States are divided into communities in which the States have not united to combat this virus. We all know the Federal Government is not ready to commit to homeland security.  As a result, we have a lot of areas that are not prepared. In my State of Connecticut, we have very small amounts of funding.  As a result, there are a lot of unmet needs. It is an important issue, but we do not have a national plan to combat this.  In the past, we have seen Congress act. We have acted to create State plans, and we have acted to make sure we can manage the money.

<|endoftext|>I would say that the United States of America and our allies are smarter than the Iraqi people were.

Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress and as American citizens it is fair to ask the United States of America to honor and thank those brave men and women who fought for our freedom and for the future of this country. Today I would like to honor three veterans of that conflict, two of whom fought for the North Dakota National Guard and one of whom fought for the North Dakota Army National Guard.  James ``Woody'' Kim is a decorated veteran of the Korean war, Vietnam, and the United States Army. He has served with the North Dakota National Guard since the age of 22.  This past weekend he gave his final service with his unit,

Madam Speaker, Federal spending is out of control and the President has threatened to veto a budget resolution that balances the budget in 7 years. Speaker Pelosi and Senate Democrats in their infinite wisdom have decided that we must pay for this spending with taxes.  Madam Speaker, I would like to introduce the book ``Tired of Budget Burdens'' by former Republican Congressman Mark Twain. He once said, ``When the devil is in the details, he's in the details.'' This budget document is the devil in the details.  We cannot have a balanced budget if we do not pay for it. And this budget, as the President has said,

Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against this amendment because it would change existing law and would change the application of existing law to protect our Nation's future energy needs and our future opportunities for energy security.

Madam President, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget has announced that Congress will not have a bill until next week because of committee actions. I find it very hard to believe that Congress is going to be in session next week and we will not be able to get a bill to the President. I know it is frustrating, but we cannot do that. I do not know why the Democrats do not understand the consequences of what they have done to the American people.  Last week, this Congress passed the so-called CR. It is a procedural tool that allows a majority of the House to come together and pass a budget resolution. It is
