Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, in Congress we are working on giving Americans an opportunity to shop for jobs with a new Federal job training program under the Workforce Investment Act. The National Center for Career and Technical Education is a very innovative and popular job training system that has gained a great deal of national attention and Congress will soon have an opportunity to test that success by passing the Job Corps Act into law as a part of the Workforce Investment Act. That will give our struggling economy the break it needs to spur job creation and help those who are searching for a job a chance to find one.  Since 2000, the National Center for Career and Technical Education, or NCCT, has trained over 13,000 individuals, supported over 75,000 students, and returned more than $900,000 to school.

Americans depend on their postsecondary education to gain employment that offers higher paying jobs that pay good wages to Americans who want those jobs and to gain those jobs while keeping down the cost of higher education and working to increase percent employment in postsecondary education.

Simply put, the past year has been a whirlwind of imports from China and tariffs imposed by international financial institutions on foreign products from that country are very troubling. It is clear the tariffs imposed by those entities have hit American businesses hard and straining to compete with those imports.

Mr. President, I have been a strong supporter of the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS program. The COPS grant program has been a major success in policing local communities, particularly in communities in cities that have traditionally been at a greater risk for violence because of drug enforcement.  In 1991, less than 10 percent of cities in the United States had any violent crime, and that number was dropping rapidly. By 1992, in large part due to the COPS program, violent crime declined by 50 percent, and many of these cities had begun to see dramatic increases in the crime rate.  I also believe that it is vital that we act now to rebuild the communities that have been damaged by the Columbine High School shooting, and give community-based police services a shot in the arm.

While I support legislation to increase enforcement and resources for immigration enforcement on the border, this bill would expand and expand upon these same proposed efforts by expanding the government hiring authority for enforcement jobs and expanding the authority to spend tax dollars on enforcement activities under the Immigration and National Security Act of 1986. This would create unnecessary cost increases and would also require cuts in funding for our communities by increasing demands for additional safety enforcement personnel and resources.  Given the fact that this Congress has passed over 900 bipartisan immigration reform measures, this issue is not up for debate and is not a part of the Contract With America.

This election was a result of the international community's failure to hold this election under international supervision and the efforts of the president of the Belarusian Federation.

Medicare Advantage has had overwhelming support from the health care community and has been supported by the public welfare community as well as the private health care system. Moreover, the Congress has not enacted legislation to increase funding for the Medicare Program and Medicare Advantage. The legislation passed the House legislation amendment, and the Senate passed the appropriations bill that increases spending on Medicare Advantage by $11 billion over the next 3 years. However, there is considerable confusion and misinformation about the Medicare Advantage Program as well as the changes that the bill makes to the eligibility standards for Medicare recipients, including changes to the eligibility rules for Medicaid, to

Of course, this celebration is not complete, as we still work on making our work ethic better and safer.  In recent months, I have attended rallies around the country, joined hundreds of labor leaders in their efforts to improve the working conditions at places like Wal-Mart and everywhere in between. These workers are tough, hard-working people who are justifiably fighting for a better life for their families, for better health care for their children, for higher wages for their employers, and for new job opportunities for their communities.

Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise to urge the Republican leadership of this House to work with us on a bill that will help rebuild our economy.  But as we look at this bill, not only does the Republican majority have a part in the efforts to make sure that some of the tax cuts go to the wealthiest Americans but the Democratic leadership of this House has a part as well that is expansion of those tax cuts that the Republican majority has supported.  So let me just read, again, that. This bill gives a total of $5.9 billion over the next 5 years to the wealthiest people in our country, $30 billion of that to those at the top income bracket. The other $7 billion in this bill goes to $5.9 billion for the lower income people in this country, and the tax cuts

Madam Speaker, last week, the Congressional Human Rights Commission met with defectors from North Korea who have been forced to give up their ability to make a living in South Korea in order to continue their human rights work in North Korea. The Commission reports that North Korean officials have not only failed to meet human rights standards in their own country but have also so far made significant changes to the Government of North Korea to make it even more of a state controlled dictatorship.  However, to make the situation even more intolerable for the defectors who have been living in South Korea, Speaker Pelosi has recently proposed that the Administration engage in discussions with North Korean officials to try to persuade them to change their repressive regime.

Mr. President, this important program, administered by the Natural Resource Conservation Service within USDA, provides needed assistance to communities in our Nation who have historically suffered damage from natural disaster. Local communities have traditionally had their own natural resources and the natural resources of their local communities and community reservoirs located in their communities. This provides community residents with a base from which they can rely for their protection of the local natural resources and the municipal and county assets of the affected areas. In a community that is facing a natural disaster, FEMA can be a crucial source of funding and help local communities navigate the cost of recovering from natural disaster.  FEMA's role is to restore these assets to their pre-disaster levels as quickly as possible. After these communities recover and rehabilitation projects are started, FEMA can provide an additional $50 million to help build better health and recovery capabilities

The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight members on both sides of the aisle have reported out bipartisan initiatives to implement the provisions of the LMDA into title I of the statute. In keeping with this bipartisan agreement, there has been no Member from the party that controls the House or the Senate--Democrat or Republican--who has offered an amendment which would negatively impact the integrity of the LMDA.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Bruce Edward McNabb, a lifelong resident of Grand Rapids, MI, who passed away on January 23rd, 2016. Mr. McNabb, who served as secretary of the Grand Rapids Community Fund Board from 1981 to 1988, dedicated his life to public service and public policy in Grand Rapids and throughout Michigan.  Throughout his decorated career, Mr. McNabb made a career of public service as a former candidate for President of the Michigan State College System, Michigan Free Press and Mayor of Grand Rapids. He became known as an effective butte legislator in Grand Rapids, and the city of Grand Rapids became a hub of higher education.

I am seeking unanimous consent to insert language which would prohibit the Department of the Interior and, by implication, the Department of the Army from issuing any permit for those dredging operations, including those already authorized in the permit.

I appreciate that. That was a great description by the Senator.

The President said his tax cut would reduce taxes in Ohio by about $1.6 billion, I'm assuming. I could find, there is no Senator from the State of Ohio who paid any tax in 2003, I'm going to read the bill. This year, we're talking about nearly $1.7 billion. So if we assume we have 6.9 million people who pay some taxes or pay very little taxes, we've had a $6.2 billion tax cut. So from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.

I have said a few times today I think the farm bill is dead on arrival in this Senate and we should do something about it instead of a continuing resolution that continues to put Americans to work doing nothing. So when I talk about the farm bill, the need for a farm bill that will grow this country out of this crisis that is facing this country that we just came through the story of our country in which they are shutting down their government and the government of one President who has been unable to get anything done over the last couple of years, what we are talking about is a time period that the President does not have to respond to the taxpayers of this country.  If we could have a farm bill that was a simple, straight-

Mr. President, I rise today to continue the debate on this historic opportunity to adopt the balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution and to begin the process of government reform that the American people have demanded. Over the past 3 years we have seen a period of unprecedented congressional deficits and record debt. Even more alarming, government spending has nearly tripled in recent years. More than $900 billion worth of trillion-dollar debt and nearly $3.5 trillion in taxpayer-funded spending has accumulated over the last decade. It is irresponsible for those of us who believe in the American Dream to be standing here today debating the consequences of our failure to realize that America does not have the will or the power to return to a balanced budget.  It is a disgrace that Congress cannot be expected to focus on debt reduction if we are in the midst of

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to illustrate the grave implications which resulted from the untimely death of a constituent, his hero, the late Sergeant Douglas Davis in action in Vietnam on April 1. These are troubling times for all Vietnam Americans and Vietnamese Americans. To this end, I am pleased to bring to the attention of our colleagues a Supplemental Remembrance Policy that specifically specifically relates to the manner in which the families of these brave Americans have handled this difficult time. The document outlines the importance that the families have placed on these events to illustrate to the American people the heartbreak and loss experienced by the families of Vietnam soldiers, and the insensitivity of the administration toward this terribly tragic event.  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this package to ensure that this event would not be forgotten nor take place in the future.

Their concern seems to be about the fact that the Federal Government is going to be the one that comes in and is part of this settlement if the Service really is paying the bill.

You cannot pay those costs by the Army. So what the issue is, what the issue here is is that you have to pay this bill by the Pentagon, and, of course, that means the Pentagon might have to come in and take the hit and pick up a tab, plus an even more, just to fund the Army, when they really are not

This legislation will provide Medicare beneficiaries with the ability to keep more of their own money and ensure that Medicare remains a fair funding program for our Nation's seniors. Medicare cuts will be more difficult to enact because this plan does not limit spending increases or increase rates of enrollment. It simply raises the amount of money that can be collected from the doctor's office.  Without this amendment, H.R. 4994 will have real costs associated with the program as people now have the option to pay more out of their own pockets to get health coverage and hold out hope for the better part of the long term.

Mr. Speaker, it is certainly time for Congress to do its job. Just last week President Clinton said that he is ``out of this Congress in 3 years.'' He did not get elected because he is not a Democrat and he is not a Republican but because he is a person who cares about people. Speaker Gingrich just a few weeks ago appeared on the NBC program ``Nightline'' where he talked about how the people of his party cared about people.  Speaker Gingrich told his listeners on ``Nightline'' last week that ``the Zika virus is an existential threat to the United States.  ``When it's made public, it creates massive health problems. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats in this House want to enact a health care system that lowers our costs.''  As a Member of the other body, Mr. Speaker, I hope

Mr. President, the Senate is presently on the verge of approving a measure that is the product of bipartisan compromise and full understanding that we must provide veterans with the best available health care. This bill is a strong bipartisan compromise measure that Senator Feinstein and I, with Senator Levin and Senator Mikulski, have crafted in conjunction with Senators Manchin, Portman, Coats, and Lugar. It provides improved access to prosthetics and prosthetic limb prosthetics that GMOs will benefit, is modernized to meet the medical needs of today's battlefields, and ensures continued funding for veterans health care and critical medical research.  Our bill improves access to prosthetics and limb prosthetics and eliminates several duplicative requirements and increases funding to meet the needs of veterans and servicemembers.

Mr. Speaker, the President was wise in vetoing this bill. This is terrible energy policy, putting us back to the period that we had the greatest oil production and saved us from that decline and losing some jobs to other countries. Those are two points. It is a well-planned and well-rehearsed appropriations bill. It goes to a place where every question can be answered and all the debates have been covered up to the last vote and out of the 60 percent people who will be voted on who can be cast on this question, it is an open and inclusive process.  As my friend from New York said, the economy is much less than before, and we are going to see increases in wages.

Rising to the challenge of coaching the Reds to the 1994 World Series was the 1996 NL All-Star catcher, Joe Cano. In his first season coaching the team, Catcher Cano was named to the Baseball Writers Association of America's All-Star team. He followed that by guiding his team to its first NL Central pennant.

Even though I, like all of the Members of Congress who have offered a balanced budget amendment, have supported a long-term spending cap that will take us to balance by 1997, we have had to delay that until after this year. Now that we have come back and have finally passed our balanced budget plan and have the foresight to take the

Mr. President, there is one more matter. I was handed this. On behalf of Senator Landrieu, and others in the Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Dorgan and I have asked that the committee cease to engage in any further such legislative action as a result of the February 28 operations briefing to Members of the Senate Armed Forces. I am asking for the Congress to suspend this action and let the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Members of the committee who filed their behalf notify the President when they will resume legislative action.  I would say to the Senator from Alabama, and to the other members of the committee, that we would hope that they would think of what was their objection and give the President ample opportunity to sign this bill. I thank the chairman of the committee.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Their contributions to the educational future of our country have been greatly aided by the administration and the outstanding support of the teachers of the School of the Americas Program in the capital city of Mexico City. Tina Bravo, a project assistant in the Office of the National Coordinator for the Development of Education, was awarded this prestigious award for exemplary contributions to education programs.  Ms. Bravo graduated from English class at the age of 10. Since then, she has served as the assistant principal of Teachers College Preparatory Academy in California, and is currently a school math teacher at Pima High School. Currently Ms. Bravo is working for the U.S. Department of Education as a science and technology librarian,

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Ben Gilman, for getting this time for us to consider his bill to protect our Nation from a threat that will attack America as the world watches the events of this weekend. We all want to defend our Nation and protect its interests. But we all know that our Nation is not a country of stability and that even if you take it apart, that body of the American people is still a Nation in total disorder.  The natural disaster that struck in the State of New Jersey was another harbinger of things to come, Mr. Speaker. As Ben Gilman was just discussing, this is a problem that is never going to be resolved. New Jersey will never be the same. We will never be safe in our communities again.

Today I would like to speak about the contributions of the State of Michigan to our national society and the state of the union of workers in the United States.  Throughout its long history as the union federation representing workers in Michigan, the AFL-CIO has been a champion for workers' rights. During the days of slavery, Jim Crow, women were prohibited from holding union jobs. The AFL-CIO was at its apex during the years of the Chicago Gold Rush in the late 1800s and helped secure a country for millions of workers in the face of harsh competition. Many children

That has not happened in the past.

Mr. President, five years ago today, the National Literacy Act of 1991 became law. In the first year of the law all Americans would be encouraged to read at least one page of the next four Federal laws passed by Congress or President Bush. This legislation also authorized public service agencies to establish, expand, and improve computer literacy programs.

I understand the majority leader has not agreed to do that either and I hope he withdraws that request because if we move this bill to conference and it is not turned over to him as I understand it he may not be able to work his friend, Representative Dan Glickman, out of that and then possibly other Senators so he will not get the conference report.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong support for the Coast Guard and the Secretary of Transportation in their new agency budget. This is the largest agency in Federal Government spending in 16 years and the fourth agency to bear the brunt of the attack by the Guard on its budgets, which the people of California have consistently asked for since the 1970's.  This is a no-spending agency that we are considering this evening in express support of its budgets. Under these circumstances, the Coast Guard's budget is obviously vital to our region's business, commerce, and maritime activities and includes provisions to provide for increases in the Coast Guard's security costs. It is crucial that the Coast Guard continues to make significant progress with regard to continuing to modernize its capabilities, to improve capacity for the training and experience of our Coast Guard and other emergency

What is interesting about tourism is, why do people go into the outdoors? It is the very outdoors where tourism grows. There is less danger and no longer danger for people who go into that part of the country. There is more of a sense of self- surfficiency, a feeling of purpose, where you are off on your own. In essence, what has happened in this country is that tourism to the point where more people have gone to the natural resource areas have occurred, but the other functions, of the person, or an organization, has been performed by others, by the private sector.  The result, of course, is that tourism is diminished. In fact, with increases in natural resource areas, tourism is decreasing. So there is a tendency for more jobs being lost to tourism because of the profit potential.  With

Again, I say to the Senator from Illinois that it is incumbent upon Congress to act when it needs to. Congress has not debated and Caucus has not reviewed this measure, it seems to me. The Vice President pro tempore has certainly shown the wisdom of this measure.

I am deeply concerned that the current system has led to a reduction of care for so many Americans.

And the reason for that is because it has the standards and the context and the risk of the new labor that the American worker was promised is really worth $500 million more than the Canadian work they have in front of them, whereas we are actually getting 10,000, 11,000 Canadian workers that the American workers are given a total of $500 million over what the Canadian labor would be.

Madam President, last night with the passing of our revered colleague, Senator Strom Thurmond, I will rise today to pay tribute to Senator North Carolina's most distinguished former colleague and friend and to call to the Nation our Nation's honor that he has served in the United States Congress. North Carolina Senator John Northup will be deeply missed as a South Carolinian and as an icon of this country.  Born in 1941, John lived his whole life in Raleigh. His first foray into politics was as a newspaper reporter, where he was elected to his first term, 1974. Senator Northup then spent his distinguished career in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served as one of the first African American Members of the House.  In 1975, Northup ran for Governor of North Carolina, his first statewide office. He lost a close

Mr. President, this amendment on wetlands mitigation banking has been cleared by both sides, and the amendment has been accepted by the Republican leader and the Democratic leader as being consistent with the policy under which they have been planning to support this legislation if this amendment passes on a party-line vote as soon as it has been given to the administration.  The rawler amendment which the Senator from New Mexico has previously discussed has a similar provision in it that is specific to projects under the bill. It does not extend the portion of this legislation under which, in implementing the original 302(b) allocation, the administration would use the $1 million deposit from the Wetlands Bank for wetland mitigation projects.  That was the intent of the Congress when they authorized the Wetlands Bank. The policy pursued by the Congress and the administration, it is hoped

We certainly think we could have seen that happen maybe even quite surprised. So that's why I was so moved to get out here and start talking about the issue of bicyclists.

I have to say this is a tax bill that has a lot of focus on paying for the debt repayment that we have already asked lenders to pay; and the one thing that is bad about this is it increases taxes, raising taxes by $2.5 trillion on the middle class.

Madam Speaker, three blocks from our White House, the World Bank is subsidizing the administration and the World Bank today to engage in a $70 billion $700 million oil program for Iran, to reduce sanctions on Iran's nuclear program, and to give the administration free rein to continue to say that billions of dollars can and must be subsidized to Iran in their quest to become a nuclear power.  It is no wonder that the Persian Gulf War is in question. It is no wonder that there is a budding competition for world leadership in a region that is prone to crises and rising power.  Iran has never been in a position to do the heavy lifting for the Middle East. They have no ability, obviously, to bring about a radical change in the Middle East.

Mr. Speaker, this has been a good debate on this bill over 2 days. Before I say a few words about the bill and a few of the witnesses we have had from both sides of the aisle to debate this bill, let me just talk for a moment about the original legislation that the chairman and the ranking member David Smith brought forward. I think they did an outstanding job in terms of helping that bill move forward. It was interesting to me that David Smith and I had the bill passed by Reid-Leahy and by a similar vote and then the bill came back and was a Catherine Samuelson, R-NY, substitute that I was not able to vote for, so I don't think my colleagues appreciate my vote on that.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this Republican substitute. First,

Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, let me say I was not the chairman of that committee when we considered the amendment earlier this year that I am offering today and I did not yield to it until we thought we might have something we could all support. I did not want to be back here again doing that again because I really do think we ought to be looking at ways we can bring good things to the people that we just want happy with. We are better than this, people. So when you raise the specter of interfering with existing funds of science research in this country, I think it would be reasonable to suggest that there are some things that we ought to be looking at.  The whole idea that there are some special grants that are so expensive that it is unreasonable to invest in it, I think that is

Every day we know of another State or Federal agency that has sent these workers back to work without pay or benefits and without health care.  The cost of unemployment benefits runs into the millions of dollars for each State and Federal employee.  Those who have been working for over 3 months in one State, weeks on end--and have not been able to find a new job--is an understatement. And without the workforce, our economy, for those of us here who support Federalism and a free-market system, would wither on the vine.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I again yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Owens). As many of us here will recall, in a time when Speaker Gingrich was presiding as Secretary of the Interior, the New York delegation made it clear that the Department of the Interior should be managed by the Secretary of the Interior and not the Secretary of Agriculture and that there should not be any foreign acquisition of land, any efforts to buy land for the Secretary of the Interior, anything of that nature, American citizens, from China.  So I would just urge that the gentleman from New York, the chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Conservation, the Committee on Science, the committee that is represented by the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), the ranking member, look at the testimony that the gentleman

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are going to have three Democratic amendments and three Republican amendments and be on the bill with no rollcall votes at the same time. So if we have that problem now in the amendment process, I don't know what it would take for Senator Grassley and Senator Schumer to take Democratic amendments and Republican amendments and get those finished and then send the bill to the President.  It would take a little time, I suppose, but we would get it done if it is not an overwhelming response, if we can rollcall votes, and then go to the White House and to the appropriators and tell them we will see if there is a way to complete this bill. It may be a little longer than we have wanted. But the people of the United States deserve the opportunity to see a bill

This rule strikes and we have struck some very important provisions which are very important in my own State of Oregon and in the State of the Government of the United States of America.  Our government is stubbornly and often brutally weak in some areas of our society and when we look at many of the programs and services that are provided by government to our citizens and the people who visit us in government-congested areas and Vietnamese people who work in these institutions, we are really asking for a very serious correction.

I strongly support this bill and I think it would be a good thing for the country if we could work in a responsible way to make sure this much more difficult time could be avoided for those American business people that need help today and we can find that out with other tools that the committee can use to help those affected businesses today. That is related to my amendment which would have put back in this bill the law that would have established a program for small businesses in Fort Worth that would help them stay afloat and help them maintain an adequate supply of capital to operate.  This bill that we are considering today has limited funds. Most of the money in this bill today has to do with the Small Business Administration, of which I have to say I am proud to be the ranking

It is not that we can't give that assistance but we have not been able to do it because the Lee amendment allows for the loan guaranty to be effective on an interest-only basis.

It is my hope that this agency and the Department of Defense and the Department of State can move in a manner which has the support of both members of the Armed Services and the community at large, which will enable the services to provide the capabilities they have requested and need in many different situations, which I think is an important distinction to make.  I rise in support of the Dole amendment and in particular in support of the section that provides for priority in ordering the quantities and the kinds of supplies which are necessary for the armed services.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a consortium of 25 primary and secondary and postgraduate medical schools in the Nation that provides exceptional medical training for individuals of all age groups and professions throughout the Nation. I am pleased that these schools have worked so diligently to integrate clinical experience with medical training through programs like kits and elective surgery to treat traumatic injuries to the joints and muscles.  These institutions have shown a strong commitment to providing a quality medical education, along with continuing medical education. But with the success of the multi-specialty training program at this school, they want to expand this medical education even further.

Mr. Chairman, individual, regional, or general permitting actions by the Federal Government cannot prohibit a State from permitting a competitive or additional surface transportation project. If a State finalizes its decision in the same year as final approval for the final title of a project, then that State's action does not affect the Federal Government's or the permit applicant's interpretation of the State's provisions concerning those provisions.  These opportunities for reasonable interpretations do exist. For many States projects permit construction along waterways and harbor entrances. For example, Utah River and Grand Staircase Escalante State Recreation Area in California permits six bridges along the Verde River, as well as separate roads in this area, and for many years has constructed well over 40 miles of the Navigable Waterway System.

In fact, obstruction is not limited to the courts and the legislative process but in our country the courts as well as the legislative process have taken it upon themselves to place the specific legal requirements that are necessary for the consideration of business in a legal process. These court standards, which were established in the Federal Trade Commission Act, affect the effect of our collective governmental function and impede legislative action, our business in this country.  Each of us was blessed with the opportunity to have the opportunities to work, at the grassroots level, to get things done in the Congress of the United States of America. We worked hard in all of our 4 years here. We wanted to come here and lead

Mr. President, I oppose the passage of the Omnibus appropriations conference report. The bill before us today funds the Government at last year's level of $1.16 trillion, or $1.7 billion per person in 2005 dollars. This is the first year in which Congress has failed to extend the provisions of the 2001 and 2002 farm bill that created the so-called flexibility program that is responsible for allowing more farmers to plant less for the Committee on Agriculture.  With a minimum level of job loss at the time of the farm bill, Congress should have created a system that was not simply unable to meet the demands of our current food crisis but that would keep many in our home State and national economy on the road to economic recovery.  While the Omnibus appropriation bill continues this effort to stabilize America's farm sector, in my view the

Mr. President, today I recognize Frankfort, SD. Founded in 1882, the town of Frankfort will celebrate its 100 years this coming Saturday. The town of Frankfort celebrates 100 years of service and a legacy of small town grit and determination to help South Dakota achieve its first-ever congressional seat. I am proud to be a founding sponsor of this anniversary event.  In the spring of 1865, a peaceful disturbance involving a railroad accident forced the end of the Union U.S.S. Groves. The roots of Frankfort lay in the Peabody Coal and River Railroad that crossed the I-90 bridge from Everett, SD, to Peabody. The town of Frankfort was once home to 18 miners from the Peabody Coal River. These coal miners were union members who originally worked for Old & Middle Railroad, a major railroad

It was so important for our air and our water that Congress would say to the Environmental Protection Agency that they must be responsible to the American people for policies that were passed by Congress but they would have to be accountable to the American people who did not have a say in that policy. So the Republicans stepped in, took the reins of leadership at the EPA, and stopped the executive overreach, all the overreach.

I thank my friend for that response.

So it was not unusual for the administration and the legislature in trying to limit the kinds of abuses that might occur that would tend to compromise important public safety interests.

With spending exceeding $270 billion for Iraq, and that number expected to increase in the coming fiscal year, there is no question that funding for the Iraq War has fallen far short of the $700 billion spent in Afghanistan.
