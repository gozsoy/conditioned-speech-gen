Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I speak in opposition to the amendment.  Let me thank Chairman Castle and Mr. Price and their staffs for their hard work in putting this bill together to ensure the needs of the elderly in Maine and across the country are met and better. This bill funds medical care for those with diabetes, and it funds the very services that the elderly need to manage and live with dignity.  Our economy continues to struggle to recover, and our seniors should not bear the brunt of these financial challenges. We should support these funds in such a way that they make good financial sense to the Government and to the people we help provide the care for them, and that is what we do here in this legislation.

If supply and demand is the major way to deal with speculation, I believe the Federal Reserve should not deal with banks and companies that make money on speculation in the American economy. Would the Senator agree that those who make money off of speculation would be subjected to a regulation that most would find offensive and would result in even greater economic harm to the American people if they have to sell their positions to a credit company or other entity? Would the Senator agree that that kind of regulation is not the way to deal with speculation in our economy and that we should have an alternative that was put forward by the chairman and ranking member and put in the legislation to provide relief to them and to help them take care of their workers as well?

Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, in Congress we are working on giving Americans an up-or-down vote on the minimum wage increase to $7.25 an hour. We are working to make it work, to make it a real break. Congress must, as it should, follow the American people's lead, and we will be here today defending their hard-earned dollars.  While a close vote in support of the minimum wage will always be a disappointment, it is absolutely vital that this important vote in Congress occur for the safety of all workers. Today, American workers have to make difficult decisions when it comes to caring for their families. For them to take money away from the work of their neighbors is reprehensible, and it is equally reprehensible for employers to put people at risk to do business with them.

However, the Committee on Appropriations has been forced to reject proposals such as the House amendment, which is nothing more than a flat out attack on the work of the Department of Health and Human Services to reduce the number of children and pregnant women who are denied health care through no fault of their own.

It would have to be a determination that the military needs military timber in its industry, which is currently the case, or that the military needs to use those for fuel efficiency or other purposes.  I am only opposed to this amendment as a result of concerns that it would increase the costs of military equipment and operations, both in the supply chain and the procurement process.  The underlying bill would not require the timber sale to be undertaken as a result of an environmental impact statement, and the result would be the business of the military being diminished in a way that would hurt its operations and even its capability to meet those operations and their missions and

As a number of my colleagues have already noted, there is an agenda for the United Nations Human Rights Council that is far reaching and important. Working groups have begun to craft a number of resolutions, and the Prime Minister of Jordan will present a proposal to the council for consideration on September 21.  In my view, the U.N.

This year's budget resolution is clearly a step in the right direction to return the Federal Government to fiscal responsibility. It increases fiscal year 1995 operating appropriations by $50 million and reflects the level of spending that the House has already passed by $49 million in fiscal year 1995. Further, we provide a strong increase in the Pell Grant Program, which provides an important funding source for low-income low-and moderate-income students. Also, the budget continues the efforts to bring fiscal accountability to the Federal Government by increasing revenues in the last quarter by $3 billion above the 1996 level.  In addition to increasing revenues for the last quarter of fiscal year 1995, this budget increases

That is very accurate because we have had more than 150 people cited for illegal activity since 1987. The active fraud rate is approximately 14 percent. That is now up to the Federal standards for fraud as of November 28 of this year. It is the second highest rate in the history of the Federal program under those standards. We also have to face the fact that since the 1990 amendments on the refundability law, fraudulent filings have dropped off the charts. So it is the filing of fraudulent filings that is now at record lows in the past 2 years, not the fraud, not the filing of fraudulent returns and bankruptcy issues as a result of this program that has worked for many years and worked very well.

Mr. President, 3 years ago, the country of Belarus held a presidential election that marked--instead of changing, as was the expected result of this election--a new President based on a particularly dubious combination of authoritarianism and respect for power, including the appointment of a Vice President in the absence of any other means for ensuring fair representation by the international community.  Yet under the constitutional guarantees of democratic rule that we are supposed to uphold, Belarus saw no such challenge. And while it is impossible to know for sure if the historic elections held in Belarus that took place 2 years ago would have changed the course of Belarus, it is certain that the Belarusian President is only one side of the same political coin.  President Lukashenka promised that he would grant the President of the Republic of Belarus a seat in the Supreme Court and in the Belarus

I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for allowing this inquiry. As the Senator is well aware, the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation has recently held a series of hearings on the passage of the consumer health initiative which has been reviewed by this Senate in the past several years. As a result of these hearings, the administration has reached an agreement with the Senate regarding health safety and education reform which is known as the HEALTH Act.  It is the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, as is the Senator from Massachusetts, whose jurisdiction would require an additional hearing of this issue on the issue of health safety and education reform. I would ask the Senator from Massachusetts if that inquiry could be answered by the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, may I just conclude by saying that there are now 5 million people in this country that have no health insurance and many more that are overinsured because the insurance companies have taken advantage of the system they have created to make profits off their customers without having any accountability to those customers or those taxpayers and because of that the marketplaces which are in place now will not provide a very good return on investment. They have failed.  So it will not be only the lack of competition, but the policies and lack of support that have brought about this decline in coverage. We need to continue to build on the work we have already done over the last 6 years and work to provide our families with the same choices we have offered them and to ensure that if people have health insurance today

As a young boy in Rogers, Buddy, then 17 years old, befriended an older soldier named Pete Delaney. At the young age of 13, Buddy helped Pete qualify for the National Guard. Shortly after his enlistment, Buddy witnessed the tragic events that took place in Waco and Irving, TX, and quickly sought out the boys who had lost loved ones in that tragic city.

Yet they also get to spend taxpayer dollars to improve their health care and they are paid not to spend it. Now, it is interesting that, because they are getting this money, the federal employee who spent it has to go on the Medicare Program and pay $17 million for the Medicare Part D benefits, which they received when they were paid well to work and they went

The Commission urged the government to grant full amnesty to those detained in North Korea, and it urged the government to remove all children from the labor camps.

What the gentlewoman from Massachusetts has proposed in this very important bill is to do away with the current practice which has been to have state workers designated as police officers and then transfer the responsibility of those officers to the local police force without any other State resources being used or responsibilities being transferred from the local community

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), my colleague and friend on the Committee on Ways and Means, to discuss the investigation into Hurricane Katrina and the crisis it created. The response of the Committee on Appropriations has been tremendous and represents Congress in a time of need and has been extraordinary in bringing to the Committee's attention this crisis that was caused by the hurricane and the human toll it had on so many lives and so many things in our community and our State. It is about time that we start addressing this issue and we start really taking a look at what we can do to put the hurricane victims ahead of the political advantage that the administration has over Congress in the appropriations process.  cticaeronto.house.gov  EDITOR'S NOTE: The Speaker of the House has made a

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to engage the esteemed chairman in a colloquy concerning language in the bill that I authored regarding S. 1338. This important legislation will authorize the U.S. Coast Guard to acquire seven shipbuilding projects in the State of New Jersey and build them on the Great Neck Canal in northern New Jersey. This area was a crucial hub for the making of the aircraft carrier, and the Great Neck will not be all that ``new'' when it comes out of the Great Ocean just a few years from now, but it should still be an important part of our Nation's defense policy for the next 40 years.  We have already approved the contract for the procurement of the three vessels in the order that I have just given the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. However, I do not have as much information

President Clinton's policy proposals for reducing the tax burden for American families were criticized time and again by Republicans. We Republicans and Democrats agree on the need to improve the Tax Code to bring a better level of fairness to all Americans and help middle-class Americans feel that their taxes are being paid in a fair and responsible way.

Mr. Chairman, first let me commend the gentleman from California [Mr. Campbell] for the extremely fine presentation on the bill. I believe it is one of the most worthy and capable programs that we have seen in the Federal Government in a long time. It is a high priority of mine and of this subcommittee and I am very pleased that the bill does provide a particular key for what is an important project in many areas in California, to the West, and in many parts of the world.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to make a few observations about the bill before I make the statements that I am sure are very clear to anyone who has read it and watched the debate on the floor on the bill that I believe is a very good bill. I want to speak also about something that I think is a difficult statement that I have read and

Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today to pose an important question to this House of Representatives. How many families in the United States of America are struggling to provide for the education of their children today? How many of these parents, many of them, do you have in the district that I represent that just recently had to give up their sole parent to provide for the education of the child? What will it be like for the average family in that district of 11 to be faced with this choice and a bill that might make those decisions as to whether to buy more Federal Government-funded student loans or not?  All I know is that the number of low-income students who would be forced into default is growing. These are the families and the children and the parents that I represent.

My friend has observed all the goings-on very closely.

When he did that in Afghanistan it was the death of many and destruction of the country as well as the loss of many lives and we all know what the result was in a very short period of time and time again and for which the United States was responsible through the action of its armed forces. The failure of the United States to support the strong Afghan Government in the years that followed was the cause of enormous frustration and

When the Bush Administration signed off on this plan to invade Iraq in October of this year it did so in full confidence that this would be a success and that the invasion would be long and drawn out with minimal loss of life or loss of American lives in Iraq. In short, that this plan would be what the President hoped would happen in the first place when he signed this ``mission control'' resolution to send his troops

Mr. Chairman, the boogeyman of Russian coal and Vladimir Putin really do strain credulity. In fact, the real Russian coal industry is already moving to China and Europe and is exporting coal and gas over the whole eastern European region. It is growing and Russia is a major and significant market for Russian coal and gas. And Ukraine was a key beneficiary of this export financing.  Our new friend, Vladimir Putin, has repeatedly called for energy independence for Russia, and when he gets his way, America and Europe will suffer. We've got our friends in Russia right now going to China to buy from the Chinese to export coal and gas. There is a real threat to Russia's energy independence in Europe and in the Ukraine and the United States. So I urge my colleagues to support the Porter amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.

That is what we all want to do. As has been mentioned many times in this debate, it has been hard to reduce the spending without increasing the revenue because the way that revenues come in is dependent upon revenues from various other sources that are always able to take precedence over the Federal Government which is always able to receive them from all other sources of government revenue. I think we all agree on that principle and would support the two points that have been discussed here today, that we should increase the money that is coming in to the Federal Government but not by increasing the money that the private sector would

Mr. President, before describing the amendment, let me talk briefly in opposition to Senator Graham's amendment on No Child Left Behind. First of all, the most important point the Senator is making is that this is not a constitutional amendment for the purpose of saying that we have to send additional troops into Iraq and Afghanistan or another military conflict. No constitutional amendment in the last 10 years was ever proposed to place soldiers or funds in the hands of the executive branch of government. What it is asking the Congress to do is to say we must have Congress send out a clear directive in writing that the President of the United States must sign that document when it is signed into law by the President of the United States.  So while I do not believe that the amendment of the Senator from Florida that she has filed would result in a constitutional amendment--that there are

The American people want a balanced budget that does not hurt children. They do not want it to be a full day in court that it has to come to a vote to make a determination about whether they want to go to jail or go to college.

This would do nothing to reduce the overpayments that are made by Medicare to the highest rate of Medicare beneficiaries. So I say to the majority leader that I will oppose the amendment as long as it is offered by the Senator from New Mexico and not by the other side to cut Medicare benefits, which will simply deny thousands of senior citizens affordable health insurance.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Today I rise to honor Montana World War II veteran Charlie DeCrane, a member of the First Baptist Church of the First Coast in Little Eagle, Montana. I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to his family and friends for this long and honorable service to this country and to this Nation in World War II.  Charlie first joined the First Baptist Church of the First Coast in 1947 after graduating from Little Eagle High School and when asked why he wanted to serve the church, he told a teacher that it was ``because it is about the Lord, so that when you are in a place of trouble, the Lord has your help and will protect you.''  When he was 19 years old he began working at a local post office while being laid off from his job as a bank teller to join the First Baptist Church of the First Coast

Let us think of the control measures that are available and the necessity of such measures when we are trying to control major infectious diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. We need to concentrate our efforts on prevention and sanitation rather than on prevention. We need to look at prevention, not prevention research.  When AIDS was first found in Africa in 1975, many were still afraid to enter Africa.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5830, the Private Property Protection Act of 2006.  My home State of Ohio is a proud homeland of many legal residents and other entities and industries. In fact, Ohio has a strong reputation as being a model for responsible environmental regulations.  Congress has created four agencies in the Federal Government devoted to protecting property rights: the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Bureau of Land Management.  As we know, in the last Congress, legislation passed the House proposing to authorize the Federal Government to prohibit the transport of body-worn cameras that may be used to monitor the law enforcement activities on private property without the consent of a owner and without effective litigation authority and

Mr. President, based on what I said earlier, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 39, Mr. Gregg Mitchell of New Jersey, to be a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New Jersey; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.  The  utilitarian reason to do this is because of the need to have the Senate continue the legislative session in order to complete the debate on the nomination and the line-item veto amendment as well as other legislative items. The legislative session has also been strained because of a number of business negotiations that have been involved with the work of the Government Operations Committee that is being held here on the Senate floor as well as a number of other important issues that are

It has been one of the most significant accomplishments for me and so many of my colleagues who are not so familiar with this and have so much to be proud of this effort. It is to our credit that we have now made it possible for the Department of Homeland Security to function even though we have been faced with another failed government in that the first one was so very disappointing and so very short-term. But we are here for the long haul to actually complete this bill this year to give it the appropriate and legal authorities and the time to actually get to work in those areas that we have been able to keep this in the budget before the last one

I disagree with the constitutional procedures with respect to this particular nomination and with respect to the judges. I strongly oppose the nomination and would like to speak for a few moments about it.

But the gentlewoman did that anyway to get there, and so we were not able to accept the amendment here.

But the most important thing we have to do, and that is to stop it and keep our children healthy and secure and to have our health care people on the job working and not to send them home without the necessary health insurance for their children and for their families that we are providing in this legislation, is to stop it. We cannot do that if we are going to have a society that is working with respect to providing adequate health care to our children and the good health of our nation.

We have to have that vote because it is a vote about whether Congressmen or Congresswomen will stay in this body or go out on their own as candidates for State office or something else.

He was followed in the 1950s by another 15-year-old baseball star named Bill Sellers, now the second oldest ever to play in the majors, who in 1963 would follow Ascanio in fame in the major leagues as well. The fact that both of these players had such an impact on today's baseball generations is somewhat surprising to say the least.

If I can get the attention of Senator Chafee, last night, Senator Bingaman, my colleague who has been on the floor a few times this evening, described to us the extraordinary difficulty that the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] had with the Financial Services Committee for the last 5 or 6 years. The Financial Services Committee was dysfunctional on the surface and I believe it is still so, but the gentleman from New York has told us so much about the difficulty that the committee had with the board that they have for the last 10 or 12 years called it the Department of the Treasury. The Department of the Treasury has been quite successful in terms of taking over the responsibilities that Congress and the public should have in control. Yet in order for the American people to understand what this administration's fiscal policy really is, that is what we need to understand

Mr. Speaker, for the sake of clarification, there is no assumption in our budget resolution that any tax relief for small business is going to go away when the stimulus bill comes in from the administration and they are looking at how it might affect their own property tax bill in future years as it is written now and they know they have not had any health care bill passed so far this year. So they have not gone through all that work.  This budget resolution assumes that we will balance the budget with a flat tax that says everyone who needs tax relief gets that money back if they pay their tax bill before the time they get it and the burden is shared equally and then the burden is shared equally again when it comes time to vote on the tax bill. That is true in the President's budget as it is true in the Speaker's budget

A key result is that some of the generic manufacturers that produce the less expensive versions of newer, higher priced generic drugs are able to exploit markets that are most often dominated by similar gener

They have caused the financial markets to go into a tailspin and to be shut down for many weeks at a time because of the tremendous amounts of Federal funding that has gone to their economic policies and their tax cuts. These aren't the only economic issues the administration has caused, but it would be a mistake to continue to deal with them because we have to deal with a number of other issues and some of the things that have been said about the economy that are simply not true and will not help the people that need it the most.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, as they demonstrate, you can add up the CBO outlays--the spending of the Federal Government--for all of the years 1996 through 1999 and you will find that spending has increased by $300 billion. That $300 billion was accumulated by raising taxes on the American people and by slashing funding for Head Start and improving housing for seniors in our country and other programs. So it is not surprising that spending has increased by $300 billion in this country in fiscal year 1997, by $300 billion in fiscal year 1998, $300 billion in fiscal year 1999. So it is significant that spending has increased by $300 billion in fiscal year 1997 in this country. But to make up for this $300 billion growth, the deficit this year has increased to $5 trillion, of which the Treasury just reports that the deficit will be $9.

The poorest districts in the country will end up paying a premium for all of the transportation projects that we're proposing to do to improve highway access and opportunity for them.  You can see that there is no advantage in building highways to those areas that have the highest poverty rates in the country. We should be able to build highways in areas that have the least poverty rate in the country where people get access to the road more easily.   caveat emptor in effect in this budget is that there is no advantage in that opportunity. So in this budget if you have some advantage in the areas that have the highest poverty, you lose the opportunity to do that kind of investing in transportation where there is some the least poverty.  I support increasing funding to address the need for capital improvements in rural communities. I'm pleased that Mr

The American people have waited so long for justice to be done for what they have seen as one of the most serious and serious offenses ever to be attempted by this President to run the executive branch of Government in the United States. But they have waited too long for them to happen.  We have come a long way in this time, Mr. President, but when you look at the enormity of what has been perpetrated, how badly it has shaken the faith of the American people, you begin to understand how in the year 2006 we are still in the grip of a government that may at times seem out of control and beyond the ability of this body to

The majority of inflation in the United States comes from this rate of inflation. Even if the rate of inflation is reduced to 7 percent we will still see inflation of 7.5 percent in the year 2002. So there is no point in reducing the rate of inflation by this amount to help reach a goal that Congress will hopefully set in the 1996 budget resolution to have the rate of inflation as low as it can possibly reach.

I would like to again thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his leadership on this bill and the leadership of the chair of our committee, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton).

Why is it that the Republican leadership continues to filibuster this very important legislation as it moves through the Senate to be implemented in all 50 States on Tuesday of next week?  The leadership has turned its back on open debate and failure to address serious questions of public policy. Republicans continue to hold the major pieces of health care legislation hostage, including prescription drug coverage and new coverage for school-based health clinics. The majority does not want to hear the objections of the American people. It should have a law that will protect and improve health care coverage for the American people and the health care reform efforts that are

The language was not included in the 1996 bill but is still needed to evaluate the future of international family law reform in the United States and the effect on Federal judicial practice. The committee also needs to be informed of any anticipated legal reform plans in the State Department as well as the legal challenges which will come from a fundamental change in the international family law process in our Nation.

It was just not a good idea for anybody to have it in this country because there was no way they could say that we could ever keep it in our States because we did not have the kind of ownership that we have today and we

I hope the Prime Minister of Israel is supportive of this resolution, and I hope President Clinton will see the wisdom of this action and do the right thing.  I rise in support of the resolution before us.  I think it is a sad commentary that Israel is experiencing a diplomatic stalemate with Iran. I think the American people are being led astray.  While I am deeply troubled by Iranian behavior, I also recognize that I believe that Israel is among those countries with strong interests in Iran. We have mutual interests in Israel as well

Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 1994, legislation to allow the VA to design its own health care delivery system that can meet the unique needs of the veterans in our Nation today. This bill is an important step in improving our Nation's health care delivery system while also making sure that it is not hindered by Federal oversight.  I am pleased that this legislation includes a provision which will help the VA to better use the innovative practices and practices which have shown the potential for great savings for the Federal Government when it comes to the number of veterans and the quality of their health care. When compared to the present health care system the Government does not have the ability to collect better data on the performance of the health care providers who serve the veterans and the VA needs to use the best medical practices that have been developed.  This is

Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, amid concerns of hostile treatment against Israel at the United Nations, President Clinton invited two brave Israeli soldiers who would become the most high profile targets in the war for peace. The courageous soldiers would be allowed to return to Israel and to be reunited with their family and friends in a happy moment.  The criticism was harsh and relentless from this administration, but the courageous soldiers of B-52 and B-8 made their return without the treatment that Israel had feared and feared would happen to their family and friends. They made it through to their homeland to return to their loved ones without the hostile fire that would have followed them as they made their way home. Their home was their only hope.  While B-52's or B-8's fear a much greater retaliation in the past, this group of veterans

Mr. President, before I answer this question, there is one further response I want to make to the Senator from Utah that concerns me very much. This amendment also proposes to reverse a decision by the Democratic Party in 1993 to exclude the testimony of the city of Reno and the Reno Airport Commission from the congressional debates about the long-term importance of the Federal charter airport system. This amendment has no impact on the provisions in the constitutional amendment which clearly state that all Federal legislation shall be constitutional and enforceable by State courts of law. Moreover, this amendment does not violate the rule that no amendment relating to the operation of Federal Government be in order to the authorizing legislation for the proposed Federal charter airport legislation. In fact, Mr. President, it is the language of this amendment which actually makes it clear that no constitutional amendment will be in order.

Mr. President, I have had an opportunity now to review some of the restrictions on amendments offered on this bill on the subject of FDA regulation that have been worked out with Senator Dorgan and Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd and myself on behalf of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under legislation which we have introduced this year. Those restrictions include requirements that limits the Department of Health and Human Services authority to adopt regulations and rules for under-the-counter and non-prescription drugs. However, other restrictions imposed by Congress on the FDA, I think, are completely unnecessary.  The FDA regulations concerning interdiction of small, pesticide-resistant pests, or SOPs, particularly in animal feed produce negligible adverse results as compared to those to be expected in the field due to the new herbicide-resistant plant growth conditions encountered there.

This legislation will protect the health and well-being of American workers while providing the essential assistance to employees to improve the quality of their work and improve the lives of their families.  The Federal employee health care program serves over 44 million Americans who use it to reduce the number of health care visits and save the taxpayers more than $15 billion each year. Nearly all of these employees work in Government-wide, nonprofit health care programs serving civilians in the health care sector.  FERC's long-established policies of providing low cost insurance, strong access to health care for all Federal employees, strong maternity and paternity rights, and access to affordable primary care are all beneficial to all Americans.

But rather it is about whether to allow this administration to set the defense priorities of the United States based on our desire to be more politically liberal than to be more conservative.  Our focus in this bill is our defense needs, as well as our NATO allies and their defense priorities. I would say that the administration of our Secretary of Defense has done an excellent job of including our defense needs in a fairly balanced formula to work with our allies in the world.

This is an amendment that has the support of both Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Smith of the Agriculture Committee.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, I am a big proponent of increasing the production of America's food, but in recent years, one of the greatest problems facing America's farmers is the tax burden that they must carry for numerous State and local governments. The way the law currently works is if you are trying to ship two or more commodities or a kilogram of sugar, you pay the American farmer and then the American Government has to charge for it.

In doing so it gave America the first national plan to implement effective and sustained educational and literacy programs for children in rural communities and at all levels of education throughout the country. This legislation also set the goal of making education more than a matter of opportunity for our children. For years now, education reform has focused more on high-stakes performance than on basic American values and opportunities for our children. President Clinton's education reform bill, President Bush's proposals for reform, and the recent bipartisan agreement to focus on local education are aimed at addressing these important issues.  In my home State of Utah, for example, there are nearly 1,000 school districts. These districts of over 25,000 children in rural Utah administer primary, secondary, and adult education programs,

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital Improvement Act of 2003 that I introduced with my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Health Subcommittee. I want to commend the leadership of Chairman Knollenberg and ranking member Miller of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs for moving this important piece of legislation through the committee before its scheduled markup in the full Committee on Veterans' Affairs today and I would like to join them in extending my strong support for this legislation that will ensure that our facilities are modern and health care facilities can continue to provide the highest quality health care services to our veterans.  A recent study found that less than half of Federal veterans hospitals report average staffing rates that compare favorably to the U.S. average.

That has come about because we had the Tax Code in place. We did not have the jerry-built systems like we have in the United Kingdom and, believe me, because of the high tax burden, they have very few business transactions here in the United States, yet we get very, very few tax returns filed under those systems, virtually none.

Mr. President, it is not easy for me to rise against an amendment by Senator Wellstone that is completely flawed to my budget proposal. I believe that amendment is fatally flawed because it would eliminate $800 million in funding for the current budget resolution for what is likely to be a continuing resolution this year.  I would also like to speak about some of the specifics of that amendment. It would change tax provisions that would likely hurt Americans. A key provision would require tax returns filed by seniors and others who are taxpayers to be posted on the Internet for $50 for any tax return that is not filed by a regular mail returner for the year. So I think that is wrong. In my State of Massachusetts, Democrats and Republicans alike agree that when tax return returns are filed, they should be on the Internet, and taxpayers should have

Right now some 40 States have the right to take out student loans for their students and their children without having a student income tax liability. That is right. We can have student loan debt as high as $1 million for children of students with no student income tax liability for that young person who wants to get their education because they graduated from school. They take out student loans and the parents have to cover that student's student loans because they are not making enough money for that child to go to school.  That is wrong. That is wrong. I think parents should not have to cover that young person's student loans in order to make their life work.  I think this is an important vote, and I think we are making a big mistake with this amendment.

With respect to the strategy to bring India into the MPT, in our considered judgment, we believe India can and should be taken as a partner for all of its economic policy issues but as a constructive and constructive partner for our own security issues as well. We believe that India needs the help of the international community and Congress. We want to make sure that that assistance is in some way considered as a necessary part of that strategy. India needs help on maritime issues. The world has a strategic interest in helping India in addressing maritime issues. We have some of that already--southwest Asia, the Spratly Islands, Cuba, northern Europe, Central Asia. We need to acknowledge India's own contribution in addressing those issues, not just its own interest.  Second, our staffs have worked closely with the Indian Foreign Minister's office to

But I would point out that when they go through the Medicaid program, because they are the most populous of the States that are covered by Medicaid, many of those people go on to go on to private insurance and have a premium that exceeds the cost of the program that they are in right now, and that is the problem with that whole thing. We need to allow people to have choice. This is not about money for no money. This is about choice for people to get out of the current system that has gotten them into this, and I think that we should allow that to happen and then use the changes that will come with it as we move into a more comprehensive approach to

Our bill creates an independent, bipartisan commission to look at the extensive uses of the barrel bombs and other unconventional weapons around the world. While it is not possible to predict all types of theater use in Iraq, most of our existing intelligence support can be done on the basis of a number of sources that may be inconsistent with the war in Iraq.  Our bill also authorizes the President to issue directives to the Secretary of Defense and other heads of the Armed Forces to share information on barrel bomb use, arms manufacturing, and proliferation. This would provide important information on an emerging threat to our national security interests. It would ensure that we have the best

I also fear that the actions of some in Congress will lead to greater deficits in order to fund other priorities that I agree with. Even with the cuts, I am deeply concerned that we are going to continue to see budget deficits over the long-term.

The amendment would allow Department of Agriculture funds to be provided to help cover the cost of Federal study projects on the establishment of the National Wetlands Assessment Program. The program was initiated by Congress in 1984 to direct the administration to prepare the ecological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic evaluation and management of National Wetlands. The program was expanded in 1987 to a model which allows the Government to hire locally driven environmental consultant to assess the cultural and recreational value of the wetlands.  While the current model provides that studies be submitted to a Federal review board for administrative review, no board has met for nearly two decades.

I want to thank my colleagues from Minnesota and other colleagues on the other side of the aisle for doing such a good job of explaining their differences on the legislation here. This issue is complex and some of the changes that we have heard about in this debate are obviously difficult and going to be very difficult for this Nation's businesses. The majority of these American small business owners are in the business of putting the needs of their employees ahead of their own bottom lines and that is what this legislation will provide them with. I think it is a good bill and I hope the House will give it consideration and vote for it. I have said I will not be supporting the bill. I am concerned about what has been done in this bill by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that has been not

Over the past decade in the West, we have lost over 2.5 billion barrels of oil every day due to overproduction in the oil and gas industry. We have watched as our Government takes more and more of the savings we take from the oil and gas industry and then put it into the Federal Government to fund and spend. Now we find that this Government also has the ability to spend the money that we have already taken from them and to spend it any way they want to this country and the world is becoming even more dependent on the

Mr. Speaker, it has been 1 year since House Republicans stood on the west front of Capitol Hill and stood up for the citizens of this great Nation and the citizens of the First Congressional District of Georgia. There is nothing the Republicans did that was anything less than right that they did this year, and it is time for us to do something different for the future of this great Nation and this great Nation's people. So I am here this morning to explain why this should be the focus of the year for this Congress. We must take action to make the lives of every American better and more secure. These words come from the book ``The Story of Our Lives,'' by Eleanor Roosevelt, as we speak this morning and have been for more than a decade that I think we should focus on this week and the one that follows this week to

I think that the President would be asked to come to the floor to answer this question and to say he had all of the cards to balance the budget on his back.

There would be no impoundment authority under this balanced budget amendment. Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment was adopted as a joint resolution, as a statement of policy and strategy. It is my view that it has no such distinction, that there would not be any impoundment authority under this balanced budget amendment as provided for in the provision in the resolution itself. It is my view, however, that section 303(a) of the Senate Joint Resolution contains no requirement or limitation of impoundment authority under this amendment and this section. I think it is an erroneous reading of the Senate Joint Resolution in that sense. Section 303(a) of the Senate Joint Resolution, as it is interpreted by this amendment, does not appear to require the expenditure of one-half of a general fund appropriation to pay a deficiency in a

This was not the last vote that was on this appropriations bill. We have still not come to the end of the fiscal year. We still have $1 billion less to spend on the Federal Government than we did this year on the most important domestic programs which would have been our responsibilities if this bill had passed without our action today and if we had not done this today.

This week the United States and our allies in Europe and the United Nations confirmed that the great problem with Russia's aggression against Ukraine is their military buildup in areas that they have occupied over the last year. The war on the Second Baltic Republic and the war in Georgia followed by a new war in Ukraine are another example of the post-cold-war order that has only pushed Russia in the wrong direction. The new approaches are undermining the ability of the European Union to work together in a way that would benefit all of its members and all of Europe's people in a way that would not affect NATO.

And the reason we want to do that is because the American people are against this tax cut for the top 1 percent of Americans.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, H.R. 2551, the Red Tape Reduction Act of 1997, represents another step in Federal agency reform that will reduce the amount of paperwork we have to comply with on behalf of the public through the implementation of new and creative law enforcement programs and the creation of a new kind of State enforcement operation within the Department of Justice, all in order to eliminate the waste, fraud, and abuse that is so critical to the American people.  This bill is a first step in making Federal agencies more efficient and effective in responding to a massive number of traffic violations that come to their attention every year. In my view, this effort is in the national interest and we need it.  In the past few years Federal agencies and the attorneys general of their States

The Government Accountability Office has long recognized the need for significant and permanent changes in veterans health care facilities. Recently, the GAO completed an independent study of VA facilities that determined that more than 5,700 VA outpatient and emergency medical facilities have been chronically inadequate for the care of veterans.

Mr. President, the strength of my State of Iowa lies in its vibrant local communities, and rural communities are often more valuable than larger cities or States such as California. So as we work to restore the way our local schools are structured to address the needs of our rural youth, we have a responsibility to make sure that their communities have more quality public schools that serve all children. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, I rise to support a bill sponsored by Senator Grassley, Senator Hutchison, Senator Grassley's wife, Senator Grassley's daughter, Senator Grassley's son, Senator Grassley's daughter-in-law, Senator Grassley's husband, Senator Grassley's business partner, Senator Grassley's legal counsel, Senator Grassley's fellow in the Senate, Senator Grassley's law student, Senator

Well, this week in the House, I will introduce the Jobs and Manufacturing Tax Relief Act to help those people who, during this peak of this economy, are trying to be part of the job growth of this country.

The Senator from West Virginia raises an excellent question. Again, I stress that what our statute calls the amendment process of this particular measure is not what the Senator would be calling for is the minority or the independent counsel. As I understand it, it would be subject to the rule of law that would allow for an independent counsel to go to the committee that could maybe investigate questions that were raised and there is a report that is sent to the floor and there can be a chance for the minority to review and question that report and the opportunity for the independent counsel to go to the committee to do his job. So I understand his interest in not relying on a supermajority because I understand his concern that we are not being able to carry out our constitutional responsibility to investigate and to get to the truth, but I certainly respect his interest in trying to

Our Constitution requires judicial confirmation and it also requires that the people have confidence in our judiciary.

This bill does nothing to undermine our military readiness. Rather, the military construction bill offers a grant to the State of Illinois to help the military prevent the ``comeback period'' from starting on the bill. A quarter of the funding that would be used for the bill is not needed by the State of Illinois to prevent the ``comeback period'' from starting on this bill. In fact, the only thing that is needed to protect our troops from the ``comeback period'' is to be willing to approve the State of Illinois to use the entire $6.9 million that is appropriated to

Mr. Speaker, yesterday's decision by President Bush to escalate the U.S. troop commitment in Iraq makes good sense and gives us time to turn our focus to the security of Iraq in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11th.  The Army Corps of Engineers has issued a set of preliminary findings that they think support a timeline for withdrawal of troops from Iraq by the end of next year. This comes on the heels of the Army Corps finding that the coalition military operation is going well and that this means that there is no need to send additional troops in the coming year or to pull troops from Iraq by the end of next year. This clearly demonstrates that the progress we are seeing is simply the result of hard work and will not undermine our efforts to successfully fight terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Let me conclude by saying these three Assistant Secretaries should remain Senate-confirmed, Presidential appointees. I think that there is no reason that that should be the case. Let's get some help with the recruiting and retention process and with the evaluation and bringing to a conclusion the foreign operations nominations in the Defense Department that should be made in this regard. That is what the committee will do, and I think that the majority leader has made it clear that this will be the focus and priority of this week and of next week and the week after that as well in terms of what we have to do and the Government we have to get control of and bring to a conclusion to the Defense Department. I urge all Members to support the request of the Democratic leader that we do this in a bipartisan way to achieve that objective of a better Government. And we will get

Mr. President, today the Federal Reserve Board will meet, as always, in secret. These folks, the people that make policy that is up to all of us--they have never issued a letter warning us of the coming default and the trillion dollar deficits that we could face if we don't take action to come up with a plan to reduce those deficits and make the Federal Government more solvent.  I don't blame the Fed for that. The Fed is a policymaking body, not a monetary policymaking body. If we did have a serious policy debate in the Fed, there would have been hundreds of comments and debate on the Fed's comment letters. The Fed doesn't even have to publish any of its comments. It is a Government agency, and it makes its policy decisions in secret. If the Fed wants to just raise interest rates and impose

That is how much he does not want to see that level of concentration of money into our elections. That is what the American people want from this Congress. That is what the American people need for this House of Representatives to do its job to hold people accountable on issues that affect their health, their quality of life, and their standard of living. It is past time that this House and this Congress does its job for the people of the United States of America. And do you know what the American people do not want you to do?

Throughout this Congress we have taken important steps to help restore security and to assist those who were affected by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

We have done a good job of that in the Energy and Commerce Committee over the years. That program is very important to working in this country because of the fact that there are thousands of industries that are not being able to get basic services because of the lack of funding for infrastructure.

Mr. Speaker, the President said ``Wisconsin has the makings of a solid, bold welfare reform plan that just about everybody here believes will work,'' and Wisconsin has had the benefit of that welfare reform plan and has been successful in doing it, particularly in the last few years when people have gotten out of welfare. That has been a success story in a period of drastic fiscal cuts, and welfare reform is a way for the government to get out of the way of people and get people back into work.  I was interested, when we heard that President Clinton might have vetoed that welfare reform plan, and I know many people in Wisconsin like to hear that, because in many cases they are right. In other words, this is a good bill. This is a good bill because it was brought forward on time, was introduced in a manner that ensured

Now that the House of Representatives will be voting on this constitutional amendment and on that constitutional amendment will be the result of our deliberations here in the Congress, I think we have a responsibility to clarify that what we are doing is not only to make our tax cuts permanent, but also to address the drastic cuts that were made in the current social security system in the 1950's and 1960's.

I am reminded of Sarah's simple yet powerful story because of how her accomplishments as a young woman helped shape a Nation which was on the path to full and open election to women. She knew from a very early age that she wanted to serve her country in the armed services, and she joined the Marines as an

Mr. Chairman, as on original consideration of this legislation by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure last month, there were no amendments offered or accepted by this House to this measure which will accomplish a goal that all Members have in mind and which I will speak about today.  I first want to commend the chairman and the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for the ability that they have used to find a compromise on the underlying legislation which was very difficult to get to on a partisan basis. The chairman and ranking member have wisely used their committee in order to craft a bill which provides significant funding for the next 10 years and which will maintain the status quo and which will help us to move to a new transportation policy in this Nation. So I want to commend both of them for the leadership

I would like to have the authority to go ahead and expand to ensure that we have no shortfall at all, which would ensure that this is not the true budget year in which we might have to use the line-item veto to not go ahead and use this line-item for other areas. But I think if we look at the problems we have as opposed to these other three areas that are still open under the program, they will continue to receive support.

Today, we witness a growing effort to do something about this issue. This bill, H.R. 1279, is one measure that will help encourage the Army to adopt a new plan to fund the war on our veterans and their families. It is important that we give an increase to the Department of Veterans Affairs to assist them in continuing to work to improve the quality of health care and services to our veterans. The bill would increase VA payments in the area of veterans' expenses by $1 billion over the next 5 years in order to help alleviate a growing bill.

I was particularly concerned that the Senate has not been afforded an opportunity to review the bill's proposed regulatory reform proposal before it passed the Senate Finance Committee on September 15 and passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote of 54 to 43. I believe this bill should be sent back to the Finance Committee for further hearings and amendment so that the public can have a full and fair debate on the legislation.

In the early 1970s, the Air Force decided it needed a better way to do what some considered to be more work than is involved in flying the planes which fly today. They needed a more efficient way to fly them than what is allowed today by commercial airlines. One of the reasons it took so long for them to do so was because they thought if they did not require commercial airlines to fly over the same airspace that commercial aircraft are allowed to fly over, they could take advantage of that airspace for more business for their flight crews and for their customers than commercial aircraft are allowed to take advantage of today. This important decision required the work of many people in the Air Force and other Government agencies to arrive at that objective and do so successfully

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher] on this question of the recognition of the right of the people to organize their own governments on a national level. That is what the National Right to Organize has been trying to do here on the floor of the House for the last two Congresses. We hope to be able to take up that amendment again this week to deal with this important issue in this new Congress. But this is a bill that certainly ought to be bipartisan. We should be able to move forward and try to end the Government shutdown and to avoid the type of situations that the Government may face in the future where the government may go broke in just a few days or a few weeks time.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, which recently completed its seventh year of giving students the opportunity to pursue a distinguished career in the health care industry.  The Union of National Students of the University of the Health Sciences (UNUHS) has provided students of all ages the opportunity to combine science with industry. For some members of UNUHS, it is not enough simply to seek employment in medical technology. UNUHS members are well equipped to go beyond medical experience and complete advanced degrees in a variety of fields. Students of UNUHS have an unrivaled background in the areas of computer science, electrical engineering, computer engineering, mathematics, and materials engineering. Many graduate with B.A.s and M.D.s. For their dedication to the field of health care

But the amendment I am proposing today that is being offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Forger] would have done two very important things. It would have opened an important part of Federal water rights to protect and the need to allow private entities to develop to provide the water for use in the State. Also, it would have provided an important local aspect to the authorization of the River Act that would help to preserve a valuable part of the area and the ability for future generations to utilize it. So I am very supportive of the amendment of the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Forger], and I urge all Members to support it.   oppressively dicky

Madam President, a recent study from Harvard suggested that the actual death toll in Puerto Rico due to the massive disaster the island has suffered has been as high as 21 percent. That is the number of Puerto Rican people that have died since the storm hit. That means 21 percent of the victims have already lost their lives since the storm hit. That means that 1,771 people in Puerto Rico have died in that flood that took its toll on the region.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it will take years to rebuild the island. The EPA estimates the cost of rebuilding the storm zone to be $6.7 billion. There is a high likelihood that FEMA is underestimating the need and actually cutting it by even more, which is likely just as dangerous.  FEMA says that it has over 200 steps, from contracting out flood

Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the use of funds in the Department of Defense for ongoing efforts to support an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in response to the recent oil spill in the north gulf in June of this year. The amendment would also require the Department of Defense to provide the President with any additional information necessary to determine the extent of the environmental damage and the health risks of the environment associated with the spill that has already occurred in Louisiana and Mississippi.  The Federal Government has a responsibility to provide all appropriate and necessary Federal assistance to the region that is directly affected by this spill and many other large spills that occur every day. A recent release of oil in the middle of a national freshwater spring in Louisiana clearly illustrates the importance of this approach and the need to carefully consider

This Congress must come together and do all we can to bring the economy back to health and restore confidence in the American people, which the Speaker said we needed to do last year.  Now more than ever it is critically important that we rebuild the confidence of our people to create the jobs that are needed and create new opportunities for them.

Madam Speaker, America's confidence in our electoral system has suffered an egregious blow this cycle. Polls show that voters across the country oppose Democratic efforts to raise the minimum wage and want Congress to act now to address this crisis.  Last week, Republicans first tried to raise the minimum wage at a vote of 197-201 in the House of Representatives. This vote was not a resounding vote for minimum wage, but the unanimous vote in favor of raising the minimum wage under an open process is not good enough for Republicans in this Chamber or their billionaire donor donors.  This week, Senate Republicans followed the lead of the House and actually voted to raise the minimum wage through a closed process. This makes Republican efforts to raise the minimum wage a complete sham. Despite this evidence, the Republicans continue to be willing to shut out regular order in this Chamber

The sponsors of this provision had the good sense to include language in the bill which I intended to see deleted because it would have made it more difficult for States to receive the assistance in this bill.  I am not familiar with the language of this provision that I would like to see deleted. That paragraph

Mr. President, just one comment further. It is my understanding that the figure is the figure from the Department of the Interior, and it may be the President's figure from the Department of Defense for the same. But I would submit that all of these numbers come from the Department of Defense. I was wondering if the Senator would respond to that.  The  Humans Assistance and Training program, the effect of this is that it is that no funds will be used to support enhanced human skills training for prisoners of war to train that they will be so mentally retarded that they cannot accomplish their jobs as military guards for their U.S. military troops. It is quite obvious that this provision has no defense impact because the Department of Defense is clearly concerned about the situation of the prisoners of war from other countries who are being treated improperly by the State

The major issue we discussed is the idea of family friendly health insurance for all Americans. Many of my colleagues have worked hard for years to do that. Senator Thomas, who I met yesterday on the Capitol steps, has worked with me to see what can be done to help create family-friendly policies. I recently received a letter from a family from California. The letter says, ``Dear Senator Thomas, Our children are now in their sixth year and we have had two very healthy kids--hooray!

In fact, that funding has only been decreased in recent years through budget-neutral allocations for the Federal Science Fund.  In this bill, the Department of Defense makes the decision whether to fund or not fund the National Science Foundation. Funds for that fund would instead flow to the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers, a majority of which would then be spent to support research in areas in the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers that are of national importance and that help inform us in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer's, and other costly medical costs.

Well, we have an agreement with the Secretary of State that we do not require the Secretary of State to provide any kind of advice for the President on the approval of travel to any country where sanctions are being imposed against those who are sponsoring terrorist activities. For this reason, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 authorizes the Secretary of State to provide such advice as required by section 501 of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. But the provision concerning the Security Council Resolution on President Bush has nothing to do with this authorization and does not really make it permissible for a State to provide any advice to the President regarding travel to any

The provisions which the majority is seeking to eliminate in the conference report would be a major change which is contrary to the longstanding congressional position on the poor and welfare States.

Frankfort is a small town in South Dakota surrounded by towering, rolling hills and pines. The town's small size and isolation have enabled Frankfort to forge a strong sense of community and devotion to its citizens. The residents of Frankfort are simply living their best days in a very special environment.  Frankfort started as a meetinghouse and restaurant for the community and now is a thriving center of commerce, government, and artistic activities. This special quality has allowed the community to thrive, and I believe that it is because of its spirit that Frankfort was chosen to receive the Department of Homeland Security designation.  Since the dawn of the Federal Government, Frankfort has welcomed refugees from all over the world.

In April of this year the Committee on the Judiciary, the other body of Congress, met with Chinese officials who have expressed serious concern that the Chinese Government is not treating those who are victims of forced labor with the level of respect and attention that they deserve from all Americans.  In August of last year, the Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on the situation in China with President Clinton, the Secretary of State

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 273, which recognizes and honors the First Sunday in June as the Year of the Horse in the United States Congress and the Year of the Great White Heifer in Montana. This resolution was adopted by the House Agriculture Committee with an amendment by the House Rules Committee which I authored to the House rules and the text of the amendment which was also adopted by the Agriculture Committee and the full committee of the House.  In many ways the year of the horse has a special meaning for me and this is one of the reasons I am a leader in this House in terms of stopping American export subsidies to Japan for the production of horses. The rider in the bill that is before the House is a provision that will make it illegal for a United States entity to use its market or financial influence to promote

It has been 2 days and 2 days and 2 days with the hearing. I would not say there has been an error, but let us give it one more chance. I know there

Mr. Chairman, my amendment today aims to protect private property rights of farmers and ranchers by requiring USDA to complete the implementation of the intent of the Trade Act of 1974 and the prior administrative statute, with recommendations on the reduction of farms that otherwise would be exported and other issues raised by agriculture and forestry employees.  The House has recognized the unique agricultural trade challenges of Congress and the need for consistent Federal policy to provide sound protection to those interests that are under agricultural challenges in every sector of the economy. In 2000, in the context of this bill, we amended the 1996 farm bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to collect royalties on farmland; provided for processing duties on agricultural products sold in retail stores; and required agriculture-related industries to disclose their sources of earned revenue. The farm bill language that the House adopted in 2001 also amended the M

I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their cooperation and support on this issue, and especially for allowing the Appropriations Committee to consider an amendment to prevent this line to be inadvertently extended in the future. I would like to thank also the subcommittee and full committee staff for their efforts to put this matter in the proper context.

It would be a win for the Members of the House who are in a position that the deal that they have been negotiating for many months now has turned out to be a win for us in terms of what we are trying to achieve here in Congress and what is in the best interests of the State of Texas.  It would be a win for the Secretary of Education to have this agreement in effect, and that would be a win for the administration of the bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I would like to thank the ranking member for his commitment to help improve our Nation's security.  This amendment would remove the cost-free provision in the bill, which effectively limits the amount of funding that can be obligated for national security specific training and operations projects.  I would like to explain to my colleagues the type of technology that can be used to enable these programs to move forward.  As we know, there are thousands of airports across the country that need to be modernized and modernized quickly. There are currently no national training centers that can serve as the training stations for these security vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, these programs are noncost

This is the issue of taxpayer funds. We hear a lot of rhetoric, as I know my friend from New Hampshire likes to do, and I am pleased he can put forward a proposal for increasing money that is so important to America, but it is really a consumer issue that deals with issues of the health of the American people. We hear a lot of rhetoric about consumer protection and about creating a balanced budget, but it is really a consumer issue as well and we all know how important it is that people understand that some of these dollars go to R&D and other things that consumers are

Mr. Chairman, we want to be sure that this is going to protect the health of our seniors and others who will benefit from it if we decide to extend this to go even further back into the next century. I think that this amendment is important for the future of our Nation because it would prevent any further consolidation of health care. So this is certainly a good first step. But it is not a perfect thing to do because we have some people on this side of the aisle who would simply use this opportunity to say we have to use a drastic amount of money to fund these new accounts for people who have preexisting conditions

This bill, the one that is going to come before us tomorrow, will extend the tax cuts that President Bush has proposed in 2003 for the wealthiest Americans and for special interests that he has pushed in the tax bill he has brought forward for us today. The reason I have done that is because he has provided for the highest tax cuts in history and given those tax cuts to the wealthiest people in this country. This bill that we are going to consider in just a few moments will extend the tax cuts that President Bush has proposed for the wealthiest people in the country for the next five years. That is the problem. If this bill is adopted, it will cut taxes for everybody in the country and it will give more tax cuts to people earning over
