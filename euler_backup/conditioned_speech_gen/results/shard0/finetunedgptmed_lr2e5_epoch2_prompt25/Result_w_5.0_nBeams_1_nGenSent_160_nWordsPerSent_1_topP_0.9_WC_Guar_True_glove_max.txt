Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I speak in opposition to this amendment. One of the statements by the proponent of the amendment suggests that this bill will be the law of the land by end of the decade or the year 2002 or some such date. If that is so then Chairman Thompson should back up his claims with numbers which show the agency could not come to any conclusion and report back to the House by now within a year or two and it would be too late to do anything about it because they have already given coverage to banks under this law.  I do not believe that is the case. If it were true that this provision would be mandatory under this law, it would be permissible under the law, but it does not; it would be exempt. We are talking about telling insurance companies that they can have coverage as long as they provide that coverage when they apply for insurance under this law.  The

Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, in Congress we are working on giving Americans an $85 billion tax cut. The question is who should reap the benefits of this success. We have to start with the American people or America will not pay for all the Republican promises that they made a few years ago when we promised the Nation we would balance the budget in 7 years. The Republicans say they want to give America a balanced budget.  But why not start with the American people first? You heard the majority leader last week say he and the majority leader thought that American families did not deserve a tax break that was twice as large as the benefit they already had, which is $10,000, and that is with their kids' and with their parents' money.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In fact, Latinos are a distinct group of Americans who hail from five continents, along with their European, Asian, Arab, and African roots. Millions of Latino Americans have found their way into the legal, manufacturing, business, and media fields, including in the food, music, education, travel, finance, and film industries.

As a matter of fact, in the Presidential race of 1972, Bill Clinton was only the first person to be nominated by the Democratic House of Representatives to serve as President of the United States when the American people came out in overwhelming numbers for him and voted for him over his opponents by a margin of 62 to 37 percent. And so as a matter of fact, the record would show that history would also be the very first time that people care about health care.  The vast majority of people across this country, I would suggest, do not want any of our proposals, I would suggest, to cut Medicare. That is why we have begun this effort to work with Senator Boxer to negotiate with Members of the House of Representatives.

Nationwide, the COPS program has been invaluable in trying to help officers in law enforcement break the cycle of crime and increase the safety of both the law enforcement community and the residents they protect in our neighborhoods.  However, for those neighborhoods that grant the COPS program a grant in Washington State, they are not received as grants for performance in Michigan and in the State as a whole. In fact, the COPS program's purpose is almost impossible to achieve. This is because the COPS program is funded by funding by State and local law enforcement agencies for general Federal spending to be carried out through programs for people who have fallen in the line of duty. This formula has proved to be unworkable, so the recipients have been asked to foot the bill for the program to ``sustain itself.''  This system has been

Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 658 as it currently stands. While I support a long-term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, this bill should not be put into effect without proper consideration by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and other relevant agencies. This bill would cut by half the amount of air traffic controllers to ensure safety on our aviation systems. It would severely restrict FAA safety programs by imposing new prohibitions on the use of locally contracted, but highly skilled workers. This bill would cut the FAA's research and development budget by 28 percent, leaving no certainty for those not yet training for their positions in years to come. H.R. 658 would hinder the FAA's ability to handle the growing backlog of aircraft certification requests and jeopardize FAA safety efforts in virtually every state in the Union. Moreover, this bill would create a major backlog in our TSA screening of passengers by imposing a five-tier security screening procedure, requiring that TSA immediately post

Mr. President, 3 years ago, the country of Belarus held a presidential election that marked--instead of finally joining the rest of democratic Europe--a brutal crackdown on political opposition. Those unfortunate citizens who chose to cast their ballots in Belarus as the new Soviet KGB sought to undermine the collective will of the Belarusian people, few people have been able to hold their breath.  Belarusians answered their fellow citizens' desperate cries for democratic reform by rejecting the pro-Western Yeltsin. Instead, they have dared their own people to rise up against an oppressive, militarized KGB, and those who dared stand in opposition now face further persecution and brutalizing curfews.

It has now been very, very clear. Speaker Gingrich is giving a sneak preview to his new role as a former lobbyist, a group that makes a living on bribery. Now, of course, the Attorney General of the United States has joined in his mockery, in his ridicule of the President's Federal criminal investigatory powers, and we are still here.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3179, ``Empowering Students through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act,'' which amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide students with assistance to help them achieve financial independence and secure their future.  In this country, nearly one in five adults and one in six children will not meet the current cost of attending college or earn a college degree in the next 2 years because of a lack of aid. After years of historic and historic increases in Federal financial aid, higher education and savings, our economic security is deeply damaged. College is the key to more opportunities for the future.  In America, one in five working families with children attend college, and this program will provide an income to assist many of them to do so.

This year's Labor Day has come to represent a renewed spirit of common purpose and shared sacrifice and, of course, the tremendous advances in the quality of life that American workers and their families have already witnessed in their lifetime.

Mr. Chairman, they recommended this lab lose its status as a federally funded research and development center, a condition that allows it to receive government funds and that makes it eligible for several grant programs in the government account. The status quo is unacceptable. The Office of Technology Assessment, and the full Federal Government lab program is not exempt from these same basic guidelines and basis for the Federal contribution to these programs because they all operate on an as yet unobligated federal appropriation for each year spent in the authorization.  The amendment that is before the House now is an amendment that will enable the Department of Energy and our Federal partners, including the Advanced Materials Research Council, to work through a process to change that. It is an amendment that will allow the long-term fiscal stability of these two programs that are so critically important to our national energy policy.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, it has become clear that our health care debate is entering the twilight zone. We have such a challenge in this Nation of limiting the growth of Government and the expansion of Federal Government that we really need to start over and not only go back and do it over again but also take this difficult step of looking at the real long-term impact of this debate to make it more than simply the same old same old. That is why I rise today in support of the United States Children's Health Insurance Program which has been targeted more than anything else for reauthorization for many years now because it provides coverage and benefits to millions of children and businesses across the country.  I don't know why the Republican Party has chosen to come down to the American people and talk about this now, but I do know why they are talking about it now. If they believe in it, they will fight hard and invest in this program.

Mr. Speaker, tonight the President will give the State of the Union Message. The American people have learned that it is not what the President says but how it is delivered that determines the political mood of this nation and ultimately how it will affect health care in this country.  In this speech, the President says it is ``common sense'' that it would be ``counter-productive for anyone to argue that this bill cannot or should not be enacted or the crime bill cannot or should not be passed, and he seems to think this is a formula for change.''  To that he adds, ``I agree. I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues to pass something that can pass both Houses of Congress. And I know that they will make sure it will work as well.''  If the President truly believes that ``saying what is reasonable is the same as if it were a lie,'' then he needs to be honest with us.

Mr. Speaker, Democrats like tax cuts, too, but the Democratic Party's tax policies are targeted to do the most good for the majority of Americans. In addition to tax cuts, Democrats include three progressive programs that make a real difference in the lives of American families and small business owners across this country. First is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1997 that will allow workers up to 12 weeks to be with a new or a family member if the new or a family member has a major party birth or adoption. No more carrying one's own baby all over town.  Also, the bipartisan Family Business Health Fairness Act gives American business owners control over their health care delivery system. This is especially important to small business owners who have been without the capability to meet health care needs. Currently small business employers are given a health care delivery system to negotiate with their employees, which results in very expensive and unsuccessful health care services.

That remaining time will be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees and the time under the control of the minority will be used for debate only minutes after 12 noon on the one remaining judicial nomination on the list that is being considered on the Senate floor next week. That will be the first vote that will take place this morning on the action of the Senate before we turn to the supplemental appropriations bill.  Additional rollcall votes will occur throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate. Rollcall votes will occur as they are called. The first vote tomorrow will be the Levin amendment No. 2108. There will be a final vote between 12:30 and 2:15 p.m. on that

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Goss amendment. The amendment offered by my good friend from Florida [Mr. Goss] complements action we have already taken this year on this very important issue. This amendment would strike all language in the bill to subject any consideration of any financial information request that is made under section 1341(a)(1)(C) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to secrecy by the parent company or the designated financial agent.  This is a Federal issue and should be dealt with in the Senate where we have a wide-ranging and active debate and where the Florida congress has passed measures against this very problem in recent years.  It is essential that the SEC do its job--its job--by ensuring that the information obtained in connection with private investigative subpoenas is made public. We must make it clear that not only does this information have to be made public but that the SEC cannot wait on the response from

He enrolled in the Montanan Master Public Administration program in 1997 and rose quickly through the ranks in the event management profession and his leadership experience. He later went on to earn his bachelor of arts degree from the University of Montana in mathematics and his master of science in information systems from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. During his career, he has continued to actively participate in his community and military, serving in many different areas of interest over the years.

He is a gentleman who knows what he is talking about. I have no problem with his work because he brings an idea that will improve and perhaps even make the laws better by putting small fishermen out of business. We have fishing cooperatives in my district. They are working very hard to fight these small fishermen so that we do not ever forget about them.  Mr. Chairman, as I have read the amendment that is before us, if anything this amendment is not the pork of big fishermen, it is small fishermen. It does not have the pork to put over at the Federal level. What it does have is a piggyback on the Legal Services Corporation for additional money and say, you see, there are going to be a lot of small fishing vessels.

transportation federal race 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today to pose an important question to this House, and that question is this: Do we really need an independent Federal Bureau of Investigation? One of the reasons we have such a big federal budget is because the Department of Justice and the other agencies in the federal Government do not do their jobs when it comes to the protection of the American public from the bad guys and the transportation of our national secrets.  The only thing that is more dangerous to the American people than a lack of an independent and so-called government watchdog is the fact that we have had this race to the bottom between the public good, the national security, the intelligence and the law enforcement interests. This race to the bottom has resulted in our people's safety being placed at risk in over 6,000 ways, for example, through our transportation, through our mail, through our health care system.

They offered us solutions that were on our minds. They put forward ideas that we have been supporting, something that is good for our economy, that we are very interested in.  And we know that the party leadership is working very diligently, and we feel like we are on the verge of completing action on a very important piece of legislation, and that is, in fact, an extension of a provision that was approved by a bipartisan vote. So that is something we are all very interested in. I think this is an actionable piece of legislation that will

He has been a strong and consistent opponent of other early termination provisions that have come out of this bill that had no workable workers verification system. It is as simple as that.

The Senator from Pennsylvania on the other hand would ask all of us here to make these tax cuts permanent, because it is an economic imperative and something that creates jobs in this country. That makes it difficult to compromise and to find our common ground. This proposal I think meets that test. It is an opportunity to make sure we meet that test. The public has confidence that we are keeping the promises that we made when we took office. The deficit is below its trend line. We believe we have made substantial progress. I think it is the right thing to do, to have a transition plan that is going to have some people come back and maybe reinvigorate and revitalize the economy. It is not a sense of impropri

These deadlines are out of step with how many of the reports I have seen regarding corruption manipulation and abuse in Iraq since I came to this body.  The bottom line is we know for a fact that a number of important benchmarks were breached by the U.S. in 2002, 2003, and 2004. However, there are things we do not know.

He has certainly done his homework and worked through the committee in a very positive way. And now this committee chairman has brought out a budget resolution which is in opposition to the budget resolution that has already been presented here to the Senate for approval by the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee can then make its budget budget if it would deficit neutral in the event of a budget deficit that exceeded $400 billion.  Now if there is going to be a budget deficit in excess of $400 billion trillion, there is a going-to-balance requirement that goes to $500 billion or $600 billion. If that is the case, then the point of order would lie against the Budget Resolution. So I welcome that.  It will be at least a

His leadership has helped Vladimir Putin's government drive a market cap of over $3 billion in 2010 and $16 billion in 2011 alone. Putin also controls Russia's Central Bank and has moved to block free and fair free and fair trade in Pennsylvania.  Mr. Chairman, it is not just investors who stand to lose. Mr. Putin is reportedly backing an international boycott of coal investments in Ukraine. This kind of extreme economic ideology is not an option for the United States.

I would hope that we would agree to have a floor on that minimum wage of $5.15 an hour which was an 18 year experience of working in the home after June 30 1994 when I was 16 years old in February of 1995.   CPB was not out of the post office at the time that that happened and my colleagues were denied the opportunity to actually listen to what my family told me. Many people got up and said, well, you should not speak about that because it was you who helped the President. What was it like when you heard the President say during the 1992 campaign that he wanted to cut the Federal check to people on food stamps, and then the President put on his bus driver

I see colleagues of mine in the gallery and I hear people in this body that are making statements, but let's define what this amendment does so that people are not confused.  This amendment simply simply simply eliminates arbitrary caps and potentially puts a cap on the number of exempt organizations from the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, SBA, a program that we rely on to allow entrepreneurs to be able to start a small business. This amendment allows them to have it at the 11th hour, the last minute, and have it be exempted in the opportunity costs of this program. We have said in this House and we have repeated on this floor that

This is not a question of shutting down the Government today; this is a question about our ability to come to terms with who we are and what our priorities are. It is not a question of shutting down the Government tomorrow. What we should be doing is identifying priorities to begin to take care of the priorities of this country. What we should be doing is moving this country forward. What we should be doing is slowing the rate of inflation so that people can have more control of their own future. What we should be doing is talking about how we will handle the deficit. We should not be in that position.  The priorities

We are all operating under that, and the implication from what the Government is saying is that somehow Medicare and its benefit program is going to go out of balance. The Government in Washington is saying, ``It is going to get out of balance.''  The other option is we are going to have a very dramatic cut in the benefit that seniors and people with disabilities are going to receive in Medicare.

However, not all Democrats agree that we need to stimulate this economy and put Americans back to work and get our fiscal house in order so that we have the economic political parties supporting the best of Washington ways to deal with the problems we face in this country. The No Tax Hike For Working Americans Act will help delay taxes for middle class Americans who earn between $30,000 and $75,000.  For years, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that ``this is government for the middle class,'' arguing that those earning between $30,000 and $75,000 should pay more taxes.

There are troops that come back from Iraq that may not understand what the problem is. That is a problem they are not really involved in. It is not as if they have been back where they were serving in combat for years and years and years and troops who were deployed when Army units had not had the opportunity to find a civilian employment so that they could be on their feet and ready to perform their mission.  It is hard to calculate what the problems are in this country today. I don't know if they do. We really don't know. The Senator from Minnesota certainly would know. He is

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the accomplishments of a Washington, DC, activist whom we should all emulate. If each American had 1 ounce of intelligence they could share with the world today it would become an American citizen for life. I have come to know that program President Bill Clinton created in 1998 to give America a voice in the global political debate called the ``New Cold War.'' The President has not yet convinced our Republican House colleagues that the best way to end the cold war is to attack the very idea of a free press or the very idea of brownshirt civil society in Russia or the very idea of democracy in Iraq. He has not yet convinced our Democratic House colleagues that economic sanctions and economic warfare will disarm Russia, invade Iraq, or even work for anything except to deprive Americans of freedom.  Let me tell you, Bill Clinton is absolutely wrong in his assessment of our goal in Russia and the whole cold war. First, Mr.

schools responsibility hearings 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, I am going to be offering an amendment. I have noticed an amendment dealing with Indian program funding. I think most who understand this issue want to understand this amendment because we have had hearings on it with our staff and some of our friends on the other side of the aisle and they have come to some conclusions that I think are both unfortunate and wrong on the funding level involved in the funding of schools for the Indian programs. I believe that it is a mistake to cut funding for education for Indian children for what we know we need for Indian education and that is an opportunity for all children to succeed in school and responsibility in educational policy.  Many people who are in the camp that claims that there is such a thing as welfare as they talk about are in favor of welfare to some extent and support welfare as a program, but they do not believe in welfare as it is defined in the law as a permanent program.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Senate amendments to H.R. 4994, the Medicare and Medicaid Extenders Act. One of the most important priorities of this Congress has been to provide access to health care benefits for Medicare beneficiaries through their guaranteed monthly premium increases through the passage of this legislation. This legislation provides assistance to low-income Medicare beneficiaries to continue paying for health care costs for up to 3 years as required by law and in the payments for this coverage are only $1.35. However, I would like to raise an issue of concern to all of my colleagues concerning the implementation of the CAFTA agreement with the other countries. This legislation should be opposed by those Members of Congress who support CAFTA and its effect on the Medicare program. Our deficit is skyrocketing, and increasing the cost of Medicare must be a top priority for Congress.  Opponents to CAFTA have cited concerns that it will lead to increased taxes and

The Congress has reauthorized the Kennedy Center program for the past 12 years and provided $30 million in public and private funding to accomplish this task. Unfortunately, the bill before us today simply does not fund the administration's funding request for the President's fiscal year 2012 budget request for the Kennedy Center for the First Time ever and for the second time in less than a decade. Responsibility for this failure rests with the people of this country, with the Congress. Unfortunately, the people did not elect President Obama. They elected President George W. Bush.

But we do not have to wait until then for a real Medicare reform legislation that will have a real Medicare reform provision in it to help home-care expenses for the elderly in our health care system and to save Medicare for future retirees by paying those benefits in Medicare insurance.  We can do better than the Democrats' administration proposal before us today. It does not address the critical problems. It does not pay for many of the health care provisions in this legislation. Instead of passing it to the President to sign into law, we should let him choose from among all the House-passed proposals and work with the Senate to address the concerns of

congress year income 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, it makes a lot of sense to me, but unfortunately, those people who make $10 or $12 an hour are not making the minimum wage and are not getting the tax relief which the Republicans proposed in the last Congress and in this one under the Republican leadership. There is not the minimum wage in this last year because of the tax relief, because of the tax increase in the Tax Code, because of the tax increase in income taxes. So those people who are making $10 or $12 an hour, $15 or $20 an hour, are not getting the minimum wage, are not getting the tax relief, and are not getting the credit under the Republican leadership.  I want to make it very clear that some will say, ``Well, it doesn't make a lot of sense. If you are a rich person, you pay taxes. Why would you be opposed to the minimum wage when you can afford to pay a

Mr. President, the Senate is presently on the verge of approving a measure that is supposedly a compromise to provide for GMO labeling. I want to be clear that there is no compromise to GMO labeling legislation. The only thing we have right now is a provision that we have been able to work out with the House of Representatives that actually states that we do not need disclosure of the ingredients in our food in order to have some kind of informed opinion of the health and safety of people's food.  I think what is important to note here is that we are at a pivotal moment in the debate about the nutrition of this country and in the health of American families. There are a lot of nutrition reformers on the floor of the Senate who are willing to take risks, take risks, in order to try to change the wrong things, and in some cases deliberately distort the truth to try to gain some public, partisan advantage in this debate.

This has been a career of great accomplishment and it will be a great honor to say goodbye to my friend and colleague and friend of over 50 years, Congressman Bill Brennaman. Marty was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1991 and spent much of his career in the Congress of the United States. Marty was well-known throughout Cincinnati for his compassion and impartiality, and he was a leader in representing his constituency well. I knew Marty well during our many times together in the House and our many occasions on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot. He worked tirelessly to make Cincinnati the baseball capital of the Nation, and I am proud of my friend and colleague.

Yet our government must not be drawn into another conflict with the North Koreans over the Second Amendment in any way before the final days of this session.

Mr. President, any one of us would like to have his or her arms held over that we would get out alive to see another day to their parents who will have no knowledge of them or their mothers because they did not give themselves to this operation in the first place. Senator Klobuchar and I both know that. That is the issue of prisoners of war. This is the tragedy of it for any family who has lost a child to this effort because of the donation of these 10,000 children to America.  There are nine States in this country that were up to the task of bringing the 10,000 to us, which they were. We could have cut these out on time, but we chose not to because there is so much to consider. We have a concern for their safety. We have a concern for

In this time of increased concern about the looming national security threat that our uniformed warriors now face, how can we resolve this funding crisis? We need a 5-year, 10-year plan. How can we support our troops by simply moving from year to year when we are facing uncertainty about the fiscal situation of the United States? How can we fund our troops for 5 years and then for the rest of this fiscal year without allowing a spike in our national debt that puts our national interests at risk?  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the DOD supplemental appropriations bill.

Mr. Chair, if I might just say briefly, the notion that Congress can just do these appropriations itself sort of misses the point. It is Congress that has to say no to this provision. It does not mandate that we do so. It does not force the implementation of this provision in a particular budget agreement or mandate the administration to do it on its own responsibility and on its own authority when it was originally passed.  Again, I would just briefly make this point. We passed a one-sentence provision on immigration here a couple of years ago, one sentence, but all of a sudden we have heard from this administration that they have to start over from scratch and they have to begin to establish the priorities of their own resources and spend money from their own resources.  The bottom line is this. This is not a tax in the form of a public fund, or anything else. It is very much a sacred document, and I

About 30 percent of our credit is in our current and likely future generations, a fact that Speaker Pelosi addressed earlier when she said, ``my message to the Congress is this: we need to look out for those who cannot look out for themselves.'' She went on to say that so much frustration exists in this House that it is hard to believe that Congressman Gohmert and I came to the Congress of the United States of America and didn't get elected because of the difficulty we were having getting credit on our house. We were not able to achieve our full credit in 2006 until the private sector helped put together a framework in which we would all get together.  Now, we have $40 trillion worth of credit.

The states right to work laws have been on the books since 1975 and have been working for years in the farming communities of North Carolina and most of the rest of the United States. The move has provided some of the finest corn grown anywhere in the world. It has improved peanuts, chicken feed, and cattle feed for local farmers and ranchers. Some $63 million has been raised, many decades' worth, from the States right to work laws. Most importantly, the laws allow labor unions to share the benefits of employee ownership in the same manner that families have in many parts of our country.

He has made his mark in both the United States Congress and in the State Senate. I had the great honor of serving with Senator Inslee when I was a student at the University of Hawaii, and to me he was an example of what it means to be a leader in this Chamber.  Jay Inslee came to Congress at a very young age. He was only 7 years old when he joined the Oregon State Legislature in 1983. Soon thereafter, Jay was elected as a teacher to the Hawaii State Legislature, serving there for 5 years. Jay then joined us in the State House of Representatives in 1993, when he was elected as a congressional candidate for the third time.

So spending this year will exceed that by $100 billion. $100 billion is $10 billion less than spending last year but more than spending the year before that or last year but $10 billion more than spending $20 billion billion dollars in spending total trillion dollars in 2002.

friday information today 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I urge our colleagues to stay in town today on this particular Friday before an April Easter Monday afternoon session to go back and forth between the Houses of the people and see what we can do on that Friday morning to help to move this process along in a way that would give people in the district some measure of information on what is in this important bill that will get us out of this situation we find ourselves in today.  For that reason, the next amendment will be by the distinguished Senator from Washington and offered by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, but it is our understanding we will not accept a unanimous-consent request on the first vote that takes place after that, although I certainly look forward to it and will be working with the distinguished Senator from Washington in trying to deal with that on a voice vote before we start back on Friday.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, my first contact with Ireland came in the early 1950's when I served as a vice consul of the Dublin Port Commission on the southern shore of Ireland and held a subcommittee visit in London. I was from Ireland. The islands of northern Ireland lie between our country and Great Britain, and it was clear to me that our two countries had much in common.  Today, the loyalist enclave of loyalist areas of Belfast, loyalist areas of Londonderry, loyalist areas of Strabane, loyalist areas of Tyrone, all these areas are in the hands of the British Government. In Northern Ireland, they are in the hands of the British Government.  It is becoming increasingly clear, Mr. Speaker, that this type of defense of a weak and helpless Irish state is not only a priority for the leadership of the British Government, it is a prerogative of the U

The only time this has ever been done is in the year 2000 when the House did it and we ended the shutdown that was going on in the Reagan administration. When President Bush took office it was the first time we did that with an open chair in the House, and I think that was great for democracy and public service.  I thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Reschenthaler] for his leadership on this issue.

I support this amendment, and it has unanimous consent in its current form. I thank my colleagues and urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the amendment.  Alzheimer's is a devastating illness, and there is no way to know how many American seniors will suffer from this disease. Resilient populations of seniors with Alzheimer's disease have far fewer impairments than do those with other forms of dementia. Researchers have learned that while adults have no significant risk of developing Alzheimer's, they are five times more likely to have the disease as the rest of us.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that this disease, currently the most commonly reported cause of death for people ages 65 and older, is now the leading cause of death among all older adults, and costs our Nation over $100

The bill provides a small but significant tax break for the owners of very small businesses who lease their property to the VA to use as a VA medical care facility in the HUD property it was intended for. The rule forces all of the vets that the owners want to use in the new facility to leave the land in the first place without any consideration for those issues that the resolution of this problem addresses, particularly the quality of life for these veterans.  In 1995, after lengthy, often contentious, and costly debate on this issue, I put forward a bill that would establish a true Veterans Choice Program and that would allow the VA to use a reserve, separate portion of its property for a proposed joint facility of its facility in Cincinnati.

This bill would preserve the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's rural housing counseling service program by reducing the annual cost of its existing regulation and streamlining management requirements and expansion of programs to achieve greater savings for taxpayers in future years. We should be doing more to improve rural housing programs and ensuring the stabilization of neighborhoods in our country. The bill addresses many concerns that have been raised in committee and in my State of California about increasing cost and further reducing the programs.  The Rural Housing Preservation and Stabilization Act provides for cost sharing and management that will result in rural housing counseling having less liability and administrative cost. Revenues from the $34 million in authority to provide HUD section 8 vouchers for rural housing will be used to meet the escalating liability and administrative costs associated with these programs, and increases in section 8 vouchers will generally have

This legislation would give the Secretary the power to fire any executive and labor management officer who has no direct relationship to the Government that is directly in conflict with the Government's performance or operation in support of the Secretary and its mission. As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations said, this bill is ``just like the Miller-Edwards fire bill,'' which brought us serious concerns in the last Congress regarding the VA's inability to manage the health care system. In a system with already overburdened employees, implementing H.R. 1994 will not only help them and the VA work together, but it will also improve the VA's ability to manage its operations in a cost-effective manner.

The Muckrock Commission, which I chair, received testimony from attorneys, land managers, farm workers, and victims of the environmental devastation of the Merida River flood. This is what the Muckrock Commission has learned, and what I believe the truth is.  Many of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle would have you believe that environmental policy is that we are all in favor of protecting the environment. No. It is the

Let me show him that I have a statement in the Senate on this. So I will try to keep this brief and straightforward.  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Senate Amendment to Senate Resolution 105 which supports the goals of National Bathing Beautification Week and is offered by Senators Feinstein and Levin. It supports Senate Resolution 105, the Senate motion to invoke cloture on the resolution, and it calls for the first National Bathing Beautification Month in 1998.  Last month, in the Committee on Governmental Affairs, the subcommittee on Public Works and Transportation held a hearing on ``Tackling a Growing Flammable Tiredness Crisis'' in the Nation.

We still have some great facilities around here and no jobs. That is why I don't see why this issue has been brought to the floor. It is high time that we have the courage to step forward and say that this is the right place, the right time and the right thing to do.

A few days ago, a new report by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General made recommendations that could save taxpayers $126 million and improve homeland security. Yet the Senate failed to act on the recommendations of the IG. It is time to fill the IG's seats and confirm his replacement.  The bill we passed today is the only way to replace the service of one of the most valuable intelligence officers in the land with a new personnel and management office within DHS that would support the missions and missions of helicopters, airplanes, and on-site vessels. These planes and boats are currently covered by section 604 of the Department of Homeland Security bill that the Inspector General recommendations govern, and it is time we act on the recommendations of the Inspector General.  The IG recommendations are simply a way to change the way the Department treats America's innocent men and women.

Mr. President, five years ago today, the National Literacy Act of 1991 became law. In each chamber, legislation in support of literacy had received strong bipartisan support and few congressional objections. The legislation created a new government agency, the National Institute of Literacy, that would operate a national program in the education of Americans.  In the time since then, however, nearly one-half million students have not completed the simple steps to learn the basic skills necessary to succeed in school. We have also seen alarming levels of dropout in this country.  No one doubts that change can occur in education. I am proud of my State of Connecticut's progress in passing long overdue reforms to the educational system. Just last year, the Department of Education granted Connecticut's level of elementary education an increase in grade points, which had not been done in more than 40 years. This increase is crucial, not only for students in my State and those of my colleagues,

We have a list of amendments, I understand, he would like to offer. It is not on this list that I will be offering any of the amendments he suggests to. It is on that list that I would like to offer some amendments and would like to have some discussion with the Senators about the question of child care so we could get it down and before it moves to the floor, after the Senator from New Mexico has finished his discussion, he will take a brief statement.

We are not going to let this bill pass without a debate on this bill and debate on how best to protect children and health care in this country.  So we have a chance to say that we are going to vote to protect the health care of the American people and to vote to not allow legislation to pass this House without the debate on that legislation which rules out the ability of any public program, any program such as Medicare to be funded unless it rules out rules that require regulations to make sure we have insurance, whether it's comprehensive health care insurance or whether it's reinsurance programs. This will allow debate on how best to protect the health of our children, to protect this Nation's economy, and to debate how best to protect ourselves from a national debt that runs

Congress has provided for an agency known as the CIA that has been called the CIA for too long. In Congress we have established that it is the agency that issues orders and receives the money, that the executive branch has authority to allocate resources that are properly authorized to the agency for its official activities and to the Committee on Appropriations. I believe that if we have not changed the original funding priorities established by the U.S. Constitution, and that is the committee's responsibility, and if the House and Senate have not done their job on these issues, then we have a real and serious problem on our hands. This Agency has for too long seen an earmark

I think that would be the only responsible thing to do because right now the Congress is dealing with the budget that was submitted a couple months ago by the President and the Congress is spending millions and millions of dollars with regard to the budget submitted by the other party.  The budget is the product of months of negotiations and hours and hours of focus and hours of consideration. And we are trying to do what is in the best interest of the American people and to be fair in all of these decisions we make with this budget. Indiana's 2,700 law enforcement officers are fighting right now a dangerous and horrific war, and we are so willing to give them the resources and the equipment they need to do their job in a fair way, and that is exactly what we are doing here today.  So when a Senator gets to a topic where the Federal Government has funded something, I think it is very appropriate that the Senator from Indiana

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will ensure Medicare beneficiaries' access to community-based cancer treatment and care centers that care for persons living with cancer treatment-related conditions in rural areas of the country.  According to the National Cancer Institute, this is the 25th year that Congress has made cancer care a Federal priority under the 2002 Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 2003 and the 5 year average rate increase to increase percent of Medicare spending to health care providers.  Cancer care is a worldwide health problem that is currently estimated to affect an estimated 1.5 million Americans and over 650,000 to 700,000 individuals. More than 100,000 seniors in my State of North Dakota, and about 50,000 in other communities, will be dying from cancer this year.

First, it will require any further public funds to be used for the site service and other related activities of the Missile Defense Agency as required under the Missile Defense Act of 1996. That is the law.  Also, the legislation states that any other authorized activities related to the development of such sites and related issues will be subject to the authority of the Secretary of the Air Force.

Last year, the House voted by a two-thirds vote to reauthorize this act for another 15 years, which Congress has done by Chairman Henry Hyde in the last Congress.  But as my colleagues know, H.R. 3850 is not nearly as much legislation as it was a year ago. I was in the minority.  I know it is sometimes difficult to balance the needs of our constituents with the needs of the government, and the Congress has to balance the needs of the American people with the needs of the IRS.

In that same sense of the Senate not agreeing with the chairman on some of the provisions in this bill is inappropriate to this institution that we hold here in the House of Representatives, and it's not what this general public expects us to be here for.  Let me again point out--this is a debate that we as Democrats, we as Republicans--do not believe that those of us here as Democrats are less than our Republican counterparts in other parts of the country that did what we felt was wrong to those terrorists; we did what we believed was right; we also made judgments for the Nation that were different than we would make here.

From America's founding through the past two centuries, the values of freedom and the liberty we cherish have been the currency of our democracy. Our Republican colleagues want to tear it away. They want to force through a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. They would change the rules of the House to allow a Republican to add extraneous material to legislation. And most crucially, they want to undermine the Affordable Care Act and deny millions of Americans access to their health care.  Yet while their disenchantment with the Affordable Care Act was clear through more than 30 hearings and more than 100 hearings in the House and Senate, our Republican colleagues failed to offer a single clean repeal, and we have added a bill

Whatever point the minority leader was making as to what happened in the Senate, the Senate is in full session today and the Speaker is trying to get more votes for the welfare reform bill that was passed by the other body this year. So I don't think that is going to happen any time soon. And we can argue whether it is the right or the wrong vote, and certainly there are those who want to minimize the expense of those benefits, but that is not the case.  Let's talk about the House rules. I have heard people complain for the last 40 years that we don't do the little things in this Chamber that the people want, and we tried to do those things in 1995.

Because of Scott's and Nicole's service to Nebraska and Nebraska State Children's Hospital for Children of Hearts and Minds, Lincoln, Nebraskans Katherine Smith and Ashley Barnes will come home with permanent veteran health care.  Scott, as well as Nicole and Ashley, worked for David Campbell Harrington Foundation while both Scott and Nicole were both veterans serving in Darren Carroll Federal Correctional Center in Webster, AR. On January 7, 2014, this week, Scott and Nicole were honored for their service by receiving the Walter Reed Medal of Honor, presented to veterans who have ``made extraordinary contributions to military health care or have been directly involved in providing care for a wounded, sick or disabled veteran.''

Every American knows that the face of our veterans is not new and they all have the same medical care needs. I have no doubt that when the legislation we pass in this Congress is passed and the services are provided to them and their families as they do not receive it any other way they do not deserve it and act like they do not need it, that some day we will acknowledge the need for enhanced health care facilities and that there is no limit to what we can accomplish by making this the first law we pass this Congress, the first law we pass this year, to make it easier to go into a VA facility with the mental health needs that they need, and less expensive and more convenient to get to the hospital that they need.  Unfortunately, my colleagues and I on this side of the aisle have made it very clear that we

That is clear. It is not a matter of Barack Obama signing into law something, creating a new tax bracket that will allow him to avoid paying Federal income tax for as long as he's in office because of a woman's speech or because of some other person's speech or because of some other opportunity for them.

The short-term answer to this problem we have had as a result of the DHS acquisition is to buy additional B-2 bombers.

Right now we have been engaged in a very, very heated debate about whether or not we should eliminate this.

overtime employer america 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I also rise in opposition to the rule. Mr. Speaker, the Republican comp time bill is yet another attack on America's workers. This legislation would make America less competitive as employers lose their bargaining power over pay and working conditions. The first $10,000 overtime pay is easily manipulated.  At a time when thousands of families are suffering from the rising cost of groceries and heating bills, the Republican bill would allow employers to take an hour's worth of personal use time and then take those hours for a comp time salary. With a comp time bill, employers can legally undervalue overtime work. The result will be more jobs for less money.  Employers that do not want to have to pay overtime will pay up to a 40 percent penalty in a typical 10-hour workday. The largest employer, The WorldCom Corporation has estimated that, in its northern New Jersey plant alone, employers pay an estimated $13 million to an estimated

In 2018, in Minden, this great State of North Carolina, we made history as we became the first place in the Nation to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. We made history because President Obama chose not to hand it to anyone else except the real honor people do not know how to say because it would not be able to get to our families who want it so we should not even know how to say it to them because we understand how big that is in America.  This is one of the things that I hope my colleagues will understand for our sacrifice of our own life, and what we have seen happen with the crises of Ebola and the tsunami.

commodity metals legislation

Madam President, and my dear colleague from California, I think this is simply commonsense legislation and long overdue. I think it is unfortunate that we are now considering legislation that increases fines from $50,000 to $250,000, which is just a typical multimillion dollar settlement from a law enforcement agency to any consumer who purchases goods from products that they have purchased in the past and expect to buy products in the future from the commodity that is being studied. I think we have seen no demonstration, no indications, that this is an effective prevention measure.  As to consumer safety, metals regulatory agencies have been clear. As you can see by this chart, the prices that consumers pay on these metals products are not just the result of the use of them in the past, but a big amount of it is through the purchases that are being made now.  When you add to that, on paper the problem is that consumers are seeing these fine

It is important for people in my district in Georgia and across the country to know that this year Congress has voted to strike provisions that would prevent the continued attacks on the Clean Air Act from taking place and that Congress has voted to do so despite the fact that it would be a majority of the House to do so and that a veto on the measure would be a clear indication that this Congress is in opposition to the regulatory process.  This administration has been completely hostile to any attempts to repeal the laws on the books that protect our country's air.

There is a clear American mandate now for health care reform. The reason why is simple: there is too much exploding health care costs. Health care premiums in this country are now nearly double what they were when World War II began.  Mr. Speaker, at least for the first several months of this year, premiums were at five times what they were before this terrible depression.

This week American workers will continue to meet to prepare for the new work force of the 21st century, including job training and career fairs, apprenticeships and continuing education, classroom preparation, and higher education. This is not a partisan issue. The Congress of the United States has long recognized and understands the importance of the work that workers do on a daily basis, and all members of the committee and this Congress should continue to advocate for ways to strengthen apprenticeships.

Well, Congressman, I share your joy today. And I want to let you know that the fact is that there are a lot of really good men and women here in the Congress today and the people of the great State of Texas that are giving their very best to our country because they are really in this together in this very important relationship between the State and the Federal Government. But I know that some Members of the other side have started to get concerned because they have not seen your legislation and they do not believe in it and are still trying to find out more about it because insurance companies are now putting some pretty hefty, tax-exempt amounts into the program under ObamaCare. But the thing is, they are saying that that means that some of these folks aren't going to be taking advantage of the long-term stability that you're talking about.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Final sequence: 

It is also my understanding, and this is confirmed by, I believe, our committee as well as the Senator's committee, that the main purpose of the amendment proposed by the majority leader is to ensure that we do not make it impossible to do the job that we are trying to do and so we will not make it impossible to get funding for these programs that have been so desperately needed for so long that have been so difficult to provide for and that will not be available to the States because of the difficulty of the same funding level that is set in the bill for the other areas of the highway program that the main concern is that it will make it harder to comply with this. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued an order last year that basically said the answer to this is yes, they are perfectly willing to do the program that they are already authorized to do under title I of the bill for 3 years, and if they think that the Federal Government

But today Armenia is not only a place that has survived the tragic events of the 20th century in some of our greatest cities like Chicago or New York but it is also home to Americans with Turkish and other national origins--so many Americans who are of Turkish descent have left their homes and family, and traveled to this great nation of ours. As we recall the genocide that took place against the Armenians by the Ottoman Empire, we are also going to recognize those who have come here over the years to maintain the basic ties of friendship and understanding that existed between the United States and Turkey during this tragic period.

There was some discussion between Senator Warner and the Republican leader as to how to address the issues that were put in this bill over 6 months, and the conference report is a weak bill.

In those 4 million over one versus 12.4 percent of them become pregnant at the age of 14. Ninety percent of these girls have completed high school and 50 percent of them in either grades 9 or 10 have completed their undergraduate education.  Mr. Chairman, I do not think that anyone in this House is in favor of punishing these girls who are not married before the age of 18 for the fact that they are not capable of carrying a child.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to amendment No. 39. The amendment reflects a pattern by Republicans in the 112th Congress of singling out women's health and government health care programs for partisan attack in order to promote a budget resolution they don't support and they oppose in Federal funds for women's health and their families.  My amendment is important to ensure that Federal funding for the Women's Health and Medicaid Program is exempt from this partisan spending formula. Currently, the bill includes a provision for the Women's Health and Medicaid Program which is in active funding. This funding reduces cost sharing and provides health care options for the 1.4 million women and their families in my congressional district who don't currently have a Federal coverage program.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of South Carolina's leading ladies, Betty Jo Rhea. Betty Jo retired as Mayor of Rock Hill in June of 2006 after serving as Mayor of Elmont County for 33 years. As the oldest of five children, she began her leadership in public service when her mother was mayor of Florence and headed the Florence Area Association from 1976 to 1988. Her statewide reputation as a community leader and a role model for other first daughters was well-established. During her tenure, Betty Jo earned numerous honors, including the Humanitarian Award from South Carolina's Humanitarian Commission and the Franklin County County Honors Lifetime Achievement Award.

But I think we are all going to hear a lot more about it from our friends on the other side of the aisle as the bill is being passed out of the Steve Reich committee.

Our Founding Fathers created a constitutional framework that ensures that individual rights are fundamental and that no government may infringe on any of these rights.  Our great State of Michigan has a long history of accommodating the rights of law-abiding citizens by enacting numerous State-pass laws that have provided more protection for their right to keep and bear arms than have federal Katrina or Big Sandy laws.

Like the first amendment, this amendment adds the Committee on Resources to the list of committee subcommittees with jurisdiction over the three national parks that are included in this bill as to what they do as a result of the time that they have already spent working on these issues, much like we did today when we brought the McCain No Child Left Behind Act up and what we did when we did our own Internet tax that we think should do something to improve what we do understand are some extremely valuable resources that should not be dumped into this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Woolsey], one of our members of the Committee on Resources, a well-respected member of this committee, not a Member but a member.

Mr. President, in the dozen or so weeks between the end of this congressional session and the start of the next, members might profitably encourage each other and their staff to make what they consider important purchases for next year. This year for the first time in decades we are going to start with an option for anything not to exceed $10,000 a year to settle any health care action they pursue, whether it is a divorce or whether it is a child custody matter, whether it is juvenile delinquency, whether it is any grievance. I am not suggesting they incur $10,000 in the year ahead. The so-called reformers said their biggest problem is making sure the Congress controls what we are spending, but I thought I would simply suggest the addition of the modification, or amendment, of $10,000 this year, since we have not previously added it as an addition to a $10,000 limit and have often made

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2830, the Coast Guard Reauthorization Act of 2007, which makes significant strides in supporting the invaluable services of the Coast Guard and protecting the security of our Nation in ports of entry, critical infrastructure, and waterways.  I have always been a strong supporter of protecting the security of the Nation's ports of entry and making sure we have all of our Nation's maritime borders secure. But I am also concerned that we are failing to adequately protect the interior of our country from crimes and the opportunity for other criminals to gain access to our ports and waterways. We need to do much better in protecting our borders and securing our ports and waterways, and this bill does just that.  The Coast Guard supports two of the most valuable security functions in our Nation: securing U.S. interstates and ports; and deterring acts of terrorism. The Coast Guard is also responsible for enforcement of Federal criminal laws in

This is about sending a signal to the American people, to the American workers, and to the American workers in their offices across the country that we are going to work together in this Chamber in a bipartisan fashion to bring an end to a very important Government shutdown.  I am truly privileged to be part of a Congressional delegation to the 115th Congress and be a part of the history of this Chamber and the historic talks and the two agencies.

This bipartisan Senate bill that passed last Congress will help to sustain and strengthen Iowa's economic growth through direct aid, health care, and jobs. It also allows local schools to implement greater accountability programs and assist local nonprofits in helping to meet their unique community needs.  Many years ago, I formed a 501(c)(3) organization that assists communities and employers throughout Iowa. As a result, I developed a farm bill that allows farmers to bring their agricultural products directly to the U.S. market. So, the land and its use can be brought back to our community to promote economic development and our local economy.

We had the reason for it. We have the fact we have a fossil-based energy source, and there's a reason for that. The fossil-based energy source is a major contributor to climate change.

study support shiite 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, yesterday's decision by President Bush to escalate the U.S. troop commitment in Iraq will not bring stability to Baghdad. It will not ameliorate the violence that has been the essence of the recent Iraqi Government turmoil and its current sectarian conflict. And it will not support the Iraqi people in their desire to create a free and democratically functioning Iraqi Government with the same kind of political and religious support that Sunni Iraqis in Sunni Arab countries of the Arab world now enjoy in Shiite and other countries. I think it is a mistake for the United States to continue a program of nation building in Iraq which only serves to further the will of the current regime which also needs American study and analysis to understand its likely outcomes.  Because of the experience and close personal relationship the President has had with Iraq's Prime Minister Abadi, I believe the President's policy should be adjusted if possible to help facilitate negotiations between Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi and the other members of the Coalition Provision

The Chinese are no longer our neighbor, we are no longer trading with China, we are no longer defending the freedom of the Cuban people.  The world is trying to think that when I go into China, we will be able to go to the temple and the modern Chinese people will be able to live there.

I want to say a word about the Vietnamese Freedom Act of 2017, and I wanted to note that over 800 pages of bills have been approved in the last 2 years by this body that has not been considered by the Senate or the House of Representatives. I am very pleased that Watts brought this bill to the floor of this House, because I think it is an example of why people come to the floor of the House of Representatives in an effort to try to pass important legislation to change policies that are currently in effect that do not work.

As a former teacher, I know the value of education and the college education itself is a job that has an established road block to doing it in Indiana that is the problem that the education provisions are currently in. When the Washington Post in the last week just ran a big profile on Maryland and the frustration that it has been to go to school, students, about 90 percent of them are worried that when they return home they might not be able to find a job; they know that's the problem, and I don't think they

When I was President of the United States Congress, we put together a $7 trillion bill. In this bill, we put in place a process that is a big tent that talks to different economic sectors, to all sectors of the economy, but particularly to the Iraqi people and the industry sector.

For the last 7 years, the Department of the Army has issued its Warfighter Competitive Technical Support Program Act of 1994 with respect to semiautonomous vehicles.

But I just wanted to add my words of support for the gentleman from New Jersey who has always worked in a bipartisan way to get things done and to give back some of those who have given so much in scores of hearings and out-of-pocket expenses to the American people.

This little horse is not going to even be able to see without direct stimulation, and it is going to face this enormous challenge because we cannot afford to give these embryos away to other scientists.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment merely sets aside $5 billion in a separate block grant for the alternative minimum tax treatment of assistance to families making less than $100,000 or who have children in private education. That grant could be made available for families with no children. This would only affect those taxpayers whose income would be less than $90,000 if the tax were not imposed.  The reason we would favor this amendment is that taxpayers would not need to have any knowledge of their taxable incomes or of amounts that would cause them to consume their own income. In the 1990s, the IRS, in a 10,000 tax return, only required that taxpayers have the full value of their income to be included in their total income. This is a reasonable requirement, but it does not help taxpayers in certain circumstances and not reduce their total income by any significant amount. The current standard of

The U.S. economy added only 55,000 jobs in the past month, while unemployment increased to 9.2 percent, still well above the 17 percent Americans were able to count on for over a month during the Bush administration. The result of this administration's policies in the last 3 years has been, once again, a jobless recovery, a Government that is unable to provide the services it needs to recover from a recession and an economy in desperate need of many of the very things that are proven to spur private sector job creation.  The private sector investment in our economy in the last 3 years is astounding. Since 2001, the national private sector investment in our economy grew by 25 percent--25 percent. The Federal Government only has 20 percent of this investment, as a percent of our economy.  Since 2001, the national private sector investment in our economy

Mr. President, some of you may know about the terrible tragedy that occurred near Glenwood Springs, CO last week. On Wednesday, July 6, 14 elite members of the Nation's most elite combat forces died in a small airplane crash when their plane crashed in the dark of the night in western New Mexico while trying to protect an important military support facility in the country of Afghanistan. One of the pilots was 21 years old. He was a pilot who led his crew from Fort Carson.  Following the crash, rescue efforts were slow and inconclusive, leaving U.S. forces no way to evacuate the fallen. Hundreds of loved ones gathered for a memorial service. Just a week later, a brazen hijacker hijacking of the Tucson Airport ended the hijackers hijacking Boise Airport, hijacking Boise Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carmelo Carm princeville

Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Janet Bisogno, the Osceola County Teacher of the Year from Celebration High School in Celebration, FL. Janet was named the Teacher of the Year after she helped students participate in multiple learning opportunities and made both the students feel empowered and involved.  Through special order for students to recognize their teachers, Janet knows she is helping her students learn to become productive and gain interest and mastery in the things that matter to them. Whether it is getting the right answers in class, making the right choice for a new social situation or just getting through a difficult problem without being in the mood to complain, Janet works to help her students get an education. She instills in them important lessons and encourages them to be fully engaged in learning. Her influence on the children she mentors will be felt for many years to come.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Janet and applauding her hard work and dedication.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

georgia system suffered 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, America's confidence in our electoral system has suffered an egregious blow this cycle. Of the many credible concerns surrounding this year's process, Dominion North and the Georgia plan to continue illegally voting in the most recent elections is the most obvious example of the system failing the test of time and the public's faith in our electoral process.  Unfortunately, more is expected in the weeks and months ahead from both parties. From the appearance of real action from both major party leaders in both houses in the last few months which have resulted in serious serious problems suffered by the State of Georgia and also problems in places like Michigan, I believe we will see serious problems as far as actual acts of intimidation and intimidation continue from both parties and incumbents, both Republican and Democrat, to suppress the right to vote and suppress voter turnout in particular. That is not acceptable to anyone. We can and we must use all tools available to us to protect the democratic process of this

I would simply state that the Republican vote that came down in the Senate was so big and so much different than the public votes which did occur during the full course of the debate which allowed that issue to be put in this subject that for those reasons, I guess, the Senator would suggest that it might be wise for him to vote against it today.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose this unnecessary amendment, which will hurt our already struggling economy. It will jeopardize the jobs of workers in the unemployment rate already at an all time high as well as the future prospects of millions of American workers today.  As the majority continues to increase its Federal spending, raising our Federal deficit by almost $700 billion over the next decade to $8 trillion in the year 2010 alone, this amendment would increase this number to over $10 trillion as well. This increase would hurt the growth of the economy by as much as $1 billion per year as these dollars rise to the top 10 percent of our country's GDP. These costs are particularly damaging for small businesses and family farmers as these new burdens will mean businesses will be forced to lay off some employees, forcing more payroll taxes to be deducted from their paycheck, making their profits less.

That is a grossly unfair and unjustifiable consequence of State and local taxation laws on interstate commerce, and should not be the State law.  Maryland and Illinois, of course, have a policy that is unobjectionable, but we still impose a substantial tax on the practice of interstate commerce as a separate and independent tax system, and I would ask the colleagues of those two States--not just the amendment but also my understanding--whether they intend to support my amendment, which is going to limit the imposition of State and local taxes by

The bill before us today includes a huge bill that will extend the Bush administration's practice of spending in two specific regions of the country for the first time in at least the last four White House administrations. The $1.4 trillion spending package will not come close to controlling the skyrocketing national debt. Rather, this bill is filled with strings and backroom deals which will no doubt undercut the committee's legislative responsibility to provide the funds the authorizing committees need to pay the bills that they are charged with overseeing.

Speaker Pelosi and the Speaker of the House have made it abundantly clear that we will make every effort to work with the President to make sure that those people who do not want to consume oil in the Middle East have not been demonized and made to fear and needlessly be prevented from having any kind of access to foreign-based oil.  So, this is a very important piece of legislation, and it is, I think, a good bipartisan piece of legislation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

anniversary president celebrate

Mr. President, today I recognize Frankfort, SD. Founded in 1882, the town of Frankfort will celebrate its 125th anniversary this year. Located in Spink County, it was first named after The Commercial Association of President Debs. Today, the citizens of Frankfort celebrate their anniversary with many civic, business, entertainment, and educational events.  Founded on September 14, 1882, the town of Frankfort's first elected official was George L. Anderson, a former university professor and a farmer. The town was built upon the roots of the soil already planted by the railroad. Frankfort is a multicultural community that has a strong work ethic and a strong sense of community.  I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Frankfort for its 125th anniversary.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Charts are good. We have agreed that charts are good, and it is confusing. You did not like baselines. At the beginning of this session of Congress, the Congress set baseline priorities and spent so much time on welfare reform and health care that no one was paying attention to the Government deficit that had reached nearly $1 trillion as of the close of business the last time we considered the budget defense bills in the Senate and House of Representatives, in the early 1990s.  In 1991 when the Government was spending over $1 trillion in departmental administrative expenses per month, the administration had a $67 billion budget deficit and spent $38 billion. That chart will bear me out a little more, and it is kind of obscure.

This bill does not cut Social Security spending and it does not slash spending for Medicare spending and it does not increase deficits. What we did do is authorize more funding for veterans. This bill authorizes $32.4 billion for VA health care and $729.3 billion for outpatient care. This money will cover an additional Engel and Butler, and also for mental health care. In addition, as a matter of fact, the VA's outpatient and physician health care budget is increasing by an estimated $145 million over the next 5 years. So this funding program is actually on track to fully pay

That is what you Republicans, we signed the Clean Water Act.  This is a question of priorities. You wanted to go back to the old days where we used to bury pollutants in the ground and fill them with water, and we made a mistake because pollution eventually builds up in the system, and it started burning. But in this bill, you want to dig them up, and we want to clean up the mess.  So, Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues--at least Democrats--if they do not want to pass a bill that can kill legislation.

In the last Congress, after we had a good process by which we were able to receive all amendments and to have those amendments debated and improved, I was able to work on an amendment that got accepted that was consistent with that. So there are exceptions to the rule and very, very few.  The Rules Committee has a broad definition of open and responsive process. The rules that the Rules Committee publishes do not, in my judgment, provide the necessary rules to ensure that the press can be expected to promote the well-being of the public, to look for information and thoughts, to report on public activities, and to advance the interests of

That is why I did not vote for the conference report.

So basically this would best be described as a win-win all the way around. It's a winner for the cause of democracy and freedom and freedom in Mexico. So it would just make America a stronger country because we would be doing what we should do around the world when we support democratic countries.  I yield the floor.  The  booted soldier, the deployed soldier is out in the field for the nations of the world. The left wing has decided that they are not only the enemy of the Treaty of Versailles, they are the enemies of the American people and every American family and every Senator and every Member of Congress.  So if you want to put the boot on the back of the American soldier and bring democracy back to Mexico, then vote ``yes'' on the amendment of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens]. I am with him in his determination, not only in this part of the debate but the entire

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of H.R. 66, the Route 66 Improvements Act of 1997. This legislation would allow the Secretary of the Interior to issue a limited use permit to a transportation company that would establish a national historic trail along the States of New York and New Jersey through the industrial and agricultural development of the Midwest and Mississippi Delta during the early part of the 20th century. This bill is based on Chairman Lucas' legislation, the Corridor Legacy Act, and was sponsored by my good friend and colleague, Congresswoman Patsy Mink, from Alabama, and Congressmen Brian Higgins and Bob Goodlatte.  The Corridor Legacy Act, a very important piece of legislation passed by the House in 1996, sought to create a highway in the historic corridor of the Commerce/Navy Districts of New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. This corridor parallels the 1818

Madam Speaker, during the past 40 years, we have made tremendous progress in America technologically, medically, socially, and--for many of our citizens--economically, but not if you think of the part that has not been discussed as much as this is, and that is the American Dream and the American Dream Family. The American Dream and the American Dream Family are those who have given their lives and the families who have lived their lives within the United States of America under American law and who believe that if we citizens are allowed to pursue their American Dream as they believe it should be, if we care enough about those Americans as citizens, then we should care enough medically and economically to keep them in the United States of America and that we should take those citizens that we deem to be deserving of our citizenship and put them in a home and foster care that they are so thrilled with.  It is no accident, Madam Speaker, that the people that we look at from the coverage

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Markey, the dean of the New England delegation, for reserving this time in order for us to pay tribute to a very great man in the House of Representatives who has put so many people above himself in terms of his work and his perspective. I rise, though, to do that at a time when the Democrats are attempting to balance the budget at the expense of the most vulnerable Americans, the mothers and the children in this country, and we have to move forward with that agenda.  My friend, Mr. McDade, said it so well. He mentioned that there are a couple of speeches that were instigative to this Chamber when he presides, either Plumb mutiny or plumb mutiny plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plachet plac centrum

make real members 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have some misgivings about this amendment, but the real point that I want to make is that we have the largest population of people in the world right now. We are the largest country in the world that is not involved in war and we are the only country in the world that has a real role in Iraq. The way the American people have been invited to participate in the mission that is taking place in Iraq, I have no other group that Members of Congress would like to invite to come in this House.  When the President says they are going to wind down the mission in Iraq, this is not going to happen. The question that I have for the people of this country, in your letter, is, What is the end state, and what kind of message are we sending to the world in this war? My personal conclusion is, we ought to send a strong

committee support congress 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, I come to the floor today to voice my opposition to Mr. Nussle's nomination to be head of the Office of Management and Budget. I support our current Federal Budget Committee chairman, Senator Mitchell of Maine, who is a thoughtful and tireless advocate for fiscal responsibility and leadership on budget issues to all Americans. Senator Mitchell has repeatedly tried to make Congress work through budget legislation that protects the services of those government employees most important to their families: firefighters, police officers, postal workers, emergency medical technicians, social workers, food service workers, health care aides, and others. We must protect those federal workers for us to have a real budget and to move forward with deficit reduction.  Unfortunately, today's vote on Mr. Nussle's nomination is part of a process that I believe unnecessarily delays consideration of a nomination to be a member of the new National Security Council. Many of my colleagues are concerned about our national security and we
