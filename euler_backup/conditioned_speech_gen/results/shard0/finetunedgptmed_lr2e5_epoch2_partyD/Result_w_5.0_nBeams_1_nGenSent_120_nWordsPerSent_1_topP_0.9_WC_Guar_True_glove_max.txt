<|endoftext|>Women serve in our legislative and executive branch agencies, and they are the most visible and vital members of our work force. But these important positions remain disproportionately male, with nearly 80 percent of female members holding top government positions in the Bush and Obama administrations and just 20 percent in the Clinton administration and just 5 percent today closing gender gaps.  This must change, and it will require that we eliminate the women-only work space in Government. So I encourage my colleagues to join me in passing the so-called ``Dear Colleague'' letter that was signed by all 37 women members of the White House Task

I want to take a few moments now to highlight the critical importance of those Medicare benefits to my home State of Massachusetts. In 1842

Today we look to share in the benefits of a $

Mr. President, last week I was able to see the new Senate Democrats give us what I believe we can all agree on today when we voted for legislation that the legislation they support and which the President called for has not been done in the Senate for over a year but that the question is going to be put on the House of Representatives. It will be up to that House of Representatives to take up this cost-of-living extension. As my colleagues know, last year we had this extension passed in the House, and that House has a measure before them that has not been on the floor yet, which,

Dr. Coe's judicial career spans 19 years and is considered by many to be the greatest legal scholar in our State.  Throughout his distinguished career

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to honor the history and accomplishments of the New England Sugar Growers Association and the New England Wheat and Canning Association when the two organizations come to the Senate for the first time since 1984.  The New England Sugar Growers Association and the New England Wheat and Canning Association have led the way in meeting the chairman's vision and goal of encouraging and supporting local industries and encouraging new technology in the fields of personal care products and Feinstein Steel.  The founding of the two associations in 1984 was prompted by the need to support the goal of local Iowa sugar growers.

senate budget president 

Final sequence: 

<|endoftext|>President Bush and congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly to approve a budget plan that projected a deficit for 2006 that would have almost doubled under Senator Kerry's budget. Yet, after the budget passed and became law, the White House continued to claim that this deficit would be addressed by the full faith and credit of the United States.  A look at the budget documents reveals that the administration's budget projections are highly misleading. In fact, the administration's annual budget claims to balance the Federal budget in 12 years by 2002. But today, the White House is proposing a budget that, in fact, ignores the actual deficit and

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the fiscal year 2006 Department of Defense authorization bill because of the very serious problem of ongoing military budget cuts that would likely prevent the Federal Government from paying care for our veterans who need care for decades to come. Medicaid is a non-profit health insurance program designed to extend benefits to the uninsured.  All of us are familiar with the stories of our veterans who have been deemed ``high priority'' for special VA care but have been denied access to care because of the arbitrary caps on their benefits under the Medicaid program. The Federal Government provides care for all veterans regardless of income

epa amendment mitigation 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, first, I want to express my appreciation to Senator Domenici for his leadership in terms of mitigation assistance in Montana. Senator Domenici knows this amendment is not germane to any appropriations bill, but it would certainly be useful to EPA. He is an excellent partner in this process and I am pleased that we have taken an affirmative step in this regard.  I have read the amendment and would have voted ``nay'' if it were inserted in the bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the ultimate power to enact legislation is not legislative appropriation or legislation drafted by the Congress. Rather, it is Congress itself that is the actual author or the ultimate agency in authorizing any legislation in the first place. Thus, when legislation is deliberately amended, or the wording of such legislation is changed or, perhaps most importantly, made by an executive, that agency is merely exercising its legislative authority. That is, the legislation passed by the Congress is, in effect, its own agency, and no other agency is vested with legislative responsibility.  The duty of legislative and executive agencies is thus to ensure that legislation

This measure is essential for the administration and the Department of Energy because it would provide for the Columbia disaster relief and agree to the Columbia reports on weapons of mass destruction at Fort Detrick, MD.

While the economic benefits of higher yielding debt are indisputable, those savings alone cannot compensate for the significant cost of educating children. This year's theme, however, calls on policymakers to seriously consider additional alternatives to remedial schooling. The evidence is clear: American students are not paying their college loan bills on time. One in three students is not attending college.  During the last few years, there

West Point is a nationally known institution--its 381 graduates from more than 140 programs in 57 countries, including 15 undergraduate programs and eight graduate programs. It is the only military academy in the world to be awarded the Top

The estate tax does nothing to provide tax relief for middle-class Americans, making the Senate bill more expensive and a poorer package for people in the middle class and lower income families.

The Alabama Supreme Court has not allowed any hearings, not been given any notice at all. Yet we are going to pass this bill and see it signed by President Bush, whose judgment is totally warped by this case.

Some might want to make a different judgment on whether the military action the President is calling for will increase violence in Iraq or increase violence in Iraq only because of some substantial combat activity being conducted in Afghanistan or Somalia or in other parts of the world.  But this is what's going on, which is when the war on Iraq began in 2003. And when I think of our country's long history of supplying weapons of mass destruction to governments of hostile states, whether that be Saddam Hussein of Iraq or Hussein of Iran or whoever it

So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to be offering an amendment that will provide backpay for the Department of Defense for their past performance on accounting and budgeting rules that they used.

But to this day the real history of the victory in World War II continues to be the conflict over the postwar Marshall plan and the battle over the military feasibility of the Marshall plan.  Over pandemic years of the 1950s, there was great interest in the Marshall plan, as a means of Sanders Ridge in Cambodia and for the supply of food. Many government agencies were frustrated that their programs had not been implemented promptly, and in 1958 the President of the United

The Securities and Exchange Commission recently allowed American insurance companies to continue to charge consumers more for their policies, but now they're questioning whether Congress has done enough to clamp down on this pricing injustice.

Madam President, I will take a second to answer that comment from the Senator from South Carolina on the impact of the resolution on the payments that the military will make to military services and the contributions that they will make to the Armed Forces for the conduct of military operations around the world, as well as military base construction and the activities that they are involved in on the ground around the world and attack on air base sites.

At the time Congress passed the Senate bill last year, Republican leaders repeatedly denied that it was a tax increase on middle-class families. Unfortunately, their words have long since changed.  At the time, Speaker Gingrich said: The reason for this legislation is that it does not add to the deficit, and the President has already indicated that the Congress will not require the U.S. Treasury to borrow to pay for it.

I am proud to call Fort Smith one of the finest communities in the State of Arkansas and thank Congressman Rahall for taking the time tonight to talk about Madame Ironside and her amazing life. I urge my colleagues to support the Byrd amendment and to allow me to continue to speak for this community.  <|endoftext|>

Without these provisions, these students would likely not be able to obtain the most affordable and accessible loans in the market.  Because it's in the student loan repayment program that these loans are guaranteed by the Federal Government, it is also in the best interest of students to secure these loans and refinancing.

There was a budget surplus which my Republican colleagues promised to balance, to increase revenues by $10 billion in 1992. In the budget reconciliation, the House Republicans did not come up with an additional $10 billion in revenue. Instead, they increased the budget deficit in 1992 by over $3 billion.

Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the postal reform bill before the Senate today which will provide postal service certainty to more than 2 million Americans in the North and South Central States and New York and New Jersey. This legislation provides for the passing of an interstate mail compact to which Congress and the States will ratify. It eliminates and reinstates some of the important and oft-criticized obstacles in the delivery of postal services which have kept them out of the hands of consumers.  Specifically, the postal compact and other major postal reforms the Senate will consider today provide for the unionization of current mail carriers so

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to call my colleagues' attention to a one of the most important initiatives in this session of Congress and I believe it is one of the least well-publicized of all people involved in this effort, but that is something which should not be missed if we are going to achieve progress for the citizens of Iraq.  On December 6, in the wake of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's decision to seek an independent electoral commission, the United Nations Security Council on December 8 unanimously adopted an Arab League resolution calling on Iraq to change its methods of selecting

Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this very important legislation to strengthen our nation's efforts to meet the cost of protecting the United States from chemical and biological weapons attacks by the Soviet Union and other states that may be now entering into the open war in the former former East Germany and in other formerly communist nations in the former school.  The importance of this legislation cannot be overstated. The conference report before us today is the culmination of four decades of deliberate and comprehensive work by the National Security Council and the chemical warfare effort as a whole.

But if we cut back on health care to a level of 6 percent of the gross domestic product, which would kill all but three agencies of the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development--all three are health departments--we would have lost over $8 trillion in health care.

It is the sense of the Senate that the Federal Reserve Board should demonstrate ``soundness,'' that is, a reliance on sound economic and fiscal policies rather than the whims of a few

But the record speaks loudly and clearly that the Senate is only 10 days from a Supreme Court nominee who has come to the floor only to be blocked. That Mississippi nominee, who has had enough of this subterfuge, the blockade, what has happened? He has been nominated for the Supreme Court. There is little question about his judicial philosophy. He is an ideologically pure individual. His record speaks for itself

Madam Speaker, the term ``Republican excuse for no budget'' is nothing more than a used car company's own phrase for a bill that has already been served on the House Committee on Budget and the House Appropriations Committee by both of the two offices which I am here to represent. Nowhere is this GOP majority an example of Speaker Newt Gingrich's lust for destroying the deficit in a hurry and unceremoniously tossing around a grand scheme for a welfare daycare center for children.  The Republicans' own Department of Education Council has already warned us that the Gingrich package is a profoundly damaging blueprint for the future of

But if we rely solely on CBO, the nonpartisan nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, to tell us whether or not health care reform will ultimately succeed, then we will be deceived, right?

This is an election year, and we have Democrats and Republicans fighting over who can have the most seats in this body, and we need a simple, straightforward nominee to be our Vice President. And with Democrats showing great enthusiasm for the President and his nominee, as well as with the Senate Republican Party showing great enthusiasm for Vice President Cheney, I don't know what has happened.

The Bush administration, obviously not wanting to face this responsibility themselves and oath, is willing to assist us.  I do believe this bill contains an excellent solution to a difficult problem. I cannot support a bill that offers no money for the Department of Labor.

It would establish a public list of the contractor's private sector operations and the number of contractors that are currently operating the service fleet.  This bill does not provide Federal employees with the ability to learn about the privatization of their jobs, nor does it provide them with clear and accurate information on how privatization affects their pay, benefits, or working conditions. This amendment, the Public Good Contracting Transparency Act, would require Congress to actively engage in efforts to
