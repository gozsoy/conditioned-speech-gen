Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I speak in opposition to the amendment, and the proponents of it.  I have listened to the debate over the last few hours, and I have come to the conclusion that we are going to get an amendment in here that deals with telecommunications in the same way we have gotten consumer protection in the previous bill. This is what we are going to talk about today in this bill today. That is the regulation that the telecommunications industry has to abide by when they want to do business with a business entity that is owned by a company that is a foreign business. It is one of the toughest regulations in telecommunications law. It is one of the hardest regulatory requirements that has ever been imposed on the industry. It says that in America, businesses will not be able to do business with

If supply and demand is the major way to deal with speculation, I believe the Department of the Interior would have to take this seriously because the United States owns over 15 million acres of public land in the Andes alone and it is our primary hope to recover the oil resources of those areas through conservation measures. In addition to oil and gas resources in the Andes, the creation of this new Bureau of Land Management could also help bring new energy and water supplies to the region through the potential for increased electricity generation from the new projects in the Andes alone and even possibly through other means. The Office of the Secretary of the Interior has the authority to issue grants and take other action to ensure that this project has the appropriate support and the appropriate consideration in the national interest and that it has an economic impact to the entire Nation.

And the gentleman is correct that there have been some issues of this project in the past and we need to get back to that because it is not going to happen now. But this is a program which has gone through fiscal years prior to September 11 which is controversial and highly controversial and which should be evaluated by the full committee and the House as to whether it is in the national interest.  The committee has not taken that review. We now have the fiscal year 2004 appropriations which was approved in committee as far as appropriations and the chairman of the committee's jurisdiction.

The so-called President's budget cuts spending by $5 trillion, cuts Medicare by $300 billion, cuts education by $10 billion and cuts the environment by more than $5 billion. The so-called Republican budget plan is the wrong course for this country. The Senate has already approved the next step in the fall legislative schedule, and it is a straight-upup or down vote on the Republican budget. The three-pronged approach is the real way to start the second session of the 107th Congress in January. The Republican budget sets forth a plan to balance the budget in 7 years.

Police officers, COPS, also help to interdict and apprehend violent criminals as part of the local community. Under the COPS program, local governments get support from the Federal Government to help fund technology for officers to conduct drug interdictions.

At that time, I was the only Democratic and Republican Senator from the Eastern European country of Belarus to vote for President Lukashenka.  President Lukashenka stepped up to the challenge with decisive leadership in putting together the agenda for Belarus and in helping to solve the problems that were preventing the country from achieving its original national goals, as set forth

I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for allowing this inquiry. As the Senator is aware, there was an attempt in January by the administration to shut down the Government over the Medicare part A Program that provides preventive services to senior citizens. As the Senator is aware, the proposal was based upon several poor-faith negotiations that were in the process of being completed as part of the budget negotiations. The people of Massachusetts and other States were anxious to move on a bill that would do what they all thought was right for their State and provide affordable care for our seniors. This time, the administration asked for a change in the law to allow it to continue to function under the temporary continuing resolution which I first introduced in the Senate, and it was based upon changes in Medicare that the administration and its representatives were developing and that I was convinced the public

As an original cosponsor of this amendment to change the Federal Government's interest rate policy, I agree with the views of those who have told us that vouchers are not a good idea for our schools, that vouchers do not improve education for students, and vouchers in some cases do not get children into the best schools and allow more students to have parents in their homes. So I am concerned that vouchers may contribute to a welfare-like system in our schools, and make it more difficult to provide appropriate education for the people who need it most.  Let me point out that this bill does not eliminate the Department of Education. The reason for that is a

As I said before, it is true that I think a great deal of common sense is involved in the treatment of a Member of Congress. But do we really want to just say that this medical evidence, by its nature, is reliable? Or do we have to pick out a group of doctors that we think has some credibility based on studies and trials?

The budget resolution we are considering this week cuts $330 billion from the nondefense discretionary accounts and an additional $400 billion from the interest on the debt over the next 7 years. In addition to these cuts, we are dealing with the trend toward growing government by increasing spending on everything from taxes to infrastructure to border security to housing and to public health. By raising taxes and reducing services and allowing for even more spending to be borrowed from the trust funds and accumulated in new Federal taxes and borrowing, this tax and spending expansion means that the budget will exceed the debt limit in 2012 and the cost of Government will reach nearly $1 trillion by the year 2014. The result will be the largest budget deficit

For that reason, I have worked with the gentleman in the past to increase the amount of pay for these officers. He has done a fabulous job in that regard.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to engage the esteemed chairman in a colloquy concerning language that was added to the bill today that my committee will be offering later in the day to remove the draconian deficit reduction formula which is included in this bill and all of the other tax cuts contained in the bill. The language that was added is a direct attack on those who are working to reform our Nation's capital budget for people like my good friend and colleague from California, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.  The Federal Government continues to be mired in a deep deficit. The resulting massive budget deficits have been highly detrimental to not only our nation's economic growth but to the well-being of the American people as well.  One particularly harmful aspect of the so-called so-called so-called capital budget problem is that the Congress

Mr. Speaker, Democrats like tax cuts, too, but the Democratic Party's tax policies are targeted at those Americans who can least afford it. They favor a tax cut that benefits the very people they have labeled greedy and out-of-touch. Tax cuts for the rich are the policies of the past that have led to the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and have led to the highest unemployment in decades. It is one of the few policies of the past that has brought the Federal Government to this point today and has raised the deficit and the debt to the stratosphere.  Our Democratic proposals today provide much needed relief to those Americans who cannot afford it while continuing to help our middle class families as we go after the costs of the massive new tax on the middle class.

The Committee on Commerce is proposing to substitute its own highly specialized ``diversity of thought'' for the guidelines established in the Broadcast Decency Act of 1984 by inserting content standards so heavily weighted in the hands of one ideological group and so narrowly tailored that they will keep most of the public in the dark about the content of the programming they are picking through their airwaves. I want to point out that the guidelines already developed for obscenity have ensured that the public will not be able to accurately and fairly evaluate the content of programs on the airwaves

Mr. Chairman, I come to the floor today to pose an important question to this House. And that is do the American people have an interest in a Federal commission that is controlled by the administration and by the Department of Defense?  Now, the budget of the American people is not even a serious and important issue to this House. It is a business which the President and the Democratic Congress of the United States are continuing to pursue for reasons which are wholly unrelated to the interests of the American people.  Let us think for just a minute about the background of our Presidential budget. The administration has proposed a $3 trillion tax increase. The entire industry of international finance is $3 trillion.  The tobacco companies, at the present time, have annual revenues of $19 billion. So if you are for a $3 trillion tax increase

My friend has observed all the goings-on very closely. The President has acted extraordinarily in this regard to the very difficult situation of the Government of Israel in its time of need and in its time of crisis. Yet it is not very often that the Senate brings legislation to the floor that directly endorses or benefits the President in the ways we have to benefit the President and the Congress in the way in which he has acted in supporting a decision that the Congress in its wisdom or even the President felt should be reached, but without change or without politicizing a decision that was based on the best of all possibilities. In the case of Israel, the best of the best potential might not have been an entirely responsible decision and the best of the best might have been extremely controversial. We all know this.

The people of the United States deserve this legislation that has been put forward by our good friends on the other side of the aisle that have put in time and they have not only the desire to do this and understand what this bill does, but they have been very focused on the fact that Americans deserve some reforms in their tax system so that they are not vulnerable to tax abuse when they move about our country.

He said that one of the problems we have in this country is that we think people are better off at the expense of others. Well, what we have in our Tax Code is a class of people who can see that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I hope you will take a look at this chart. One of the benefits of this Tax Code is that it actually penalizes the working poor.  The reality of the present system is that there are people who are able and the tax code is now in place that allows them to write off the payroll taxes they pay to the Federal Government and write them off in the year of the marriage. But they take out of it the capital gains tax which they

Last Friday, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce reported out a bill to expand the Affordable Care Act. This bill was important to millions of Americans in my home State of Connecticut. Unfortunately, the Senate quickly began debate on an even more radical bill which the Senate will take up today to the end of the week.  We can all agree that Americans should have access to affordable health care. However, we have long debated the current law as being flawed in that it has been largely socialized and managed by Federal bureaucrats while left to the States to regulate itself and expand markets for their own health care policy through their own citizens.

In fact the Russian Government has already announced that they would release more gas supplies to Ukraine if they joined the Moscow gas market. When you stand in line for 2 hours at the Russian market and there is still no gas to go, that means the price of that one kind of gas is not even so reasonable as we could make it.  Fortunately, the Russians are starting to open their gas to the Ukraine. I urge my colleagues to support the Payne amendment.   Pork barrel spending is not a tax, Mr. Chairman.

I would make the same point because it is also very clear to those who have an interest in judicial review of a court decision that it would prevent them from reviewing a court decision that is upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the United States. The State and the Federal governments would be able to use this to the maximum extent possible to keep out legitimate business activity and move them in some other direction. The impact of this would be to open up a whole new type of business activity to be closed down. I believe that is a mistake

The Arapaho Nation will not be forgotten by the many men and women who were a part of this record-setting period in the history of the United States during the First World War. In the first half of the 20th century there were more than two million men and women that served in the military of the United States and one million were killed or wounded in action as a result of their service during this century. It was not only the numerous military operations and conflict that brought about this world war, but the bravery of the Nation during this period by

Mr. Speaker, this bill represents the most bipartisan, open process I have ever seen in my years on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I want to commend our committee chairman, Chairman McCaul, and Ranking Member Lofgren, and our ranking member, Mr. Tonko, for the tremendous job they have done on behalf of the American people on this legislation and the important work they have done to ensure that infrastructure modernization and port security legislation is bipartisan.

First, I'd like to thank and thank our chairwoman, Deborah Pryce, for her leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor. It is a pleasure to cosponsor this resolution with the House.  On February 9, 2004, Congress passed the National Homeownership and Family Preservation Act of 2005 to promote the goals and ideals of National Homeownership Month. Through this resolution, we reaffirm the Federal Government's support for the homeownership opportunities that families possess today.  In general, we all support the goals and ideals of National Homeownership Month because it provides a national opportunity to promote and preserve a family's home for their children and grandchildren.

Mr. President, on many occasions I have taken the floor to talk about agriculture in the Senate farm bill and its important role in our economy. I rise today to talk about how this important legislation will continue to have an impact on the lives of Americans and the economy that grows them.  In these challenging times we must remember that this country and this Congress have come to be the center of the story. The economy started and still thrives because of the partnership between a strong agricultural sector and the private sector, an industry that creates the vast majority of jobs in America.  It is essential for this country to maintain a strong agricultural sector. We have lost billions of dollars of agriculture products due to food and fiber shortages and the overburdened, mismanaged Federal Government that was created by the crisis. Farmers all over America are out

Mr. President, I rise today to continue the debate on this historic opportunity to adopt a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. If we fail to address the problem of government spending, the economy will inevitably suffer. Unless we begin to address the economy through fiscal reforms, our economy will continue to be in a recession and over $1 trillion dollars in deficit over the next 6 years.  I believe the amendment to the Constitution offered by the Senator from West Virginia provides the only long-term plan to balance the Federal budget.  The District of Columbia currently spends $6.6 billion a year in Federal Government spending, which is more than twice what the District of Columbia spends on its own core functions such as police and fire protection. While other Federal expenditures in the District's budget are declining, the District's core budget

As a former member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, I must acknowledge that we in the Congress have traditionally been reluctant to join forces with President Bush on appropriations bills, especially on bills that are so important to our national security interests. In these circumstances, I am deeply concerned that Congress has demonstrated clearly what this administration is willing to do in the national security arena. I believe that Congress should not approve the supplemental appropriations for Iraq which can only contribute to future failures to achieve a proper relationship with Iraq in this increasingly dangerous area.  That brings us to today's bill that I voted against. The legislation contains an unprecedented amount

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Senate amendments to H.R. 4994, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act. This Medicare bill provides strong funding for patient care in America and to help seniors who need it. The bill increases Medicare premiums by $500 for a patient with a family of three to help pay for their health care needs. These funds go directly to doctors and nurses.  Additionally, the bill increases rates for older Americans by 10 to 13 percent, which will mean increased premiums for seniors. The current Medicare law is paid for by both raising taxes on those making over $250,000 and providing seniors a tax break. I am proud to work with my colleagues in Congress to continue to strengthen Medicare and help our seniors save and protect their health care.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

As a member of the National Committee on State and Local Government and the House Committee on Resources Subcommittee on Constitutional Issues, I understand the impact these issues have on the Senate and on local government across the country and the important work that AFSCME does to strengthen the quality of government in our Nation and in our local communities.  Over the years, the contributions of AFSCME and other civil rights and labor unions to community organizing and election reform have been debated, debated and debated in Congress. A significant percentage of House Members have introduced resolutions in support of their position,

The rule does allow the chairman of the Committee on Rules to discuss the Democratic bill in the Committee of the Whole when it comes to immigration reform.

If I can get the attention of Senator Chafee, last night, Senator Bingaman, my colleague on the floor of the Senate on the Appropriations Committee, called attention to the fact that if the Interior appropriations bill were not approved by this Congress last night, the Department of Interior would not be able to spend all of the $6 billion in authorization money that it needs. He said he could not believe how much the President had to ask for a gold mine in the Upper Gulf of Mexico. I will tell the Senator, if this were not a very important area of the interior, there would not have been $5.2 billion in appropriations for it last year.  I read, as the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Harkin and I did a week ago, that one major industrial, not-for-profit organization, the company

Mr. Speaker, for the sake of clarification, there is no assumption in our budget resolution that the budget resolution provision also provides for any reconciliation bill that would include both the President's fiscal year 2020 budget resolution and the resolution submitted to the Congress for reconciliation by Congress. There is nothing in our resolution that provides that if a reconciliation bill is submitted to Congress for reconciliation reconciliation, the reconciliation bill also includes the Senate reconciliation reconciliation bill or that reconciliation bill is subject to the Congressional Budget Office scoring of the Senate reconciliation bill. So our budget resolution does not give the Speaker, the majority leader, the opportunity to decide how much money we should spend to make sure that we have the revenue necessary to complete our job of addressing our entitlement and debt problems. It doesn't give the majority leader the opportunity to make those decisions if they want to have the most robust

Yet most Americans have not yet had the chance to vote on their part of the Congressional health care reform bill.

The reason that this provision is not relevant to the underlying amendment is because the rule is silent on how often this ought to be considered under that rule. I am not a lawyer, and I am not in the business of public policy; but I believe that section 1201 provides the Congress with the ability to ``take appropriate action to provide for the protection of the interests of the public if there are circumstances that threaten the life or physical well-being of a member of the House and of another Member of the House as a result of a breach of this trust.''

Mr. Chair, if I might just say briefly, the notion that Congress can just do whatever it wants with funding that should go to the agencies that have been nominated is the biggest mistake that I think has been made in the last several decades in Congress. When they work for the appropriations committee, and the financial thing being said by some is some institution is overfunded or should be overfunded or any number of things, that should be accepted as settled law. Congress should not play political football with Federal spending that is already in the past or the continuing budget resolution, or any other important policy issue where it would help to prevent further Government waste or neglect. That is what this amendment does. It is not a hard freeze on funding or what that funds, and we should encourage private sector action on the research and development initiatives that make sense,

That is because this budget is $100 billion above the current year's deficit. That $100 billion will probably be put into Medicare and Social Security in 3 years. But then we are talking $100 billion over 6 years, for a total of $200 billion over 10 years--$200 billion over 10 years. That is $700 billion in deficits and $200 billion in debt.

It really is not about what we want to do for the next few days or next few weeks. What we are talking about is the next 4 years, and I think that is important.

Mr. President, it has been 19 days today--19 days--since the House of Representatives impeached the President of the United States and the two-time World War II hero who had done the country so much good in that time. The American people deserve, no less than all Americans, the truth.  After 19 days of here and now, the President's friends in the minority finally began to tell the American people the truth.  A month ago, in his inaugural address, President Bush said: Let the evidence be clear, this is not a decision about one man. It is a decision about the direction this country should take. I am not here to judge anyone for whatever reason. We all have our own personal views about this and we should have our own independent opinion on the matter.

The need to create an infrastructure that can support the transportation needs of our country has never been more critical than today. Indeed today the industry is in the most critical period of its history. Any potential threat to the financial stability of these businesses is due to their role as the world's largest source of revenue and the largest individual purchasers of transportation.

A similar provision in the Senate passed Labor-HHS bill that is now before the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs cuts veterans programs in half for fiscal year 2012.

Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill for an appropriation account. It therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.  The amendment proposes to amend existing law with reference to reimbursement of employee travel costs, transportation services, and meals, and includes language extending reimbursement to employers providing prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and other similar services to employees in excess of the reimbursement allowed under the exemption in clause 2(C) of rule XXI.  The amendment proposes to

President Bush will make a statement on Monday at 10 a.m. and for 3 hours and then be back at the White House later in the day to announce his decision on this President pro tempore. We have open debate today.  You have one of the most important decisions a President has to make in his or her first term. If you are a Republican, you like open and real debate. But you know that we are here to defend the President and the President's words that he will not have this health care plan that the American people have sent him over there.  So you had 30 days to consider what the American people wanted when they sent him over there. So for us to speak on

Mr. Speaker, under current law, the county controls these 32 acres of Federal land, but not all the Federal lands that are in that county do, so the county still owns all the land in that county and if you want to take one of these 33 acres of Federal land out of that county, that is fine with the county. But if you want to sell it and you want to put it up for sale again at the market price or whatever it is on the market price, you still have that jurisdiction because it is not the county that is actually in the county.  But this bill takes Federal lands and makes them the property of the county, and this bill takes the power away from the people and puts it back in the hands of the State.

Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 1994, legislation to allow the VA to continue paying the public interest rate of 6 percent on interest that it owes the Federal Government on the debt of the United States of America for the Department of Veterans Affairs, to an increase of 1 percent every year for the next 7 years from the current rate of 6.8 percent to 7.8 percent for the next 2 years. This legislation will allow the Secretary of the VA to continue the practice of paying these rates in this country for the first 7 years of this Administration and allow the American people to have greater say in how the VA is being paid for its unmet obligations to the public and the American people today.  I think it is also important to note that this first step on the road to using a more responsible fiscal policy for the

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, 4 years ago, amid concerns of hostile treatment against Israel at the United Nations, the Bush administration asked for additional Israeli assistance against Palestinian terrorism by providing $50 million to the State Department for development of counter-intelligence capabilities to the United Nations. This assistance was granted to keep the terrorist activities of Hamas and other Palestinian factions at bay while the administration was providing assistance to the State of Israel which sought no more aid from hostile United States governments.  I have no doubt that this money will be spent in that manner when Congress acts. My congressional district includes many small towns and villages where State Department officials work closely with local police and other community leaders to combat drug and human trafficking and other serious problems in those areas. I am certain that the local law enforcement and social services are doing their part to keep residents safe by coordinating the drug

Mr. President, before I answer this question, there is one further response I want to make to it. We have had a continuing resolution for over 10 months, a continuing resolution that Congress has done nothing with or come to the Senate floor with and have passed without debate. So there has been a continuing appropriations bill that Congress passed without debate that is now on the floor in the Senate with votes that have not been permitted in the Senate and was passed on the Senate floor as an emergency measure. It is kind of like if you are in a Senate committee with 20 Members on both sides and you try to get everybody to sit down and work out an agreement.  My point is the Senate rules are the Senate rules, not the President's rules or Senator Kennedy's rules, and if we were to take this up and vote on it on

These rules represent my administration's efforts to make sure that our young people--particularly young women, students, and families--understand what security is all about.  Let me be clear: the underlying legislation here is a positive step forward. We are creating a number of new technical rules designed to protect American networks. That is good. It is an effort to keep our Nation secure. What we are attempting to do is to build in that first base of risk management--to meet an increasing security threat that is all too real.

I will tell you why we need to get to it. We have more jobs in this country today than ever before in our history and if the economy continues on its present path we could be looking at a reduction in unemployment of nearly one-third. In the long term it is possible to create more jobs because our Government does not spend money and it does not do the things that have created a three-quarters growth in our economy over the last decade or so that we are concerned about today. So we are not dealing with this as we get into the area of the stimulus package. There is a potential

This important legislation is a bill that will ensure the Federal Government has the tools necessary to protect its most valuable employees, our Federal employees. These legislation takes an important step in ensuring our Federal employees are protected from personal harm as well as the Government from wrongdoing when they work for the Federal Government or a Federal agency. It also takes an important step in ensuring that employees are provided the same protections as other Federal employees, that is, the opportunity to be covered under our health plans which include free and discounted health insurance, as well as the ability to form and join a health savings account so that their tax dollars will not be spent to pay for private health insurance policies provided for by the government.

One Senator who was present is actually speaking at this moment.

The taxes would have to be paid from the time that Medicare costs start out declining. It would be paid by Medicare beneficiaries, but all the beneficiaries would pay it. Then the taxes would come in, in a variety of ways, but more than 50 percent of Medicare costs would come in taxes. And if you take the tax revenues that would come in as a result of those taxes, and these taxes go to pay off deficit reduction, you have a savings of $200 billion in Medicare spending.

But all the kids, not just the Republican kids but the American kids, the good-government kids, will understand that it means to ``us.'' The best news in all of this is not to change the Pledge of Allegiance but to remove all of the regulations that are keeping our government and our government departments from doing what is good for our country. All of the jobs, all of the jobs, good-government jobs will be saved if we really say the Pledge of Independence and the Pledge of Rights and ask everyone to do the same thing as they are supposed to

He will ask to borrow money, and the Congress will say, Federal dollars must be repaid. Now if this does not happen on its own terms, then our military will have the same savings on their personnel as if we had bought them the same amount of private sector companies that were going to come to work and work and work but have fewer jobs and have less costs. This is why the war is going to continue to cost us more money and more men and women will die than if we buy those companies. And

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act, legislation which will enable cancer patients and survivors to take care of their sickle cell anemia by providing access to funding through the CMS Family Provider Services account and through other Government medical devices accounts.  This is an important initiative for cancer patients and caregivers and they need to be able to pay for it with the funds they earned through a pay period for quality services. Without this legislation, patients and survivors would have to continue to incur high prices for the care that they have so far paid for out of their own pocket in spite of the fact that they cannot afford it on the cost of chemotherapy drugs.  The Community Cancer Care Preservation Act will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries who live in federally managed care plans are able to continue to benefit from coverage for cancer treatments.

The House passed this measure in June by an overwhelming bipartisan margin.  This legislation continues an investment in our Nation's veterans that will provide the higher quality of care and benefits for our returning veterans and their families that they expect. The legislative package before us today is also a tribute to my colleague and friend, Mr. Spence from Louisiana, for his leadership and tireless commitment to service to our Nation's veterans.  This resolution provides $25 million in fiscal year 2008 funding for VA health care and services.

It does not take too much to see that the Democrats say it again. The Democrats say it again that we can get tax increases for the American taxpayers in this Congress if they will just put their money where their mouths are. Democrats say it again that it is OK to increase taxes in this Congress if the budget does not make the Democrats happy.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Veterans Health Care Facilities Capital Improvement Act of 2008 and its companion bill, H.R. 2672. This bill is not a new issue. I have sponsored it in each of the last two Congresses, and I want to recognize the hard work of the people in Pennsylvania who helped us bring this proposal to the floor in a bipartisan manner. We have an opportunity to do this again today and make a significant improvement to the facilities and funding levels of the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System. I commend the subcommittee for providing $10 million to improve the funding structure of the Veterans Health Care Facilities. We are getting there, but it has been a long and hard journey and the Committee on Appropriations is very supportive of the work we are doing.  The American public is beginning to

That is not what the case is here. You are applying two different standards here. One standard is the market value--does that apply to the value of the product and the value of the business or the value of the person that was using the product when the product was made? If it is the value of the product and the value of the business that was involved when the product was made, then the claim is barred because the actual profit of the business is higher than the value of the property. I think that is what is going on here.  Secondly, if it is less than what a law enforcement official would value an asset, then the owner of that asset can argue that it was worth the expense in hiring an independent legal counsel.   cartridges last a long time in California.

As my colleagues are aware, we do not reduce our pay during the year to keep up with our increased costs. Instead, we reduce Federal employees' pay over a certain amount each month to keep up with their work needs in the year to come. Currently, Members pay for their salary in their respective districts through their own budgets.

And if we are to adopt a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, we need a constitutional amendment as well as a budget amendment to force the Congress to balance its budget every year from year to year. We have seen the burden put on the budget deficits of the past from time to time over the years and this burden is one which we have increased today under the Clinton administration and the Republican-controlled Congress of the United States.

Senator Landrieu is essentially giving the President of the United States a blank check to spend whatever they want on the red line if he wants to do that, and he will do it, because it is a cut.  The liberals want the President to spend money for stimulus as if they are doing something. They are not. That is what the budget resolution does. What they want to do is send us a bill that says do this if you have to spend some money for it but do it by saying it is being done on the public health side of our budget.

Many other things people do not pay any tax on are also tax deductible and not taxable. And that is the purpose of the amendment that we are about to vote on. We are saying now this is wrong and we ought to have an amendment to make it right, so that if they earn $10 million a year and they have an annual child care $1

In these circumstances it is more important for us to define what a military operation is than what we are doing to this particular program, and to an extent the aircraft itself does that; that there is a pilot involved and there are training tasks that we are asking to perform that are in many cases not specifically related to that pilot, but is equally relevant to supporting the mission.  The important part is that this makes a decision about whether or not this is going to be what we wanted to be doing with

mpt considered strategy 

Final sequence: 

With respect to the strategy to bring India into the MPT, in our considered judgment, we believe it is not possible to achieve a significant reduction in Indian defense spending without such actions as these and without bringing India into the project through the permanent addition of permanent status as an end user in the global program. Our assessment is that without such action it is difficult to make India an even more effective counterforce to the United States as the original author of the BMD program of the MPT. It is therefore our view that such an aggressive policy must be preceded by a program of gradual policy changes, perhaps as the strategy for the next 7 years is developed, which would either move India further into the program or be an effective means to bring India into the program as an end user in the global program as a whole. And because the question of

And let's just say we can only make the necessary increase if we make that increase in an arbitrary way rather than subject that $500 million to the 10 percent of the economy that could be raised with $5 billion of additional spending, and that would be the new debt limit or whatever it might be and raise that limit not just to a certain amount of money but to a point that might lead to some kind of a specific level so we can add to that level, so we can actually take that $500 million from that $50 billion that we are going to make the debt limit greater than it has ever been.

But on the very first day of the 105th Congress, the Republican majority has put in place another strategy for destroying our most important civil rights law. It is to eliminate the ability of the Federal Government to protect immigrants in this country in the future by passing yet another kind of divisive, partisan and one-sided immigration bill that will be no more than another ideological crusade to crack down on immigrants in this country and that in fact does nothing to improve the already long list of problems the President and

Madam Speaker, three blocks from our White House, the World Bank is subsidizing the administration to war in Iran, even though it has issued millions of dollars in loans to Iran since 2006 that were not needed by the regime at the time the money was issued.  In fact, the State Department has said that no loan should be repaid unless Iran actually violates the terms of the loan. And while every regime for 200 years and every organization for 200 years has followed the same patterns, the administration has instead pursued a no-action policy when it comes to our meddling in the Iranian-American energy and political situation in favor of buying foreign oil instead.  Why does the administration have this policy? Because President Obama thinks it is in our country's interest to have a confrontation with Iran that could spark a Middle Eastern war.

Mr. Speaker, it has been 1 year since House Republicans stood on the west front steps of the Capitol to celebrate the signing of the balanced budget resolution into law with an American people in hand and their hopes fulfilled that we could reach a final agreement. We did so knowing that we could not change the economic landscape of the country in just 1 year, we could not allow our Nation to become more unequal and the Congress to lose the strength it had regained as the economy grew and our Nation emerged from the recession. Yet, Mr. Speaker, what a year it has been for House Republicans.  We stood here on January 9, and Members of the majority would not be here today for an hour. Instead, today we voted for a historic package of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans; gas tax cuts and significant tax relief for small businesses

There would be no impoundment authority under this balanced budget amendment. Under Senate Joint Resolution 71 the balanced budget amendment would apply only if and only if Congress, not the President, adopted a concurrent resolution of the Congress to the effect that the Congress has decided that a balanced budget is in the national interest and to which other measures must be adopted to achieve a joint constitutional balanced budget.  This requires the President to submit to Congress his budget proposed for the balance of 1995. The President must submit that budget to the Congress before the end of May in which Congress may amend or modify the level of spending for the Federal Government.  Any changes made in the President's budget would require at least 60 votes in the Senate. Any amendment to the President's budget which reduces spending more than it increases spending would require at least 60 votes in the Senate.

Instead, we have instead seen a bill that fights to preserve the status quo and debate abuses of legislative power. Instead of fighting to protect the public interest, Congress voted to strip a Senator of her right to file campaign finance reports and to vote on legislation to regulate lobbyists and their activities.  I have no greater responsibility than to defend our Federal agencies from lobbyists and to create a more open and fair Congress.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill, which is of modest substance, which just passed the House on a voice vote, would not permit the Federal Government to institute any new programs in the State of Washington until it receives one project approval from the State Department of Transportation and a State assessment for the project. Now, all we are saying in this legislation is that the Federal Government must get its way on a project before Washington can request it for another project in Washington. Now, that is just another way to say that the Federal Government cannot do its job in Washington.  This bill, in particular, would allow the Federal Government to ban the construction of major hydroelectric dams in Washington. It would also permit the Federal Government to come into the Washington Metropolitan Area and publicize permits and allow for citizen

I have even included the comments of some people that I have spoken to today who have given up their private plans because they are joining this plan.  The good news is that we are here now with a new set of plans that are going to compete against what many of us expect to be the least expensive plan that many of us in this country will ever see offered. We are going to have competition. This plan is not going to be the only option that some, if not most, citizens of Kentucky,

Fortunately, the law-abiding citizen who was not only notified the parents of the boy but also a friend of the boy, was not found in violation of his Second Amendment rights as well. The boy's mother says the officer should have known better. The law-abiding citizen who was in the back of the State police van, not knowing who the cop was, did not want to get involved.

This has to change if we want the next generation to have a safe and secure future for them and their children.

That is a basic falsehood, if we look at the costs associated with our bill. There are much smaller costs in this bill for the rest of our country. It would be much better for the American economy if we all treated it like our own small business.  It is time for an economic analysis that would assess the economic impact of this bill.

Mr. Speaker, when I grew up in Arizona, so many people were talking about wind in Arizona and about how they wanted to invest in this part of the country where it was going to be very significant if people were going to be able to put down roots and to own homes and to build some land and not have to go through all this bureaucracy that has been in place since the founding of our country and why the land and property tax policy, the whole land ownership policy in America was so negative and so bigoted that it was something we could not see coming that would really encourage a little bit more economic growth. So many people had come to Arizona and talked about how they were going to invest and see some real jobs in the business world. This tax, the growth tax, is a very important part of that to promote a business

There are some things that I think are good that can be done, such as the use of the 10 percent of the land that is not subject to private land use but is subject to Federal land use for certain purposes, and also there are some good ideas that could be put into this bill that could make it even better but it is not a perfect bill that I think could make the difference as to whether we should ever do

But let me suggest to our colleagues, there is no intention to delay the vote on the three Democratic amendments. We will try to set up those votes and get them resolved.

He will be a great addition to the Judiciary Committee and the Senate.

But even more important than that, the House is required to take it up as early as possible in the year. It gives the Pentagon much time to prepare and to know that we have all the support that we need to execute on the threat that we face as we do in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are going to take up that legislation as early as we can in the year and continue to work in that area in the months ahead to make sure that it is up to the same standard as every other military authorization bill that we have seen before this Congress in the last 7 years.

In fact, I believe we should do what we can to provide affordable, quality health care for every citizen. While no one is more concerned about addressing this issue than I, it would not have occurred to me to have introduced this bill in the beginning of this year. But now, we have the opportunity to do more to bring real health care reform to America by passing legislation to address the issue of physician reimbursement.  Madam Speaker, on March 17,

I certainly think health plans ought to go in the private market and ensure that the public money goes to the medical plan it would be a mistake for the Medicare money to go to that would be a mistake for the taxpayer to go to.

Of course there are things we can and should do to help the financial system strengthen and get out of this crisis. But what we need to do is to not make any decisions that are based on this letter that will cause all of us on Wall Street and in the Government to end up really making bad decisions and hurting the American people and not making any decisions at all about policy. That is what we need to do.  We are told by the Fed that we are now in a strong financial condition, that we are protected from a

The reason why my friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to support the minimum wage increase is because they cannot buy what they want because the money is there. They have to be willing to hold these jobs in certain parts of the country because we are pushing jobs out of the country because we are spending the money that was sent to us and not being able to save it, or to turn it over to the private sector so that it can go out to those areas where it is needed

And what they are looking at most and what detracts them most is that they really are wedded, first of all, to the concept that it was just made up to be done or that this is a social program, this is anything but just what it is. What they are saying is we have to really think about what we are doing here. Because the whole point of the entitlement program is that we have to try to find ways to pay for something, whether it is Social Security or Medicare or some other thing that we can do, just to accomplish something. What we need to do here is not just this Medicare payment in lieu of payment to the Government, but to find other ways that we can get people into work. It seems to me that the facts are in.

September 11 happened more than one year ago this week to hundreds of thousands of Americans who lost their lives on that day and another almost 200,000 have been wounded or are currently in the hospital. We were all shaken and aghast at the thought of what could have been if that were not such a terrible tragedy. That day opened the doors of this country to all those who are seeking freedom and justice for those who have been oppressed and attacked by terrorists and attacked with intent to kill and maim for another year. That is why I rise today to call for Congress to pass legislation in this Congress to take up a bill that we have introduced with the chairman and ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee and others

He told the world his State would turn around welfare spending by this year and improve its family structure by one-third by creating a new single-parent wage. In Wisconsin, families with three or more children today have an average of $17,000 in debt while working parents in the State today have an average of $15,000 in debt. Half the State's counties have the worst combined credit and financial-status records in the Nation. Since the President came to office in January of 1993, the debt for all Wisconsin families has increased by 42 percent while average wages have fallen by 4 percent.

In a private meeting earlier this year with Chairman Lewis and the leaders of the District of Columbia committee in the House, it was also clear that the District of Columbia does not need any additional assistance

We had hoped to be creating some jobs at a much higher rate than we did. We have one of the lowest unemployment numbers in a decade.  We cannot do anything about job losses, we cannot do anything about our economy if we do not put people back to work and if we cannot provide economic opportunity. The market and individual

Mr. Speaker, ``The soldier is the Army, and wars may be fought with weapons, but they cannot be won by killing men.'' So says the poet D.H. Lawrence. But the Bush administration is now engaged in a war in Iraq based on that same basic theme, using one of the most offensive weapons of the modern age as a part of its overall strategy for Iraq.  Now it is often said that we do not know what the Bush administration is planning in Iraq beyond what they have already announced to the American people in congressional hearings. But I believe that these days we are being told what the Bush administration is planning to do in Iraq so that the American people will be in on the game. And that is exactly the result of a recent document which was handed to the Nation by the Bush administration in advance of its June 6th

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and the school as an institution that has recently been recognized by the Governor of Utah as an institution of national significance. UT Health Sciences is a leader in medical technology and health care delivery and provides an especially unique opportunity for education in all aspects of health care--preexisting, emerging and emerging technologies, health systems and quality of life issues. While many innovative health technologies and innovation organizations rely on patient-centered solutions to many problems, a traditional training program for experienced medical technicians and an integrated integrated chain of care provides a unique experience for physicians and health care professionals. As a result of these efforts to transform the delivery of medical care and providing support to emerging technologies, UT Health Sciences has developed an impressive curriculum and infrastructure that includes 12 programs that involve medicine

It is a very critical time in their lives where they are looking to their children and saying to their children, well, how have you been over these years, how have you been doing in school? How have you been doing in the work force as well as your job?  Madam Speaker, there are some wonderful things happening in this country. We do have a terrific economy and job creation in our country. We have learned that hard work pays off for all Americans. We have learned that hard work pays off for all people in our country.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Brooks amendment. I opposed the Gallego amendment before it was offered to restrict non-Federal-funded projects in the amendment. Although I support the legislation in its present form, and would support the legislation as amended if it were enacted into law as amended, I believe the time to act is now.  The issue that the Brooks amendment raises is the question of the consideration of national interests in approving projects that may or may not have Federal-interest considerations. I agree that some projects should be approved that will provide the only source of permanent jobs for Americans, as well as provide as many jobs as possible on the basis of private sector pay and benefit analysis or industry standards. I recognize that these are sensitive matters, but I cannot justify requiring Federal-regional benefits analysis before approving such a project.

Madam President, a recent study from Harvard suggested that the actual death toll in Puerto Rico during the Puerto Rican Independence Day Island Redeployment has now reached the highest in the history of the United States military presence in the region. That is bad news, not only because of the number of innocent men, women and children who are killed in combat and the 30,000 individuals that are injured who are subject to severe disabilities and the many other tragic injuries that this administration has created in the area of the damage caused by the Federal Government's military presence, but also because the United States Government is ultimately responsible for creating or continuing the uncertainty in that area of the Pacific as to where Puerto Rico will be.  For a number of years now, the situation has been bad in the South, bad in the Northeast and bad in the West

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a response to the concerns of the one section in our bill regarding the Black Panthers and the Little League system in particular. The amendment basically bans the use of money to support or expand the Little League or to support the Black Panthers or any other organization that uses violent tactics. It would prohibit the use of funds from the Social Security Administration for organizations that use violence to achieve political objectives or to intimidate other people in the process of political activities.  We are dealing here not only with the funding of certain groups of people for political activities but the funding of other groups of people who are not involved in political activities to engage in violence and intimidation. I have a letter from the ACLU that says that the ACLU supports the bill because it takes steps to prevent violence

That is why I have introduced legislation called the Protecting Social Security and Medicare from Deficit Reduction Act.  The Reform the Public Housing Complex Act of 1995 restores fiscal fairness by combining multiple Federal housing programs into one managed program. This will assist in the disposition of government public housing properties through better management and cost efficiency. Additionally, we restore the assurance that public housing programs that were set to close before 2001 will not be eliminated.

This week we will be bringing attention to the Republican Congress in this Chamber and will be increasing tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans by $600 billion over the next decade and putting those tax cuts to work increasing unemployment benefits so families who are looking for work can find it. We have deficit spending that has gone on longer and now a shameful 38 months since the Speaker last met with our President. Yet here we are when we are talking about bringing jobs back.

Mr. President, some of you may know about the terrible tragedy that occurred near Glenwood Springs in North Carolina last month and it is a tragedy we all share.  As many of my colleagues know, when the 9/11 attacks began, there was a very high level of interest in this area in North Carolina. Hundreds of American troops from North Carolina and New Mexico were stationed there, in most cases trained and deployed there with the 21st Combat Aviation Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. The events of the month and the two deaths near Glenwood Springs raised further questions about our Nation's response in North Carolina and across the country to the terrorist threat that we were facing in the post-9/11 era. And so the region from North Carolina now has the distinction of being the second most densely populated area in the country after

Title VI is designed to allow forests and lands to act as public utilities, to provide water and sewer, water supply and water treatment, timber harvest, logging, recreation and other uses in such a way that we can dispose of them properly and lawfully.  However, Federal agencies have failed to justify and correctly interpret these safeguards when public resources are being sought. For example, the Forest Service has not justified its decision to impose an interruption in the use of 400 acres of Cape Fear National Forest, Florida, by seizing and setting aside an erodible relic under the Florida timber law, or by demanding a

Today I told the senior Senator from Illinois about the visit I had yesterday with the senior Senator from California and the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives in the other body about the use of the $80 billion in this country for Head Start by the same person and the activities of the National Institutes of Health in that city as opposed to as well in Washington State and even in the rest of the country that are spending $7 billion of taxpayers' money for some of the same education programs that have been found to be so devastating for the children in the first years of Head Start and for their parents in the second years of Head Start. I know the senior Senator has been involved in a debate over Head Start for the last year and a half.  I told him we have to make sure this issue gets no further down

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation at hand, which includes the Retirement, Pension and Investment Funds for Employees Act of 2005. This bill would make technical changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to make provisions for private pension plans available in most pension plans that are other than defined benefit plans as of the filing date of such plans. It includes an exemption for funds that are otherwise qualified pension plans because they are private pension plans and not employees plan funds, and it increases the pension fund financing requirement from $50 billion to $100 billion, or $8 billion less annually. It gives private pension plans exemption from mandatory monthly premiums in most defined benefit pension plans.  The investment fund provisions allow private pension plans to use the savings from investment funds for investment purposes or to reduce asset management expenses. The pension fund financing provision allows

Mr. President, I simply make the observation that the offering of this amendment by the Senator from Maine does not do away with the provision of the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill for OIF. The amendment does not simply eliminate the Government at risk from emergency funds. It simply eliminates that contingency fund. This bill simply continues the President's request that the Government be at risk from providing money to the overseas contingency fund, which is a regular fund that our overseas contingency funds are now paid into and that is usually funded from revenue.  The offset from savings provided to the deficit reduction fund would simply be converted into savings in other agencies where the savings are required. As I said, it would simply simply be converted into savings.  So in this matter of conference, we simply intend to take away from the supplemental appropriation the savings that our offset would

Mr. Speaker, the definition of obstruction in the dictionary is ``a thing that impedes or prevents the completion of what the intended object is.'' For example, in my view obstruction to the consideration of a bill cannot impede passage of the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.  We may differ over whether Government shutdowns are healthy or not, and I disagree with my friend on both counts. But I am frustrated that some Members of this body would slow-walk important legislative pieces of legislation in order to prevent funding for the Department of Homeland Security from becoming law.  This shutdown is a red herring. It should be a big red herring. The appropriations bill is yet to be completed. Had we not kept an impasse and were able to reach an agreement on that bill and reduce the importance of delaying the Department of Homeland Security's funding

Mr. President, I oppose the passage of the Omnibus appropriations conference report. The bill before us is ill-timed and counterproductive. The conference committee is all about funding for the government's biggest obligations. Federal agencies continue to underfund critical safety and security programs. On top of that, they provide no funding for essential programs for our Nation's poor. The provisions in the omnibus bill, or section 201, allow for some of the most egregious spending increases in American history--of which more than half will go to salaries and expenses. It is for these reasons that I oppose this measure.  Mr. President, the President's proposal for fiscal year 1995 budget cuts most funding to the environmental, Federal medical, and education programs by $1.7 billion. This number reflects the largest priority reductions for the programs in the President's proposal

In 1882, William Landmeyer purchased the Pierre Lyle farm near Sillum and located it within the present town limits of Frankfort. A few years later, the future citizens of Frankfort were relocated to Iona. In 1883, Charles J. Pitts donated the land for a minor school and then named the town Iona after Patrick Henry's house. In 1909, the name of the town changed to Frankfort to honor two Frankfort students, Charles F. McElhaney and William D. O'Grady, who all graduated from Iona High School

You mentioned the personal savings accounts and the payroll tax cut. The payroll tax cut is going to cost us about $20 billion a year over the next 10 years from what is actually going to happen.

A January 2010 Chicago Tribune poll of 1,000 community residents reported that 66 percent of adults are enthusiastic about volunteerism. This is greatly encouraging and is an indicator that participation in a volunteer organization like the FFA can actually improve the quality of life for the over 2.7 million members.  Throughout its history, the U.S. FFA has been an international organization, hosting events in more than 100 countries.

Is that in the spirit of accommodation?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

legislation comprehensive week 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, to go back, earlier this morning I spoke of the immigration hearings we were having last week on the bill Senator Leahy and I introduced last Congress. And some of those hearings focused on two particular issues: immigration reform legislation and the need to address the comprehensive bill that Senator Leahy and I are working on today, Senate Concurrent Resolution 35, the Deficit Reduction and Contract With America, or the Contract. This bill represents a reform agenda that, while it contains many elements of legislation in previous Congresses, it also represents a historic shift in our approach toward resolving our Nation's fiscal problems.  The hallmark of both the Leahy-Wyden immigration reform bill and the Concocted deficit reduction bill is a monumental shift from large, inefficient government programs, to a competitive market system, to a humane society

Mr. Chairman, my amendment today aims to protect private property rights of farmers and ranchers in California by requiring public hearings on farm and ranch land transfers in the second fiscal year of the California plan.  Mr. Chairman, this process is so well established and it is necessary to the success of any agriculture plan as it moves through the public process prior to the Federal Government implementing a project. This requirement is necessary because many times the farmer or rancher will agree to a transfer for whatever environmental reasons they have given the landowner.  But when such a transfer occurs the landowners have no real right to have their rights preserved or determined in the future.  Now, some farmers do very well on lands purchased for development as they convert them to cattle or sheep. Yet many of these farmers have learned that transferring land to these crops is a no

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], and I thank him for offering this very important amendment in the nature of a substitute.  I have a number of concerns about the Obey amendment. One is the fact that the committee gave the Bureau of Reclamation the authority to make special use of facilities in certain areas of public lands without a permit but gave it to them only if they are in an emergency or if the facilities provide drinking water for the public. This is an issue I have a great deal of concern about and one that this subcommittee has worked out with the chairman of the full committee and the other members of this committee on a number of occasions.

So basically this would best be described as a win-win all the way around. It's an agreement that would be for one group of people in the Federal Government and would be for another group of people in the State government to say that all Federal employees are going to be covered by this package that they have to have in order to have access to the Federal Government health plan and private insurance reform so that those of us who are pro-government in the Federal Government are going to be included in the work force that the administration and Members of this body want, they want us to be excluded from.  And, no, I won't say to the distinguished gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Kaptur) that as far as I'm concerned she has offered a good public-private bill.  The CHAIRMAN. The time of

Madam Speaker, during the past 40 years, we have made tremendous progress in America technologically, socially and economically. There are many obstacles and tremendous obstacles that still remain to our future success. We cannot think of any place in the world where a civilization that has been such a strong and prosperous country for so many decades has so many difficulties that still challenge our years-long vision of a great and happy Nation.  In many ways, I rise in support of this bill which restores our economy to strength by reducing tax rates for working families, and continuing research that is directly addressing medical advances that will save millions of lives and save millions of dollars in the long term.  Madam Speaker, I want to begin by applauding our colleague and my dear friend, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Traficant] for his very long term

Madam President, I come to the floor today to voice my opposition to Mr. Nussle's nomination to be Secretary of Agriculture for the second time in this Congress, and in the past 2 years for the first time in more than a decade. I have always been concerned about the need to improve the farm bill and make reforms to the farm program that we are spending billions of dollars to create a new bureaucracy and mandate.  As chairman of the Agriculture Committee I have repeatedly expressed my concern over the current farm funding levels and the heavy-handed way these decisions are made. When I was chairman of the committee, I actually insisted on the largest food program cut in the history of the program, and I saw the farm bill come to a complete stop. Our country's supply of food is in crisis.  Now, instead of supporting reform to help
