But the President of the United States was elected in 2008 because President Obama promised the American people that his Presidential campaign would be about change, not change for the sake of change. He promised the American people that he would bring change to Washington and bring it to Washington's people, not change for the sake of change.  The problem was that he and the Democrats in the Senate had passed legislation, as did the Republican-controlled House, that would have had devastating consequences for families all across America.

Americans have been working hard all year to obtain these states of higher education because they want to increase the percent of people with the skills and experience needed to compete in the global economy.  Unfortunately, the number of people who graduate with a high school diploma or higher is on the decline. That is especially true in the South, where some 20 percent of all African-American students drop out of high school. In many cases, they do not graduate from high school at all.

These same people want to protect American jobs by protecting American farmers and manufacturers and American workers from trade barriers, but they are not interested in protecting American jobs when it comes to trade deals.

Mr. President, 3 years ago, the country of Belarus held a presidential election that marked--instead of the President of the United States--the international community's first official step in lifting the arms embargo that had controlled the country since World War II. Federation Day in Belarus is celebrated each year on April 14. The Belarusian people celebrate this momentous occasion by celebrating the upcoming election.  Since the 1992 elections in the former Soviet Union, the United States and the international community have worked to facilitate the peaceful transition of power in Belarus, which is the only former Soviet republic in Europe to have elected its first President. The fact that the Government of Belarus, unlike the former Soviet Union, does not possess a military, as was the case in Russia, makes it an attractive candidate for a closer relationship with the international community.  The Government of Belarus has

I am sure we all agree that welfare reform is an important step in the right direction.  In recent years, however, the policy has been to treat welfare recipients more as a consumer product rather than as a citizen. In essence, the Federal Government has become a subsidized agency. In other words, it is subsidizing the recipients of welfare, the consumer, not the taxpayer.  Mr. President, we must be careful about what we do and do not support. We have a lot of important decisions to make as a country. It is important to ensure that welfare recipients have access to quality education,

businesses recession chamber 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, it has become clear that our health care debate is entering the twilight of its historic years and that our Chamber must take some important steps to improve the health care services we provide to all Americans and businesses. Unfortunately, the current health care system has many problems that are more severe than the recession or other economic setbacks.  A small number of high-income, healthy individuals will continue to be able to obtain health care coverage through their employers, and the policies that they purchase will be among the most generous in the country. In fact, the cost of health insurance is expected to increase significantly in the next few years.  It is difficult to imagine a more fundamental change in our country's health care system than allowing millions of Americans to purchase private insurance that provides universal coverage. We can all agree that we need to make health

He has said that the President wants to keep government open. He has said that the President wants to shut down the government. And the President has said that he wants to keep the government open and open only for good people who work hard and play by the rules.  The fact is, Mr. President, what you are doing is creating a dangerous situation. What you are doing is you are ignoring the needs of the American people.

The Senator from California was here earlier, so she knows what that means.  So, Mr. President, the Senator from California has stated the situation.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Goss amendment. The amendment offered by the Members of this body would provide support to our military personnel. Specifically, the amendment prohibits unauthorized military construction projects, including unauthorized military personnel construction projects, from being funded under this bill, unless specifically authorized by Congress.  I want to thank Chairman Goss for his commitment to national security and to provide for our military personnel. I am grateful for his willingness to work with the subcommittee to provide the funds for our military personnel.  Mr. Chairman, the bill provides $53 million in base closure and realignment funds. While this bill provides for a greater percentage of construction than was requested by the administration, I believe that this bill has the right priorities.  I believe that this bill adequately funds military housing. The majority has recognized the importance of this

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express--in no uncertain terms--that I will not support President Clinton's so-called budget for 1995 because it is a massive increase in spending above the rate of inflation and increases the rate of growth in the interest rate on the debt over that rate rise of the economy. But the budget before us is even worse than that because it will increase the number of lost jobs and express the feeling that Congress has no alternative but to raise taxes.  Let me explain the reasons why. First, as we have seen, over the last 7 years the Republican majority has tried to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. This means a significant reduction in the number of Federal employees. As a result, we have been losing more jobs in this country than we have gained. This has been happening at a time when the

The way the China trade agreement was drafted, it is very clear that if the President wanted to extend the agreement, he could do so.

The OECD has said that a program that spends $3.2 billion on a tax cut at a time when we are already in the throes of a recession, when we are $4.6 trillion in debt, when we have some of the highest unemployment in this country, that is a bad idea. They say it is counterproductive.  Now, it has been my experience that when we get involved in something, it is very counterproductive to get involved in it and not have a serious debate about what we are doing and how we are doing it.

I thank the gentleman for the time and for his leadership on this very important issue for our country and for all of the hard work that he put in over the last year and a half in this Chamber and in the other body and in the competition that we have had in this regard.  I rise to oppose this arbitrary, arbitrary shutdown. It's just not going to work. We are about to have a vote in the Senate on the continuing resolution that funds the government for the rest of the year, and this will be the last vote we will have on that issue, and that's a shame. We should be considering the appropriations bills for the rest of the year.  We need to take care of our Nation's needs, including border security, and

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues from New Hampshire and Pennsylvania in Congress to discuss the need to meet the President's Executive order on the health care reform bill and Speaker Pelosi's threats of a veto.  There is a lot of talk about the fact that there is no reform. This is a pretty broad debate. The President of the United States has said, ``There is no reform.'' We have heard that rhetoric before. He has said it over and over again.  There is no reform. Speaker Pelosi has said that reform is not in this bill. I think we all know that, but she has not really stated it.  There is a lot of talk about the mandate. There is a lot of talk about the paperwork. There is a lot of talk about the self-enforcing requirements. There

department states act 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is designed to ensure that States have the flexibility they need to act on State Department waste, fraud, and abuse cases. The bill, H.R. 2350, would clarify the application of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act and Federal Property Law to the District of Columbia.  This bill is not a substitute for any legislation the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight has considered or passed in the past, but it does provide some clarification on what the intent of the law is.  Currently, in many instances, the law is unclear as to the extent to which the District of Columbia is subject to the definition of a State or foreign power. This confusion has been caused by the difficulty in determining whether the District of Columbia is a foreign power, a

That is what is going to happen. That is what is going to make it difficult for us to pass a budget in this body and pass it here.  I am going to talk about the reason I have to say that. I do not have to say it every time because I will continue to have the opportunity to do it every time. I just have to say it. It is a question of priorities.

I would like to bring up the two issues that I mentioned. We all have those in our hearts, and we will be happy to discuss them.  One of the issues that I mentioned is the President's trip to Asia this week, to the Philippines, and the first day he was there, as you know, was his first State of the Union Address, a day after the devastating earthquake in Japan. That has raised some concerns, I think, about the President's foreign policy.  In the last 2 weeks, we have had some very interesting debates on health care, on taxes, on education, on the deficit.

My friends on the other side of the aisle seem to have forgotten that when we passed the 1994 law that was called the JOBS Act, which created a number of provisions in JOBS Act to promote JOBS, Madam Speaker, that when we passed the bill, which the Republicans had no intention of ever coming to the floor of this House to vote on, it was a bill that was designed to encourage investment in the United States of America and to encourage American companies to invest in America.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6429, the STEM Jobs Act of 2007. This bill will increase the number of students graduating from college by up to 40 percent over the next 5 years by increasing student interest rates on Federal student loans and increasing universities and colleges' profits on Federal tax revenue gains from higher interest rates that rise to over 4 percent on student loans in the year 2012. Speaker Gingrich has said that he wants to cut the Federal student loan interest rate to 3.4 percent, but we should also be encouraging more students to pursue higher education. This bill will help to increase the number of students entering the workforce by at least 15 percent over the next 5 years.  The STEM Jobs Act is the next step in helping to increase the number of graduates from college by a minimum of 40 percent over the next 5 years

Well, we're going to have a debate on that on the floor.

I do not think it is fair to say it is a disaster in New Mexico. I think it is a very serious and important development in the area, and I think we need to deal with it. It is a landowner's concern.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Senate amendments to H.R. 4994, the Medicare prescription drug legislation currently under consideration in the Senate Medicare Committee. The Medicare legislation that we are considering today will provide funding for the prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries by increasing rates for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage.  I want to thank the committee chairman, Senator Harkin, and the ranking member, Senator Grassley, for working to include an increase in the Medicare Advantage rate in the final bill. This provision will enable Medicare beneficiaries to obtain the same prescription drug benefits that they would have received if they were enrolled in a traditional Medicare plan. I believe that this is a step in the right direction to allow seniors to obtain the prescription drug coverage that they are entitled to under Medicare.

I have said that we have the responsibility to look at the country and do something about the problems of health care. I am pleased that the administration has taken the position that it wants to slow the growth of the costs of health care. But we also have a responsibility to make sure that we give our kids and our grandchildren the same kind of opportunity that we have given our parents and grandparents.

So, in essence, we are losing the chance to get the job done.  I think the Speaker should do what the Speaker should do, and that is to go to the United Nations and demand that the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Secretary General of the United Nations, impose a freeze on the activities of the Cuban Government in the United States and the actions of the Cuban Government in Cuba.  There are those in the White House who want to say: Wait a minute. We will do nothing about this. I will do nothing about this. We will not even talk about this issue.

In fact, Mr. Speaker, the President's budget does Zika relief and homeland security funding.  Yet, in the House, we are ignoring the budget of the President's own party and refusing to pass a budget that will actually provide a new opportunity for middle class families to keep more of what they earn.  The American people want a plan that will lower taxes and lower the deficit, not another prescription for a new government takeover of health care.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

As a rising star in the Reds organization, Willie Mays was a force to be reckoned with. He was a true leader who made the Cincinnati Reds the world's greatest baseball team.  His remarkable accomplishments were not only what made the Reds the team to beat, they also paved the way for the creation of the modern-day American League.  In a game against the Cleveland Indians, Willie Mays homered off of Boston Red Sox pitcher David Wells. The next day, he was named the National League's Most Valuable Player, a role he has maintained throughout his career.  Willie Mays is a legend in baseball, and he deserves our respect and gratitude.

I believe it is important to note that the committee report includes the President's proposals to increase revenues by $11 billion over the next 7 years, which is $8 billion more than the committee report provides for deficit reduction. The administration proposal provides for $2.8 billion in additional tax relief to middle-class taxpayers. It is our view that these tax cuts are the best way to reduce the deficit.  This provision of the legislation provides for a 1-year extension of the corporate tax rate for a total of 8 years.  I am in support of the tax relief provided in the bill, but I have

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to an issue that is literally an epidemic in my State of New Mexico and people all over the country are paying attention to and talking about it in their congressional colleagues as well as in the media and other places. This is the list of food stamp recipients in my State who were recently identified as victims of human trafficking.  These people were targeted by unscrupulous people who lured them into paying thousands of dollars for sex, often with little or no warning. Most of these victims, as is the case with the problem I have been talking about for months, were able to avoid the ordeal by reporting the crime to law enforcement. Yet, as was the case with so many victims of human trafficking, there is still a need to address this issue.  I believe we must act now to help

I know that Ed has been very passionate about that, and he is going to be talking about it tonight, but this amendment that we are going to be talking about tonight is a sense of the Congress amendment.  The Constitution says that the Congress has the power to establish a balanced budget, and it says, ``For the last 30 years Congress has failed to achieve a balanced budget. It is the duty of Congress to enact legislation to achieve a balanced budget.''  Well, I think that, for those of us who live in the last 30 years, that means we've been living on borrowed time, because in the

Farmers and food processors have been begging us to act to reform the FDA for years, and we are finally acting.  This bill, the FDA Reform and Modernization Act, contains the very important provisions that are needed to help stop the Food and Drug Administration from expanding its operations. It establishes a public-private competition and oversight board to give the FDA the authority to deal with waste and fraud and abuse, and it ensures that the FDA has the resources it needs to deal with FDA drug approvals.  First, this legislation establishes a public-private competition. In 1992, Congress created a public-private competition to buy all of

Mr. Speaker, as many of you know, my first contact with Ireland came in the early 1960's when foreign Minister Peter O'Neill was visiting New York to visit the Speaker of the House, Howard Baker. We were able to work out an agreement with the Irish government to permit the two of us to go to Israel. It was my first trip there and I still remember that day vividly. It was a historic day for the United States and for Ireland.  I think it is appropriate to put this in the historical perspective of what has happened over the last 25 years.  I was a U.S. Senator in 1984 when the Soviets invaded Haiti. We were called upon to help the Haitian people, to help our own people, and to help our own people. In fact, we did help them. But as a result

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge support for my amendment to H.R. 4909, the National Highway System Reform Act of 1995 that would support the economic development of the Nation by improving the ability of industry to account for its activities.  This amendment would help States and local governments by encouraging the Federal Government to facilitate the use of Federal roads by encouraging the creation of new toll roads and highway corridors. It would also allow the Federal Government to use its inherent economic power to assist the States and local governments in promoting the transportation of goods and people.  My amendment would also require that States and local governments use their revenue generated from toll roads to provide necessary transportation facilities.  I am especially pleased that my amendment would require that the Federal Government provide at least 20 percent of the revenue for the new toll roads to be financed by the States and local governments.

Committee leadership has refused to give the VA a full accounting for the way it spends taxpayer dollars. The committee has been extremely unwilling to hold hearings on how the VA spends its money. Instead, the VA has been forced to rely on accounting gimmicks, using formulas that are arbitrary and far beyond the budget that Congress appropriates.  The Committee on Appropriations has reported the bill without any funding in the VA programs. The committee reported a bill that spends $1.5 billion more than the President's request. In addition, the committee has reported a bill that includes $5 billion in emergency spending. This $5 billion is not paid for. The money in this bill is coming from the largest, most successful employer in

There are very few countries that have a free market, and we have a government that comes in and controls the prices of drugs and they control the drug treatment. But the government of Colombia controls the heroin and they control the drug treatment. So I think we ought to control the drugs and the drug treatment, not the government.

We are not spending enough money to keep them trained and trained, and we are putting the cops in the neighborhood where they are needed. We are not doing enough with our border patrol, with our Customs and Border Patrol, with our Federal law enforcement.  This is a critical issue. It is the drug trade in this country. It is a system that is broken. It is an ineffective system. It is not working. I believe that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and I are trying to address that issue in the very same way

As I have said many times, there are many qualities in Attorney General Sessions that are very important to the American people. One is his experience. He has been a prosecutor, a judge, a U.S. attorney, a U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and then he was nominated to be Attorney General. He has been an attorney in private practice for many years. He is

The inspector general also said: Inspectors general of Customs and Border Protection have questioned whether agency officials at the highest levels have been candid and honest about the number of abuses at the border. The inspector general's report comes as the White House and DHS insist that DHS can complete the investigation it ordered, and it is time for the inspector general to take action.

In that legislation President Clinton and Congress took the first step toward Americans having the same education as the rest of the world.  The National Literacy Act is a good bill. It does a number of important things that will improve the quality of education in America. It improves the test scores of our young people, and it improves the education of our disadvantaged children.  Mr. President, it has been over 5 years since the passage of the National Literacy Act. Since that time, the number of children and adults with no basic literacy skills has grown from 2.5 million in 1992 to more than 5 million in 1994. The result is that the literacy of America's children is declining.  The number of children in the United States who have basic reading

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to introduce the Community Cancer Care Preservation Act, which will help to ensure that services to cancer patients are not cut short by price increases and drug shortages.  In recent years, Congress has debated the appropriate way to preserve cancer care, and some believe that the bill that is before us today would create a market-driven system to address the need for a cure. But this approach would lead to a single, fragmented system with little incentive for patients and providers to collaborate and to seek quality services.  Instead, the legislation I am introducing today will focus on the clinical care services patients need to survive and that can be delivered to them with the least cost. The bill focuses on those services that have a proven track record of providing long-term, comprehensive care, including a range of home and community-

As I said, this is the new slogan for the Democrat Party. They want to increase taxes on every American, not just on those who pay taxes, and to do that they are going to force all of us to use private health insurance plans that do not include abortion as a preventive health service.

The veterans that will benefit from the capital improvement are, first, the doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel who will be trained in the care of the sick and disabled. They will provide the care and training for the soldiers and the civilians who will have to come into the service, in the event that the veterans' service cannot be provided elsewhere.  The hospitalization of the sick and disabled will also be greatly enhanced. As the costs for medical services rise, the Department of Veterans Affairs will be required to reduce the staff and patient population to meet those needs.

I would just like to point out that we have worked together on a number of issues in the last Congress and the last 2 Congresses.

This subsidy was financed by an investment of $1 billion in subsidized Iranian oil by the U.S. Government, and the Bank says that this investment is good for the American economy.  The international sanctions imposed by the Congress have not worked. This administration has tried to do the opposite. It has tried to force Iran to stop its sponsorship of terrorism, and to abandon its nuclear ambitions.  Last week, the administration signed an agreement with the Bush administration to support a program to allow U.S. companies to invest in Iran.

genocide president today

Mr. President, today, I join with many of our colleagues in commemorating the 81st anniversary of President Kennedy's historic speech in which he called on the Nation to live out what he called the `` genocide of the human race today.'' I am pleased to join with Senator Dodd and other members of the Senate in introducing the United States-Peru Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation Act of 1994.  It is fitting that the year of President Kennedy's speech in the Salt Lake Temple on March 8, 1961, has come to mark the anniversary of his visit to our Nation's Capital. His visit highlighted the moral urgency of confronting the atrocities that have been committed in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras over the past four decades.  As a Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am particularly pleased to be joined by Senator Dodd, my good friend and

It is very clear that the outsourcing of the manufacturing jobs to China and other parts of the world is an issue that is really a crisis for the American people. It is not a crisis for this country. It is a crisis for the future of this country. It is not a crisis for the future of this country if we don't start looking at the issues and the reforms that are necessary to make sure that we do not leave this country the way we are.

Mr. Speaker, this has been a good debate on this bill over 2 days. Before I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary David Scott, I would like to say that this bill was introduced by the Republican majority leader Reid and the Democratic leader Pelosi in July and sent to the House for a vote by the House on July 23.  Mr. Scott said in the middle of July that Catherine and I had agreed that we would be offering a bill to address the crisis of child pornography on the Internet. The bill was introduced on July 24 and debated on July 27.  I am delighted that we were able to get this legislation on the floor today, because this legislation is necessary. The use of Internet pornography by minors is a very serious problem that threatens the future of our Nation and the freedoms we cherish.  We

It is an example of the kinds of bipartisan cooperation and compromise that are so essential to moving our country forward in a new era.  The chairman and the ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Simpson and Congressman Dicks, have worked hard on this bill. This is an issue that deserves the bipartisan support of all the members of the committee.  I want to especially thank

americans civil struggle 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to give my strong support of the Voting Rights Reauthorization Act of 2006 because Americans have a civil right to vote that we should all be able to come together to defend and fight for when they struggle against bigotry and discrimination. The Voting Rights Act has made great strides toward guaranteeing that every American has the right to vote, and it is only fitting that we should do everything we can to extend that right to every American.  While I am pleased that the Senate has taken action on this important piece of legislation, I am disappointed that some of my Republican colleagues have attempted to derail the reauthorization by undermining important protections for our voting rights. In particular, they have tried to prevent some States from using the Section 5 provisions of the law to protect the right of people of color to vote. In fact, the

And it's done great because of the tremendous investment by private companies.  But what we're seeing is what happens when it comes to jobs, and this bill that we're going to be voting on tonight says to the U.S. Department of Commerce, we're going to cut this agency by almost half.  Now, this agency does a lot of things, and it does a lot of things very well.

I do not think the Senator from West Virginia has been able to convince me of that, but I think he is correct that the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia is to ask the chairman of the committee to ask the Department of Defense to develop a way to say yes to the kind of report we want, to say yes to something that does not require the destruction of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile, to say yes to something that does not destroy the program that does not cause the United States to have a massive stockpile of nuclear weapons.

It will be to ensure that the funds are used to insure the quality of care for the Medicare beneficiaries. The current program provides an option for the Government to either use the funds or not to use the funds for the purchase of prescription drugs. I believe we have a strong support from the President for this approach, but I do not believe it is appropriate.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the opportunity to express my thoughts about the United States Union and the opportunity to talk about this subject that has so often been neglected.  When we talk about the United States Constitution, we are speaking about a very unique document. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton said that the first ``thing necessary for the existence of government is a free and enlightened people.'' The American Revolution and the U.S. Constitution were part of the United States Constitution. They created the greatest democracy on the face of the Earth.  I would like to remind the House that every single Member of this body, Democrat or Republican, I hope and believe that we can all look at the Constitution and say that this is a document that is the expression of our freedom, our opportunity to express ourselves, our views,

account raiding secretary 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, although I am a big fan of the Inspector General's Office, the current Secretary of the Interior is not in fact a `` accountant'' and does not live in the land he supposedly funds. Instead, the raiding of the OIG office is an example of an out-of-control bureaucracy that abuses taxpayers' hard-earned money and takes money from the Treasury without any input from Congress.  The Inspector General's Office, which I strongly believe should be funded at its authorized level, was established in 1975 to help protect the taxpayers' money. That is what it does, and that is why I support the Foglietta amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I think it is important to recognize the long and difficult path that we have taken over the last several years. At the time of the recession, the Fed, the Congress, and the administration all believed that a recovery was possible. In fact, the entire economy was in a bad shape, and yet the economy never recovered.  It was not until March of 2007 that we actually started to see some signs of recovery. The markets reacted positively to the idea that a small group of people, including the President, would actually be willing to step up to the plate and begin to try to pull the economy out of its tailspin.

workers chairman protections

Mr. Chairman, we all agree that bad actors who deny workers basic protections, including wage protections and working conditions are not workers and should not be hired as an executive vice chairman of a major corporation. But when we consider the serious problems of offshore oil and gas exploration, we must ask the question: Why is a company choosing to drill offshore when, in fact, their profits and stock prices are so buoyant?  When companies are making record profits, it's often only a matter of time before they decide to go into business offshore, knowing that the Federal Government and the American people will stand by and do nothing to help protect them from the inevitable economic fallout. The issue is simple. If you want to make money offshore, go to a different country. If you want to protect workers and American taxpayers from being shafted by corporate executives

It seems to me that, as we move into the debate on welfare reform, that it is really not about who is on welfare; it is about how are we going to pay for it. And the way to pay for it is by getting a handle on the cost of welfare.  I think it is interesting that we hear these arguments, as we are hearing them here today, about welfare being too expensive.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts) for yielding this time to me. Speaker Pelosi has made some very tough decisions today, and she stubbornly refused to even allow the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to have a hearing on the Chinese Communist Chinese Government. Chinese Communist Chinese Government Vietnamese Communist Chinese Communists. There is no room in this Congress for such blatant persecution of the human rights of the Chinese people.  Mr. Speaker, let me just say that in terms of the Chinese Communist Chinese Government, there is not a human rights abuser in the world today that is not a Communist Chinese Communist.  As a member of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, I would like to commend Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Skelton for their efforts to bring to light these disturbing violations of the rights of the Chinese people.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I strongly support this amendment to the Federal Workforce Restructuring and Related Agencies Act because it would take time away from Fort Knox and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  There is a real problem with the ability of the CDC to do the job of its mission. We need to make it much more difficult for them to deal with this outbreak of Ebola and other infectious diseases. The President has stated that he is prepared to accept this amendment and he will consider this bill in conference.  So I think this is a very sensible amendment. It has bipartisan support. I urge its adoption.

Madam Speaker, in the next few weeks Congress will be shaping and hopefully passing legislation to give the American people the tax relief they need to help them pay for their money bills and to help the economy move forward as it has been so well under Speaker Pelosi and her Republican colleagues in Congress.  Unfortunately, the current economic situation has brought out some important differences between Republicans and Democrats, but we have found common ground on one issue.  The American people want a Tax Code that is fair and that encourages growth and economic growth, but that is not what the Democrats have been offering to the American people for years. The American people have a higher standard of living and a better quality of life than the Democrats have. The American people want to see the middle class and the working class have more opportunities to succeed and to contribute to our economy and

The gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] and I will offer a proposal to allow the tax cut for the rich to go to people who have no income tax liability. That is what we will do. We will allow the tax cut for the rich to go to the rich.  Mr. Speaker, the $500 per child tax credit is

For the first time in years, the United States and Romania have imposed new economic sanctions against each other, not because they have much in common but because we have all worked out an uneasy truce that has no basis in the Dayton Accords.  Since 1991, the United States and Romania have both signed the Helsinki Final Act, which includes the requirement that the countries of Eastern Europe abide by the same human rights laws as the United States and the United Nations.

Madam Speaker, Americans awoke this morning to the heartbreaking news that unemployment has increased to 7 percent and that economic recovery efforts have slowed to a slow and heartbreaking pace. The economy has only been growing for the last 2 years but spending and tax policies have failed to keep up with the job creation and economic growth that has been required over the last speaker's tenure in the House.

Mr. President, some of you may know about the terrible tragedy that occurred near Glenwood Springs in West Virginia last Friday afternoon. One firefighter was killed and three others were injured in the attack on the elite law enforcement unit.  I was in West Virginia last Friday to join with many of my colleagues in a candlelight vigil for our fallen heroes. There were a number of extraordinary individuals from West Virginia, both Republican and Democrat, who were in attendance, including the former West Virginia attorney general, Tim Griffin. I was able to spend some time with the gentleman from West Virginia, and I can tell you that his loss will never be forgotten.  We have already spoken of the four men who were killed in the attack, but let me read a few more. A member of the West Virginia National Guard was killed when a piece of sh

Madam Speaker, America's confidence in our electoral system has suffered an egregious blow this cycle. Vote suppression and the cycle of destruction of our democracy has been a reality for far too long.  The fact that the Supreme Court granted dominion over the decisionmaking process to the Federal Election Commission is an outrage. Our elections are the foundation of our democracy, and it is imperative that we take steps to restore confidence in the electoral process.  I was in the well today with several of my colleagues from across the aisle, including the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mario Diaz-Balart), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost), and the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), and we were met with a thunderous and resounding roar of ``no'' from the people.

The provisions of the bill that would be repealed are a direct result of the inadequate funding provided in the conference report. The omnibus bill contains no revenue raisers or spending reductions in any major category. The conference report before us includes a $10 billion reduction in EPA's discretionary budget in the current fiscal year. This reduction is part of a series of decreases in EPA's spending that is intended to improve efficiency and the environmental performance of our Nation's Federal agencies.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Just 2 months ago, we were here with the time-sensitive threat of nuclear war, and we got off to a good start. We cut the number of nuclear warheads. We reduced the number of nuclear weapons by 20 percent.  We cut the amount of money that went to the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Agency, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and the Defense Science Board. We also made a good start in cutting the Department of Defense's nuclear weapons budget by 25 percent.  Now, the United States has not tested a nuclear weapon in the past 3 years. There is a threat to that.  So, Mr. Speaker, we have made a good start, and I hope that our friends in the Senate

Mr. Speaker, the Hyde amendment, which was passed by this House and signed by President Clinton, is a very simple, commonsense amendment that will bring about greater accountability for those who violate the law. This bill has a very straightforward purpose, and that is to correct a serious and growing problem, and that is the abuse of U.S. tax dollars overseas by corrupt and criminal individuals.  The need for this legislation is obvious. The IRS has had a series of scandals recently that have brought to the forefront the problem of corrupt and corrupting tax dollars.

One of the reasons is that we have a President who has spent a good deal of his time in the House and Senate trying to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB has been nothing but a rubberstamp for the biggest financial institutions, the big banks, who were able to have some of the biggest credit cards and all of the fancy loans and all of the big bonuses.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1549 and the ranking member of Transportation and Infrastructure for cosponsoring this important measure to recognize the life and contributions of our Nation's largest consumeers of crude oil and natural gas, the United States of America.  Mr. Speaker, as we know, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Edwards) is the chairman of the subcommittee. Both have led a remarkable and positive life, but they will always be remembered for their bipartisan commitment to the American people.  On February 13, 2009, as the Rules Committee began consideration of the Energy and Water appropriations bill, Mr. Frank introduced House Resolution 1549,

Madam Speaker, during the past 40 years, we have made tremendous progress in America technologically, socially and economically and has tremendous job growth in the last 40 years. I have to admit that the jobs have not come easily to this country. We are becoming a more competitive country.  We have the fastest growing middle class in the history of the world. We have the best education system in the history of the world. We have a world-class healthcare system. And we have done a lot in this last 40 years.  We need to make certain that we have the right priorities in our government. We need to do more.  The cuts to Medicare, the cuts to Medicaid, to education, to all these things are wrong. We have to do better.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman

opportunity protect radical 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I have some misgivings about this amendment because I think it is radical and it does not protect our good faith effort to take our opportunity.  I am going to support the amendment of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Young], but I would just point out that it is a technical change, and I think we need to be very careful in this area, because I do not think this is a perfect amendment, but I think it does do something to protect our good faith effort, and I think it is very, very important.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

committee spending funding 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, I come to the floor today to voice my opposition to Mr. Nussle's amendment to the spending bill funding the Committee on Labor and Human Resources' proposed rulemaking to require all public employees to purchase health insurance.  The amendment is shortsighted. It is based on the same old old scare tactics. The language in the underlying bill was passed in a bipartisan manner. That is why I am supporting the amendment. It is just as unnecessary and unnecessary as the language in the underlying bill, and it should be defeated.  As we know, President Bush has a veto pen and a veto pen that is far too long to satisfy any President. That is why he vetoed a number of similar legislation last year. But the President has shown he is willing to veto legislation that his administration disagrees with. That is why he vetoed the bipartisan
