If supply and demand is the major way to deal with speculation, I believe the way to deal with speculation is to remove that speculation from the market and to put money in the pockets of those who want to own real estate and to allow that to bring about lower prices. That way of doing it would bring down the price of homes and help bring down the price of people who own homes. I think that is the best way to do it, which is why I think it is so important for us to author our own legislation. I hope this body takes the lead in this area and brings the kind of legislation that will lower the price at the pump. I want to see what the price at the pump is going to be, what the value of homes are going to be.  The people that I represent in southern California,

Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues know, in Congress we are working on giving Americans an opportunity to vote on a new health care plan that will work better for them and will give Congress and the American people more control over their health care and their future and the ability to make better health care decisions for themselves and their families. I want to take a moment to give Members a break from the elections this week.  If you follow the health care debate, which I do, you have probably heard several phrases that have to do with ``this will kill the employer mandate.'' The problem with those phrases is that it's not true. It's not true that employer mandates kill the employer mandate. They just don't work that way. The key word is ``let the people choose.'' Employers have a tremendous incentive to pass health care mandates through

Mr. Chairman, I must rise in opposition to the amendment. I appreciate the gentleman's passion in his remarks but he has to put his own money where his mouth is and have fiscal responsibility when we are talking about other people in terms of their resources. I just would simply raise a point of order and point out that in fiscal year 1995 alone we increased funding for LIHEAP projects by $2 million.  If the Chairman is interested in additional funding, the gentleman could come and speak to me about that. But the thing about this funding is that we were adding $2 million because there is no doubt the LIHEAP program is at a very historic level. It is almost exceeded in terms of its efficiency. In terms of its cost to States, to my understanding in the first 12 years of the program it cost $39 million.

President Bush's administration put forth a foreign policy strategy which focused primarily on the continued terrorist threat that the world is facing at this very moment. This foreign policy is predicated on what I call ``global war on terrorism'' which includes efforts to coordinate a number of important U.S. foreign policy initiatives which are currently underway, including strengthening the people-to-people relationships in the region and maintaining a presence of U.S. forces abroad to protect the stability of the region.

Mr. President, today, most jobs require some kind of postsecondary credential, whether a certificate. an associate's degree is often more important than a degree from a high school, or even a State university. But after all of those credentials are completed they are a lot less secure than they were a few years ago and many Americans will get out of high school without ever having a postsecondary degree. We all want to have a good-paying job and at least some of us will have a higher income than we had just 10 years ago percent of Americans aged 20 to 64 would get a job in 2016 without a postsecondary degree.

In many instances, the grant program has worked well. In fact, in my home State of Virginia, the Eastern Shore District had an outstanding record of results that were aided by the COPS grant program.  Unfortunately, due to an amendment introduced to the Crime Bill of 1995 which affects other grant programs, my State will soon be without the COPS grant program.

Mr. Speaker, I was shocked to learn that Speaker Gingrich had suddenly dissolved the ethics task force on which he had been elected last night to look into his unethical activities in the 1990s. That committee had passed legislation that required a supermajority vote of House Members in order for Congress to adopt the president's foreign policy. Yet under the rule which dissolved the committee, Speaker Gingrich pulled that legislation out and brought in his former staff.
