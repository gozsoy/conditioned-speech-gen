Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the House rules and the House rules do not make it very clear where the commitment is that the President must keep if he is to keep the promises he made in Ohio.  First, of course, there was the promise that he made in Illinois. Now he said he would keep that promise and just write it into law. There is no clear commitment from this administration that if they cut unemployment insurance, that the clock will run.  You have the White House, including the vice president, that says they will keep their promise to boost the unemployment rate.  They said they would do nothing. Now, the unemployment in Illinois

Judge Shan passed away after a long illness on March 31, 2008. He was only the second judge of consent to be buried in Washington cemetery.

The amendment is to provide for a meeting between the State Department and farmers in each country to discuss the benefits to agriculture growers and to discuss the differences between the agriculture production systems in each country and the U.S. farm system. There have been many farmer meetings throughout our country, and all Americans benefit from agriculture when their crops produce a healthy, happy crop. In terms of farmers, they see that the corn and soybeans grown

The bill is $2.1 billion below the GOP House Budget Resolution and $3.3 billion below the veterans' consensus budget.  The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care programs without any consideration to increases for veterans' health care programs. The rule does allow one Republican amendment to be offered to bring up an amendment to restore funding for 5 years.  There is no voice vote in support of the Republican amendment. The VA/HUD bill is still lower than the House Budget Resolution by an amount that far exceeds that of the entire Republican budget that passed the House.

Mr. President, today President Clinton finally takes on the additional burden of actually balancing the budget by 1996 and every year thereafter. That is not impossible. But he has an election on the line to do it for the people of this country and for his own political advantage and the attention of the world.  The President asked Congress to pass a continuing resolution that will keep the government running while he and his Republican Party work out the details on what, if any, tax reform to enact. But the deficit is exploding and the trust fund, the Social Security trust fund, is at risk of running out of money. Last year, we ran a very tight budget

Mr. President, as we consider the budget resolution the Senate is considering today, it is important that we understand where we are on the Nation's priorities and why we need to pursue meaningful spending cuts that will protect Social Security and Medicare benefits and strengthen the economic safety net for our Nation's seniors. We must not ignore these implications.  We in this body have always understood the need to act on the deficit. After all, if we are to save Social Security and Medicare, we must find ways to pay for them. Unfortunately, the budget resolution contains an unacceptable proposal to cut the deficit from the amount that the Budget Committee projected last year to $616 billion

One of the most powerful and important voices in the fight for civil rights in California was Michael Milken, a respected and influential investor and private equity executive who became a unanimous star in the financial community and the issue of civil rights never fully allowed him to return to the Nation's stage without the consent of the people of California.  Years later, today I would like to take a moment to remember that peace dividend to the people of California.

As a Member of the Senate, I was one of the first to reach out to the families, who are the direct targets of the terrorism of that attack. In the immediate aftermath of that terrible event, we had a whole series of investigations which took

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  As you well know, I support the United States Government fully funding certain critical areas of research and development for land mines in the construction of new communities.  The recent construction of the new 16-hole national land mine tunnel, which continues to improve the safety of our airways, is certainly a positive step forward in improving the safety of our military housing. While I agree with the concept of providing funding for necessary technical improvements in this tunnel, the overriding objective of this bill is not only to improve the safety of the environment, but also for the civilian government itself.  Mr.

<|endoftext|>This is what it was like when the United States sent thousands of troops to the region of the Philippines in the early 1960s, and they were left to have to pay the people who were the victims of the war that they had helped pay for the war and that they had been members of the military government. When we started this country, at the time, there were no Filipinos living there anymore, so why are you sending a lot of troops there anymore? braineralki wai ting.  We must cut back in terms of sending troops to these military countries that we create here at home. In our hemisphere, in our

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the support of the State of the Union and the Finance Committee. I also want to thank the chairman and ranking member for continuing to work on the issues we are very concerned about and that we want to work on here on the floor of the House to make sure this fair budgeting process goes forward. I want to thank both of them for their continued involvement in this process as we are debating the President's budget proposal on February 2.  So I thank both of them for doing a great job on the Government Operations Subcommittee as they work to help the folks back home. I also want to thank the gentleman from

Madam Speaker, as Speaker John Boehner attempted to put the Congress back on its feet this week to serve the people that sent us here to serve them and help them get the Federal budget right, the Democratic leadership put forward a plan to strip the President of a budget resolution that sends to the States of more than $300 billion in cuts to education, health care, and other critical programs. I am sorry Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Speaker Pelosi Madame Speaker, but the majority is not making education and health care programs a priority for the rest of us. Instead, Democrats plan to cut education funding to the bone, cut investments in education

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and her passion for working on behalf of young people and working on behalf of the people that we talk about as Democrats and Republicans when we talk about what is best for America and what is best for our children and friendates and how we will work together and be honest and bipartisan when we work together.

Mr. Chairman, as I said before, we do want to make sure we do not get this to the States when the time comes when we need to come to a meaningful understanding of how we do our health care and how we protect those Americans who have the opportunity to pay for it, who are going to keep that option for themselves.  I would also like to thank my friend from Ohio (Mr. Traficant), the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for his help in bringing this bill to the floor. I also want to thank both our staffs and our ranking members on our Veterans' Affairs Committee. I think

Mr. Speaker, I will not take time to defend the Speaker's decision to move on a bill this week and I will instead go on record to say that the President should have an opportunity to come in and raise this issue and to have a vote on it September 29 after September 28 may be December 29 April 30 August 26 September 29 November 18 December 26 Last Friday, we had a law that was passed on September 27, 2003. It said this could only take place during a committee hearing on, quote, ``The substance of the bill.''  Does the House Speaker think that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Walker) was stymied in that

Madam President, the bill before the Senate would reauthorize the National Endowment for the Arts for the next fiscal year and fund it through the year 2005 in the committee-reported level of $19 billion for arts education, youth programs, and general administration. It would also direct $1.3 billion for director's offices and administrative expenses. I believe this allocation reflects the bipartisan consensus that supports a strong national program and supports the arts in all forms. I would like to ask my colleague to correct me if I am incorrect about these provisions.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>
