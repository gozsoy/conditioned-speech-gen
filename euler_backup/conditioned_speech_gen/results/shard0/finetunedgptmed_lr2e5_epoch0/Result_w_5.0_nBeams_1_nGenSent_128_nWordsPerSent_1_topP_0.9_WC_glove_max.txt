Unfortunately, we are debating something here that is so toxic and so useless that we are letting the administration spend the next 10 months just issuing a permit to drill off the coast of Louisiana for a company that was found to be using ships full of toxic waste in the gulf.  It is sort of like that Richard Nixon quote that you see time and time again in political campaigns. There are all kinds of little jokes about how we have the ability to tell

As we work to reduce these costs of compliance, this provision has become necessary to protect this program and ensure that employers are not negatively affected by U.S. law as it relates to the final costs of implementing our farm trade agreement with Canada.

Mr. Speaker, last week Republicans held a conference call to speak about their health care reform plan. There was a suggestion that the health care reform plan is about health care reform. While that may be true, the reality is it is about other ideas in health care reform and about health care for the working people of America, not the health care reform plan for the big tax cuts.  Mr. Speaker, the Republican plan would lower taxes for nearly 30 million families by over $1 trillion over the next 10 years and make health care even more affordable by ending tax credits that have helped health insurance premiums rise at a rate not seen since the 1950s.

It happened so well. My wife has now had two children. One of them will be her last. I have a third son with her to raise. We were very fortunate to have those two children on our side of the aisle. So I do not think we have to hold it against them to say we did have to do it this way. We did and we did it the way it was supposed to be done. That is where we

In 1990, when the President cut the food stamp program by nearly $6 billion, it was estimated that the Federal Government would have to take in $11 billion in welfare benefits to meet the new eligibility criteria--a ``deadbeat'' program, the American people came to believe. As Senator Harkin has made clear, the alternative in the

Mr. President, the Senator is certainly correct in the Federal judgeship order that the Senate has now adopted with the House with respect to Judge Roberts in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The order provides that if the Senate does not pass a Senate-passed resolution appointing Judge Roberts as a Federal judge on January 31, the President must immediately appoint a nominee to that court to fill the vacancy created by the Supreme Court's June 9 death. That was the Senate's unanimous-consent agreement last December.   3968 So, I say to the Senator, we ought not pass this resolution, unless we want to enforce a statute

Mr. Speaker, today, the House will debate the bill that has been proposed to reform a rule we passed last week in a vote of 183-195.  The rule allows us to bring up the first appropriations measure of the fiscal year 2007 Congress. But it also means that the House will not be able to vote on any legislative proposals until the budget is passed by the Senate and President Clinton is sworn in as President of the United States.  I say ``must'' because we have other important legislative proposals that will be on the floor of the House in the next few weeks, and we have many other priorities in our first 100 days.  But

It is a violation of United States law to refuse to recognize Iran's right to an ongoing nuclear program. The President is in violation of that law by denying the world this historic opportunity to increase pressure on Iran to accept its obligations to restructure its military program. This treaty--the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action--has only led to increased conflict. The world must take decisive action to advance the good will and resolve this dispute. Iran is no longer the country of oil. The regime may turn to oil but it will not

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the President's budget proposal to reform the Nation's Tax Code and provide tax relief for Americans across the country.  The Budget Conference Report would dramatically increase the tax burden on middle-class and lower-income Americans by reducing the child tax credit by $20 billion and reducing tax benefits for families earning up to $75,000 a year. The reconciliation process allows lower-income Americans to receive full value of the tax cuts in this legislation as compared to the last Congress.  This legislation cuts taxes on the most fortunate Americans by over $8.5 billion from the current budget proposal and the Bush

So I want to respond to the Senator from Kentucky.  The CBO report does not say that, as we know now, which is essentially what we did.

Mr. Chairman, this bill is not about saving one penny for the taxpayers. It is about saving America money, and the money that we are going to save the taxpayers here is not going to be coming from taxes, it is going to be coming from interest and the skyrocketing corporate interest rate that is going to come with this bill. This bill makes for a $60 billion tax increase and that is the only thing that is going to save the taxpayers. This bill just allows the rich to continue to put more money in the hands of the people.  Now, we have an issue here that I do not think even you on the Committee on

Mr. President, the House bill would provide Federal grants and loans to states that establish new funding institutions for environmental protection purposes.

The House bill would repeal the amendment that the House bill requires for funding that would bring the EPA to the proposed treatment or change the current treatment process.  We have many amendments pending from the two parties. We have to go to conference on all of them before the Senate could vote on them.

We may have had concerns about the last 10 weeks that some of us raised that we wanted to see a substantial cut of this, and we do want to see that cut to $700 million but we also want to get this back up to $400 million. This may be a combination of the two. We want to make sure that we cut $300 million from this bill for foreign assistance for the poorest countries and from projects in the best countries. This may be the level of spending that we will get back to in the coming weeks, but

Mr. President, this is an amendment that has been agreed to and has been cleared by the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Ohio. It is an amendment that has already been put on the calendar by the administration on a one-year basis and now that has been taken up and enacted into law. It is a very simple amendment which would provide for the Secretary of Defense to work with the Chief of Staff of the Army to provide for the orderly development of the Army Modernization Program and the Army Reserve Modernization Program so that we can bring them into the 21st century, so that they can be at the ready for war when it comes time.

And they are right to be right. The people who are working very hard on their taxes who are the least fortunate have been left out. They have been left out of the huge relief that

One of the things I learned working on the minority is we have different perspectives. We come from different business interests, and we have different views on how to get our jobs done. But the other thing I learn working on the minority is that we don't agree on everything so it is very important that we all work together. So if the government shutdown is about the shutdown of government, if this is about not having a Democratic Speaker to negotiate with Democrats, then I think it

There are a number of other ideas that have been brought up in the course of this debate about where we would be in the world if we do not address the war in Iraq. There are many other things that we could have looked at in this country.  Let me just briefly indicate what this is about and what the

Mr. Speaker, this week the House Government Operations Subcommittee held a hearing on the need for Congress to address the issue of cost shifting in health care payments in the Medicare Part D drug benefit. The result of the hearing was an open rule for consideration of the underlying Medicare bill which would provide for the administration to report its study of the cost shifting of the Part D drug benefit. But this rule does not include the Medicare bill.  A very good goal of keeping cost shifting to a minimum is for Congress to pass legislation which would allow Medicare reimbursement rates to increase at an additional rate based on patient cost growth in this program. That's a goal which makes sense

When Congress and the Federal Government spend too much money, they cause health care spending to go up because it is not only unnecessary but often a threat to the health of individuals and the family. Congress and the Federal Government have added in the last 30 years or so an average of 18.4 percent of the health care costs in America to the private sector. This means that people at the very bottom of the income ladder and people who have no other economic security are likely to pay
