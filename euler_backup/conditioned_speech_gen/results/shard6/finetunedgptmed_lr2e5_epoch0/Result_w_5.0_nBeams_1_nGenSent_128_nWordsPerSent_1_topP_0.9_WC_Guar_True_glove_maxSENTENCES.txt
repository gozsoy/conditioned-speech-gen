But that was out of committee. He came back and he voted against it this year. The gentleman is very clear on this issue.

This money does not belong to the Federal Government to do anything to help reduce poverty or eliminate the tragedy of Iraq, nor does it belong to the Federal Government to put children to work and give them the food, housing, clothing, health care they need to compete and build the opportunities they deserve.  Nowhere is that kind of largesse more evident than in the student loan program.  That is not a hidden side benefit of the $816 billion in tax breaks

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the results of the President's health care proposal. The program is nearly 40 percent bigger and covers people who do not have insurance but have grown up in families who have paid a family premium as a result of a job or small-business minority status.  The President's plan is a good deal better than what we have before us. Our plan would cover almost 7 million people. But, instead of focusing on the direct benefit to the poor, the President's plan has incentives for those who have paid premiums or have become uninsured. We have incentives for the ``uninsured.'' This is unfair to people who have

It is hard to see any political consequence to that. I want to stress the difference between Senator McCain and President Bush on that issue and the real political consequences of a decision to go forward with force in Haiti with a United States guarantee.

In a very specific provision of the Health Care Improvement and Modernization Act that was passed just 2 days ago, this provision specifically said that the hospital purchaser must take into account the part B prescription drug benefit costs. This is not part of the two GOP health care plans that were just passed out of the Senate, but I think it's an important provision that Congress is working on.

Further clarification of this issue would undoubtedly cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  I also want to stress the exclusionary rule provisions contained in the bill. If the Department of Energy would not appropriate this funding, the Treasury Department could step in and take the program, without the Department of Energy having a right to the funds. I do not think that is wise. I believe we should consider allowing the Secretary of Energy to independently receive these funds, if he feels it necessary, and

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill because it would provide free medical care for private insurance companies to provide for abortion and to offer one insurance policy for that cost to all taxpayers who would not buy it if the Federal Government refused to pay for it if it should ever become available to them if they requested it under that Federal mandate.  If Members accept this amendment to reduce the number of abortions to be taken by this bill they should withdraw their withdrawn support.

Tax cuts would help the middle class and lower taxes for the very rich to pay for the welfare bill that is on the President's desk today. The National Journal reported that the Advisory Council on Taxation found in their own 2002 annual report that the Republican alternative budget represents more deficit reduction than the Democrats' balanced budget plan.

The goal is good for America, and it is certainly very important to take care of the work force in America, but if we are going to take care of them, we need to help them and make sure that they get decent-paying jobs, we need to get decent paychecks, that they don't

<|endoftext|>Man it was great to see my former President John Kennedy this morning talking about the war in Iraq with respect to the needs of the American people and how it was so critical that the American people understand the history behind what happened to the Iraqis when we invaded that country in the first place and so many of the very pictures and videos that are coming out about what actually happened over those 2 years unanimous consent was not able to get that to come to this floor and print here in the Congressional Record. So thank you, Senator Kennedy, for that.  One of my favorite friends, just a couple of weeks ago when he was here, got up

Mr. Chairman, I think we are in a position to take the 1 hour in which we are able to do that because in many cases States have a long time that they are trying to deal with this issue and all kinds of laws that have been put in place in many cases have criminal penalties imposed upon those individuals who get them into the private sector and that they must pay those penalties and they have to have to take them up to the governments on a per capita basis and then deal with lawsuits which are pending in court.  In many instances, as Mr. Costello so eloquently articulated, we have the ability to increase the number of States in

Mr. Speaker, yesterday was the 10-year anniversary of the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. The Office of National AIDS Policy has estimated that there are more than 20 million Americans living with HIV/AIDS in our country and the number is increasing every day. It is time to grant every American the right to prevent a lifetime of pain and keep that person from going down the path that might limit their dignity and their potential for creating a better life for themselves.  Since the enactment of VAWA, we have made significant progress and achieved some great things. We have shortened the number of individuals denied the right to health care, the number of those

Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the ranking member of the Federal Financial Management Reform Commission for the fine job he did last year on this legislation and for the fact that we have actually increased the financial support that Americans need in this area of our economy and we have put it in the already vast Federal accounts for education and so on that go almost $10 billion per year to those 25 percent of the families that are uninsured.  So I think all we are saying is that we want to make sure that our tax dollars are being spent in the very best ways, the American way.  I know that Members will be asking a lot of

Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch for his efforts to work out a settlement of these problems and Senator Snowe and the Senator from Massachusetts and Senator Kennedy who are at the table and work very well together in the area of the studies on this legislation. Senator Byrd has an amendment that we hope would come up soon as well. But we hope we have the chance to have a full debate on the resolution of the appropriation bills and make sure that we follow through with the funding that is included in the bill and in each appropriations bill for the current fiscal year.  So I thank all of my colleagues. We have had to work hard in conference to accommodate

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this resolution that encourages our international partners to respond to the concerns expressed by President Trump in his call for democracy reform in the current democratic process. We know that there is great concern about corruption and rights abuses that go on in this country with the pointing fingers of blame or the actions taken at some point by governments.  Having been in office since January 2009, we know from that experience that we must face those challenges head on. We have seen the results of it over and over again in Afghanistan and Iraq. In that current conflict, the

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan legislation that would raise the minimum wage in every year of the life of this Constitution for any service that a Member has done while in this Congress. The Committee on Rules could not have done this without the interest of our fellow Republicans in the minimum wage law and in their friends and colleagues from the other side of the aisle who have been on the minimum wage rate since the Nixon administration.  The country as we know it today does not exist unless there is a support system in place for a large part of the work force in a job that makes a lot of money. It is a miracle that we have

Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to yield up to 15 seconds to the chairman of the committee.

Mr. Chairman, the term ``terrorism'' is used here today for anything other than an objective basis for the Government to provide services to a governmental entity if the services exceed $1 billion a year and involve one of the services in the telecommunications services commerce. That means that services for communications under the water channel, under the air channel, under the highway channel, under the high-speed roadway, under electricity, under wireless services, under voice telecommunications service, as well as services provided in the military, any of these are of a security concern and a total intelligence-gathering necessity.  The fact is that terrorism is a subjective fact of life for almost

Mr. President, I will be very brief. I will give some time to the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee and to the distinguished majority leader. I will be brief and will be followed by other Members of the body who have service to the Senate. I hope the distinguished Republican leader will come down. I can guarantee it is going to be very brief. I think Sergeant Scalise and Senator Kennedy will be present with Senator Conrad and other Senators in the morning when the III hour of morning business is brought forward to complete debate on the omnibus bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, we may not be talking about Federal student loans right now but it is a very important issue and it is a very serious one as far as the State of the Union and that we are doing what we need to do. If we take action in this area of debt-based education reform and ensure that Federal aid is not diverted from public education--and they have the authority to do it--for example, we would save $74 billion that would be diverted into State school lunch, recreation Montana Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek Creek butte
