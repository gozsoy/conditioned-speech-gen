Mr. Speaker, this is an opportunity for all of us to come together to come up with some meaningful legislation to address the needs of families, businesses, and government that have struggled over the last few years with economic downturns that have cost jobs and our economy in this country a lot of money.  We are in a budget crisis because we have not come up with a good solution to that crisis, and we are failing to address the needs of workers and families and to get them off the back of the workman and actually into the middle class so that they can create jobs for themselves and the country that will be too small for us to continue to

The idea is to try to guarantee that we are going to spend a certain amount of money--a certain amount of money--on these things for the public schools. That does not seem so evil, does it? But you have this program, and you only pay for it if you cover the cost.  My colleague, the Senator from Arizona, and I have been arguing for these 13 percent to be increased from now on.

Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Black Friday Massacre. In these difficult economic times, it is our duty to take steps to relieve the suffering of the American people and to make them a little better off.  This Saturday will mark the 31st anniversary of the tragic Black Friday Massacre in northern North Carolina when several hundred people were slaughtered on Black Friday in 1984 when their home was not theirs to own. After six days of looting and arson they finally succeeded in breaking into the home and turning it into a safe haven for hundreds of people who had been stopped on the highway during their peaceful efforts to get back to their homes

As we all know, it has been more than a year since the Senate passed and President Bush signed the Iraq bill and is now taking important steps towards the success of the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, the President still has not yet promised he will not call the war in Iraq over and we have not reached some critical milestone in the success of the war yet. If the President has been satisfied with the progress the Congress has made in several areas of the war in Iraq since the failure of the first Iraq resolution, why should Americans not be as well satisfied

Madam President, I believe we ought to be very careful what we are doing to the environment. This bill is really just more of the same. The President's decisions about that have been all over the map. They have been made on environmental grounds in New Mexico and California and the Interior of our country.  As a result of the Bush administration policies, even in the Pacific Northwest we have found that there are very many cases where high rates of landfills are continuing to occur in our country. What we are saying here is we have got to be more responsible in our use of those resources and the use of those dollars and the facilities and the

Mr. President, on September 9 of this year I wrote President Clinton for the second time in a letter which expressed grave concern about the President's request to abolish the Bureau of Reclamation.  The gentleman from California [Mr. Brown] asked for my views on this, and I wrote to him a short time later asking him what he thought of this request for removal from office of a public official charged with a public purpose. He responded by saying ``While I am disappointed that you have failed to honor the President's request to replace one appointed Secretary of the Interior with one appointed by a Republican Governor and appointed by a Republican President, I believe the need

It is not the Republicans that say: Vote for my plan or you will lose your health care plan. It is the Federal Government that says: Vote for my plan or you will not be able to keep it.  This is the question of the Republican majority and the people in this Chamber today and what they want to happen and why. And they will do it because they have a mandate to do it for their party and for their President.

Mr. President, I will vote to lift the sanctions against Russia and to give President Putin the right to veto any arms control agreement that he sees as necessary or should be approved before the end of the year. These measures alone would be significant steps forward. As our allies in Europe observe the fourth anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall, I am heartened by the prospect that we can restore the credibility of our own NATO allies and a once-outdated arms control treaty once again.  In my own judgment, however, the Russian policy toward its neighbors is misguided and wrongheaded. That is the view of a large number of Russia watchers.

The report provides many important recommendations and, in many cases, directly contradicts the administration's other recommendations in the program recommendations. These recommendations would cut costs, but only if they are ultimately paid for.

Mr. President, I have been fortunate to work with many of my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle to try to be as fiscally responsible as we possibly can in the time we are left. We have tried to be very prudent with Federal spending in this bill. The fact that we are at a record level in Federal spending is good news for me and President Obama and for all of the people in this great country because we want to do the right thing. We are not all perfect but we certainly are better than the last administration or we were last year. I would also like to say that we spent a little more money than the President

The longer this Government controls the health care system, the more we know about the science that is holding us back from taking greater action to stop the effects of health care addiction.

Congress cannot be expected to declare war on Iraq without congressional authorization, nor should Congress be forced to vote for invasion without a vote for withdrawal, because Congress has failed to take the action to support President Bush with funds that should have been directed to the troops in Iraq. The troops should have been sent to Iraq to end the terrorist aggression that has brought the Iraqi people to the brink

Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a moment to applaud the tax reform bill that has just passed this House and the great work that the committee has done to help bring the American people a tax cut that is less than the Senate proposal but more than the one the President had in the President's budget request. I can also say with the passage of the $500 tax credit for child care that the House may have a chance to have their tax relief vote on the floor of the House.  The House passed the reform package yesterday by an overwhelming majority and not to be outdone by the Senate that passed yesterday the child care tax credit provision by the

While the House Democrats hope to draft a much more cooperative Senate bill, the Republicans can turn their efforts to unravel the health care law and replace it with a care that does not protect the most vulnerable Americans with the highest costs, the most uncertain health care security and the worst possible coverage opportunities.  The most recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that Americans have some trust in the current

Private companies provide insurance to our Members of Congress who are eligible for Medicare, Medicaid and other benefits. Medicare and Medicaid are Federal programs that must cover these individuals. This bill provides States with flexibility to

Madam President, today I wish to recognize and honor the life of Justin Thomas who passed away from complications from a stroke at age 58.  While we all lost a truly great man and a dear friend who was a dedicated public servant and a pioneer in many aspects of the law, we also must also take great pride in his passing and wish him continued happiness in his retirement from the Senate.  Justin served as the State of Oregon's undersecretary of commerce for the past 18 years where he advocated for the interests of the Washington State Department of Labor and Federal employees across the State of Washington and in Oregon. He was also the state treasurer for

I appreciate so much his work on this matter as well as the bipartisan leadership on both sides of the aisle that led the effort.  Health care premiums in our country are already very expensive. That is why the health insurance market is so very different today than it was 10 years ago. And that is why premiums are already out of control for most Americans today and why if you
