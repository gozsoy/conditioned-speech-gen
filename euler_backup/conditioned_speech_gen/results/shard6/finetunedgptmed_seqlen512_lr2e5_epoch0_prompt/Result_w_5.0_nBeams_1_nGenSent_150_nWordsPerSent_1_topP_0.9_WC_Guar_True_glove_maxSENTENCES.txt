So do you get, my colleagues, the hypocrisy? They slashed the tax collectors, paid eight times the tax rate of private industry to cut the taxes, and cut the rate to cut the deficit by cutting spending. Is that not hypocrisy? The Republicans slashed the deficit; they cut spending. That is hypocrisy, Republicans.  That is what is so dangerous about a filibuster, Mr. President. It sounds innocent to the people around you.  Mr. President, I want to share an amendment which the other side has already offered which they will vote on in just a couple of moments.

Mr. President, the smoke is housing crisis foreclosures. The fire is the general economy because the money is coming out of the financial markets and failing financial institutions in order to finance the crisis at home with these mortgage loans. The recent failure to pass an emergency bill to stop foreclosure will continue to leave millions of American families and small business owners out of business for the year. President Bush announced this last week that he would declare a national emergency on the night of February 13, and Congress should have acted sooner. It is not just that we want to help small businesses, and there are many. We are deeply concerned that President Bush has used this bill to ram through the new Republican fiscal agenda.  Both my home State of Massachusetts and West Virginia have passed emergency declaration legislation with similar language. The Mayor of Boston's family was evicted and has

Mr. President, over the last many months millions of Americans have signed up for affordable health insurance plans that are so good for America that they are expected to pay not just the cost but the so-called cost of the benefit that the Government is giving them and their families so they can be given that choice of health care because that is true choice of health care. Those are often the most accurate descriptions of what these plans are for families so that Americans have confidence that they are going to have access to that health care if they are entitled to it and are stories that President Clinton spoke with and now those Senators are trying to bring to the floor. We have worked to bring to the Senate floor the recommendations that are still being considered by the administration which set forth ways to give States flexibility to establish their own universal insurance programs.

Mr. Speaker, the American public strongly favors banning gifts from lobbyists to Members of Congress, and the Supreme Court has recently confirmed the importance of that position. That opinion has also recently been strengthened by the Citizens United decision of the liberal members of the Supreme Court who only support actions that will benefit their position rather than the public interest in support of their positions. The reason the government is required to pass laws on lobbying is not to benefit the public but to ensure that the President has the ability to influence the political leadership.  If we are going to get our democracy back in balance, we need to create incentives for private citizens to give of their time and their money, not only for lobbying but for other endeavors. Lobbyists must not pay for campaigns but instead must live within their means. They must not waste their time lobbying their friends. They

Mr. Speaker, earlier this week the Senate passed the largest tax increase in American history and the largest Government spending increase in American history. We are only now beginning to fully understand the implications of that because of the fact that a number of states are sending their tax bills for the year's second quarter to the President.  First, I think we should take a look at the truth of what is going on here. It is not just about what Washington and the Democrats are proposing. This is really a measure that is not about cutting taxes for anybody, it is about cutting the Government.

I want to be very clear about that statement because no one was ever in favor of this program. And no one has been involved in its development nor has any merit for this program.  But let's say we're talking about an attack on public education.

Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Pence amendment as strongly as I can support the Democratic alternative, but I must oppose this bill as well because it is a Republican effort to cut the Title X funding that will result in the full funding level of Planned Parenthood for the first time in 5 years by 25 percent over what is currently provided. Now, they claim that because the opposition to this bill comes from the left, that their argument is, as always, that the left has no right to demand that cuts in their funding be made by Members of Congress in the first place.  Madam Chairman, this bill violates the intent of the Hyde amendment because it moves funds from women's health to abortion. Under this proposal, Title X would be eliminated, which has always been the case for Title X funding.  Madam Chairman

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly extraordinary young student from Connecticut. Jack Robinson of Carver High School in Norwich has raised more than $30,000 for the State of Connecticut through the dedicated and selfless spirit of his school spirit. His strong purpose and dedication is truly one of the most inspirational stories I have ever heard about young people in this country and throughout the world today. On September 24 in the building of the school in Norwich, Connecticut, a new child was born to a single mother and two young boys who are currently on the list of eligible First Selected in 2003. Jack shares his story with us in this image of his new son, Tay, at his graduation ceremony. While speaking, he said, ``Life will always have it's ups and downs. This is one of those time of ups and downs

Mr. Speaker, this is a must-pass bill. Many disabled veterans and their families depend on the work to provide healthcare to these families and veterans. The bill will finally allow people to have health care that is high quality and is affordable to them and their families for the Nation that they loved and so much of our country expects to be able to provide health care for our people and to provide quality health care for our people. And for some veterans and families, medicine will be needed and medical procedures will be necessary. For example, the VA Medical Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado, recently opened for the first time to treat veterans. There are four buildings on this campus with 300 beds. The facility was a total setback. In addition, the VA has actually put in almost $1 million in advances in computers and facilities to keep up with the needs

Mr. President, today, I again rise in support of the Comprehensive Child Protection Act. I want to begin by saying that this legislation is a positive step forward in efforts to help those children most at risk for abuse and neglect and to make responsible adult decisions for those children. Sex crimes and sexual violence make up a high percentage of the sex offender registration bill before us. Sex crimes--including child sex crimes--are very difficult to prosecute because the burden is often placed on parents to enforce those laws, place children's safety first and to turn over the results of their judgment to law enforcement in ways that will not deprive families or themselves of their rights. The sex offender registration bill requires States to report to the Secretary and the Attorney General on the number of convicted sex offenders in their State and what happens to those offenders. It would also require the Secretary

We have had a recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts, which said we have a $23 trillion cost in the future from this money going to our backyards, that we are going to be paying for when we pass this bill.

Congress has authority over several of the programs on this list in this bill and in previous appropriations bills. The committee has been unable to reach agreement to authorize additional funding, therefore I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to help provide additional protections for our veterans.  The Supreme Court ruled that SBA has the responsibility and authority to allow veterans to work in certain fields with full time employment.

Now some people will say no subsidies are paid to businesses which cut costs, and when those cuts are necessary--as was seen in the need to invest in our programs in manufacturing and agricultural manufacturing and provide stimulus so more people can work and save more money--we actually get a subsidy from taxpayers of the goods we buy so they can buy subsidies.

Mr. Speaker, after decades of Washington irresponsibility, Americans are facing nearly $17 trillion of debt and deficit and tax increases. Washington chose to put Government-run health care on a path to the bottom of the economic and fiscal mountain rather than increasing the minimum wage or making it more cost-effective to work as many Americans as possible on the Obama budget.  After balancing the budget, we must get serious about reforming Medicare and strengthening Social Security. President Obama's budget fails to address those problems.

Madam President, since coming to office, the President's National Security Council has experienced more turmoil and tension than in recent years, and its chairman, General David Petraeus, who has been Chief of Staff to President Obama since his election, has been being criticized for his actions in Iraq and even his political ambitions.  For nearly a year now, the President has conducted a shadow war in Iraq and has allowed that war to spin out of control. He has demanded that all relevant and credible officials in Iraq have to receive the highest security clearances they can possibly get and that U.S. troops be safe on U.S. soil, and the mission must continue.  The President's unwillingness to get results from the war on Iraq is proving devastating to our national security. Our troops who have fought in Iraq have lost a combatant who spent

The committee language in the committee report includes a provision to raise the allowable amount of Pell grants by 25 percent for students at colleges and universities.  The committee has always supported public colleges and universities, and they are providing a fair and equitable treatment to America's low-income students. Yet the Republican bill will pull Pell grants for low-income students from their Federal funding.  College affordability is an important issue for this country.

That would have to be cleared with the appropriate body in the House before it would take effect for the money to be used to carry out that result which required the increase of the State minimum wage. So that meant the increased minimum wage which the House here in the House did not adopt would not apply in scope to the rule that we made to consider the rule on the rule.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, I was going to address the underlying question here, but I know my colleague on the other side is intent on opposing it because the amendment which is before the Senate is that that bill which was the subject of the amendment he offered for which we are not seeking the time. So I do not see the need for the amendment that he is offering to the amendment which he seeks to oppose that law which, as Senator Kassebaum said, he himself will vote to kill.  I say to my friend from Maine that if he wanted to offer an amendment that passed, if he wanted to introduce a bill which he would kill if he was given the opportunity, I think he should get the chance to do that because that is the procedure that has been used by this Chamber, and the majority has refused to allow it, in

Let me finish this. Did that individual have that information given by the CIA? Was it used in the making of the decision to hold the air traffic controllers hostage in an effort to try to bring down the air traffic control tower on September 11 without authorization to the security committee or the administration? If so, the Government had the information and the classified information in that agency in the case of the American International Group. But the administration may have in the administration office a report that was not based on the information that the Council on Foreign Relations issued a few weeks before that, but it was to be spread throughout America, and then you found that the National Security Agency had this information in their files. They even spread it.  They went to the prosecutor's office in the United States and they asked him to subpoena the Defense Department, the U

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Employ Older Workers Week, a time to reflect on the changing ways our workers are making the daily decisions that shape our society. In a recent report on health care reform, the Health Care Cost Institute estimated that older workers would be paying $13 billion more to insurance companies in retirement benefits over the next 10 years--an average of about $41,500.  Families are spending more time and money on their health care and more of their money--over $250 billion a year--is going for health care for their children. The American people are paying this cost. They want us to do something about it. This week, we are honoring the millions of older workers who are willing to put their health care choices ahead of the needs of their children.  There is much work to be done

That bill proposed the protection of a significant number of public sector employees in public housing projects and public schools for which the funding was provided by the State or local government.

I have a few observations about this proposal. There is this myth that this budget is the sum total of something that has been achieved, which it is not.

Madam Speaker, yesterday Virginia District Court Judge Henry Hudson's decision striking down one provision of President Obama's health care law has provided a stark contrast to his new administration's plan to restore Americans to health insurance, the Affordable Care Act.  The President seeks to create a massive, sweeping government takeover of health care that will force everyone into either a Government-run health care system, or, more likely, into a private insurance company. In addition, he promises an exploding cost for a Government takeover.  Mr. President, how do you respond to such evidence that insurance companies, once again, are overcharging their customers? Who needs all that Government mandates when they can come up with a healthy alternative?  If the President wins, Virginia voters will have a new, state-run system. But if his victory is reversed, with another

Several of the issues cited by members of the committee concern the very facility programs which have proved so successful for decades and beyond.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment because I believe that American taxpayers should not be financing international abortions as if they were funding abortions for legitimate medical purposes. I think that this is a very important amendment because it basically requires us to determine what taxpayer dollars are being spent on abortions. For example, the money that this amendment requires us to find for abortions, for funding overseas abortions and the funding of people who are going to be living here on this continent for years and years if we continue this crop of birth control methods.  Mr. Chairman, it is not true that we are not being responsible. There are no abortions that are going on overseas under this legislation. For instance, in Uganda, a nearly 2-year-old girl is suffering a painful form of pregnancy, is at risk for dying. The Ugandan

I hope that we are able to work that out this week and then Senator Ensign and I will be able to come back and work in the first days of July and offer an appropriations bill for arts education, which will help the States and local schools get those funds.  I will speak again later this week when Senator Ensign and I are able to go to conference on this bipartisan agreement.  Senator Conrad and I are going to stay in touch over the next few days to see what will be needed and how we can accommodate the States in moving forward to fund this important education program.

Correct, this bill narrowly deals with flight crews only. The bill is a technical correction to an incorrect provision that was in the Air National Guard bill that I did not agree with because I did not want to continue to make my argument that there should not be a problem because no one will have any reason to make a mistake.   Narendra: There was one provision that had to be corrected, but I think that the broader issue there is to correct to make sure we can ensure that what we do is reasonable adjustment. So I think if I were to go further, we can say that every pilot will always receive an even more generous return than they would receive if they were held accountable for this error, in part because if they were to do it again, they are going to be held accountable for that error.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I support the continuing resolution because it will continue funding for key Government operations such as the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Institutes of Health. The action to continue funding for the Government is required in order to keep Congress and the Federal Government in act.  We must be careful not to burden taxpayers with more Government expense. Instead, we should just be acting in the best interests of all Americans, and that is why it is so important that Congress acts so that we can continue to fund essential Government functions.  There are two different types of continuing resolutions that have been passed in recent years. One would say that the continuing resolutions would require us to continue to fund important Government functions while the other would prevent the government

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, the people of Arizona are getting much more help this year because Congress passed legislation last week to limit the cost of illegal immigration to the taxpayer.  The Supreme Court had given Congress the authority to do that on the merits of the issue before us today. The question before us is whether it should be granted consideration on the issue of welfare reform. Since the Supreme Court refused to hear a case involving public assistance on the basis that it involved political affairs, and since the liberals in Congress gave away all authority to issue regulations on welfare reform, we are not going to hear the issue before us today about one Federal intervention on a national subject.  We could debate the merits of the issue of public assistance but not the merits of welfare reform. I say that because that issue

It provides a substantial increase in the amount of money we can put in the Federal cybersecurity fund and requires that DHS and the other departments and agencies that receive the funding put in place the best security and the most cost-effective programs for their own employees in the time available for them. It funds homeland security grants to make the case to private sector partners how they can improve the cybersecurity of their businesses. It creates a permanent 30-day time limit on the filing of information about cybersecurity incidents that Congress deems catastrophic. It requires the VA to spend 4 percent of its operating budget on cybersecurity and protect sensitive data to ensure that every veteran has access to the information they need to continue to serve the country.

You said it might be a better idea to let the States control it if it is the result of some sort of third-party decisionmaking so you get the best you can out of that so that you turn it over to your family when you go on your way so that you can listen to the decisions your parents make in terms of the health care and the benefits that they see for themselves.

And it is one thing if you object to the procedure because the procedure is deemed inappropriate and the dollar amount is significant. And it is a very difficult situation to resolve if one is trying to prevent the application of such something that may or may not be supported by peer review or review by a third party and that the approach taken in that area by the inspector general as we have had under the previous administration is acceptable.

The Times quotes General Petraeus as acknowledging ``longstanding ties between Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence'' and bin Laden terrorists. General Petraeus provided intelligence information in support of terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan prior to the attacks in Afghanistan and Afghanistan in Pakistan. Pakistan also provided Taliban troops with weapons. Bin Laden claimed credit for the attacks. The CIA has established a strong relationship with Pakistan since the Afghan war began.  Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan vote could have had the opposite effect. Bin Laden and his allies in al Qaeda were able to retain their legal access to the United States, even if they were designated terrorists under international law. This bipartisan decision would have created a dangerous precedent.

Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from North Carolina has made the case more eloquently than I will ever ever do in here, but I want to address two points on this bill and the bill that passed the House over the last Congress that is being considered by the House today. First of all it is absolutely essential that we have a regular order for the raising of the debt limit by the end of this week and for the road to a new era of debt and the road to the North American Union; and for that reason, the American people deserve a fact-based debate on what our priorities are in the fiscal year 1995 budget resolution. It is also important that we do not stay in line with what the President has planned. Last December the President came to Congress and basically said that spending cuts would be used as the only tools that we would

This legislation also reauthorizes the Scientific Research Program at the University of Florida and the Education and the Humanities Education and Research Center at the University of South Florida for two years. The President signed this bill into law last August as part of his push to eliminate budget cuts that had threatened to derail NASA's mission to explore the solar system and beyond. I am extremely proud of both programs and want to commend the President and the Members of Congress who worked hard on this bipartisan legislation.

I would be careful in making a judgment as to how much additional money this bill will cause to balance the budget.

Mr. President, in the early 1950s, at a time when political backrooms were still smoke-filled rooms and small-time crime was still a crime in many towns and cities in this country, a small group of Iowa men, mostly hardworking Americans, came up with the idea to start up a national organization for their support of President Richard Nixon. The Iowa National Interest Club was the first such national club in the United States to be started in early 1951. As it later evolved into the National Interest Club of Iowa and Iowa Social Security Committee, over time Iowa National Interest Clubs have broadened into national organizations for labor, seniors, students, veterans, environmental concerns, and public service.  The National Interest Clubs in Iowa represent groups like the Central Iowa Club, the Iowa Joint Council of Government, the Iowa Association of State Emergency Response Agencies, and

Mr. President, I am compelled once again to voice my grave concerns over the state of the Medicare system in my home State of Ohio and across the country and in particular to voice my concerns about the act which this body is about to vote on shortly regarding the passage of the budget resolution of the House of Representatives which passed yesterday with only one vote of opposition and the expression of opposition is it the majority party that is standing up and saying we want to go to conference and move on the debate and come up with a budget which Parliament can approve and get through the Congress.  The budget resolution that was agreed to earlier in the week was not agreed to by the Turkish Government and as a result, Turkey is not yet capable of governing. The bill passed by that body would have further aggravated the problem of Turkish unwillingness to accept our position regarding

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, tonight is the last time we are going to allow a paid company to make any tax relief available to their employees or any other employees to take care of the employees who have to pay for the health care of those who are already sick. We are going to have to say no to that now. And we have only one choice. We can either give hospitals a pay raise.  The hospital pay raise bill we are debating is going to increase the deficit by $33 billion this year. But every American cannot afford the increase in the cost of health care and medical care.  We know that Medicare is going broke. It is an actuarial report that says it is $122 billion in debt, and we ought to be paying our debt, not making it even worse

Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong opposition to this amendment. This amendment would increase the funding level for the Bureau of Interior. This amendment would allow over 60 percent of the funding to go to one entity. This would allow the Bureau of the Reclamation to purchase the properties of the Sago Valley casino in the Rio Grande Valley. This would make it possible for both major bidders to get involved in the Sago Valley.  Unfortunately, the bill before us removes two regulatory priorities that are mandated by law, and it continues our progress toward the goal of ``zero waste, no work.''  The bills before us today also prohibit the Bureau of the Reclamation from purchasing lands in the Sago Valley that could be open for any private activity. In fact, the bill today prohibits the Bureau of the Reclamation from

Madam Chair, the current regulatory structure is not lacking authority. The Federal Reserve and the Government Accountability Office both have noted that Congress has authority to limit risk and limit funding as a means to ensure that regulations are reviewed on the merits of legislation and as time goes on legislation amendment or debate.  However, Chairwoman Waters' amendment does two things that would drastically hamper those who continue to review Federal regulations. It would prohibit agencies from conducting reviews of regulations on any agency's own expense and, secondly, it will create an unlimited amount of additional review that would undermine the very purpose of rulemaking.  I am pleased to see that Ms. Waters is seeking to work with the Finance Committee to reform the regulatory process.

I thank the chairman, and I wanted to respond to some of the comments that have been made here with respect to the process that we have to go through to respond to these operations.  Let us go through some of the details of the 1998 loss of life from the BP oil well in the Gulf of Mexico to the 2010 oil and gas billion dollar oil and gas industry that has operated in the Gulf of Mexico for years. According to estimates by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration alone over 5 billion trillion cubic feet of oil spilled from the oil well system across the Gulf of Mexico, 6 billion barrels of oil and 2 billion barrels of natural gas have been released by it. This has cost the American taxpayer over $28 billion. In the Gulf of Mexico alone the disaster was responsible for between 600 and 700 deaths in May 2010,

They are going to leave it where it was because they are not talking about how much they are going to demand back or the income of the person who is going to be the lead fund to pay this back or how much they are going to cost and the higher points of treatment, and how much they are going to get and how much of the income should be provided to an independent source.

That is what we did with Presidents Reagan and Bush. They would veto the bills, if you wanted to have any policy change. They would veto any bill that would provide direct spending authority and any executive action that would change the law.  So when Reagan vetoed the 2001 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the famous teachers bill, what did he do? He vetoed the money that was requested by the Senate. We are still waiting to get the money that was not allocated and sent to the President in the form of tax increases.

Wyoming, Alaska, and Arizona are a handful of States, but they are a majority of the Federal Government.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bipartisan amendment, which would benefit counties all across the West of Colorado that would be able to receive funding from this legislation for land acquisition for flood control projects.  The amendment, which would provide $5 million to each of Colorado and Federal funds for low income families and low income homeowners payments through FEMA for a national flood insurance program, would establish a Congressional Accountability Act bipartisan leadership fund so that Congress would not end up relying on the Republican congressional leadership to restore funding for our disaster relief program.  One of the most critical aspects of this legislation, Mr. Chairman, is that it would require consideration of proposals from the county level, the Federal Government, and the State of Colorado for flood mitigation projects and compensation for homeowners in California and in my home State of Colorado. This is a good step

Mr. President, for over 3 years, genocide has been the order of the day in Burma, and in doing so it has not only killed millions of people but has forced the people of the country to face genocide itself, rather than a hostile government or a rogue criminal organization.  In the years since the signing of the bilateral Peace Agreement in 1993, efforts to strengthen the government have been thwarted by efforts to instigate ethnic and religious violence.  The Government of Burma has used ethnic and religious violence as an excuse to silence and intimidate minorities. It has ignored basic human rights provisions designed to guarantee due process of law, fair trial, and the protection of human rights.  U.S. assistance to Burma since the signing of the Special Relationship agreement has helped to promote democracy and economic progress. It has undermined a government that has not honored

I think it is important to continue on this side of the aisle on the issue of restoring respect for the rights of citizens of the United States to go to the polls and to vote. For many years, this country has been all too slow in increasing our spending on elections.  We have not gone as far as we should have in the past because we have not lived up to our responsibilities to make our public services good for our constituents, good for the taxpayers. But I think we need to reaffirm our commitment to doing that, but also at this moment in time reaffirm our appreciation for those people who do go to the polls, who work hard, who travel thousands of miles, who know it is their right to vote

My Republican colleagues are ignoring the word ``fraternity'' and belittling Iraq's ability to succeed if it does not tell the truth and be transparent.

If we are able to provide security of supply and other services to people who need them most at a time when they have been on the Medicaid rolls for so many years and do not have the other benefits that they have been entitled to with their memberships, we have got a chance to be helping these people.

Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker, last week Democrats in Congress worked with Republicans in Congress to improve our economy by working together to raise unemployment benefits and increase the standard of living for the working families of our country. Unfortunately we cannot allow our good work to be forgotten because House Republicans refuse to work with our friends in the other body to make job creation happen.  Mr. Speaker, we are moving to give Congress another week to bring jobs back to this country and we are doing it right now by eliminating the loophole that allows the previous administration to cut taxes for the wealthy while still retaining tax rates for middle-income earners.  I rise today in strong opposition to the tax cut bill that Republicans have passed. It doesn't reduce the deficit; it doesn't deliver real benefits for our hard-working people

Last year, the Congress passed the Improving Veterans Health Care Facilities Improvement Act of 2003 to address long-term care needs for our veterans. This legislation includes a number of reforms that provide for more mobility for veterans and easier access to care. Our reform of VA health care facilities will ensure access to care for our veterans in a timely manner.  When Congress first enacted the Improving Veterans Health Care Facilities Improvement Act in 2004, it was clear to me that the improvements needed to address long-term care needs were long overdue. I was deeply concerned that VA

The World Trade Organization is such a critical antitrust, labor, and regulatory forum that we should fully include it in the authorization bill, not against it, in such a manner that that place does not need to be burdened by it.  It is very obvious to anyone who has any knowledge of antitrust law and the antitrust laws of this country that the true cost of the WTO is enormous, it is an enormous burden on labor, on employers and on businesses.

Madam President, I will briefly summarize this amendment, but I first want to thank the ranking member of the Finance Committee and his staff for their patience and the cooperation with me on this amendment. Let me describe what I would like to do with this amendment to the Finance Reform Act of 1997 to reform the mortgage agreement program to make it more acceptable to lenders to enter into agreements agreeing not to foreclose on certain property and terms of the mortgage when that property is in bankruptcy or foreclosure. This amendment would allow loans that would be entered into for the adoption of certain homeowners to be out of title so that title to such property would be available for purchase with the proceeds of such home in the event of bankruptcy.

That's right. Absolutely. And it's equally important to recognize that this is not a big tax cut for the wealthy. It's not a big tax cut for the small businesses or even the corporations that need it the most because they make a tax burden on the government that they cannot pay that would allow that plan to work.  But what it really does is take money from the people and invest it in these things that are really best for their future generations so they can have a better chance to be able to provide more for those very same children and their equally-great-grandchildren.  And I think the person that really understands the most about that, you know, there are 70 million people that are going to be living in the United States of America for the next 100 years, this is not a small tax cut.

He has been a leader on this issue for the last 15 years. And it is important to say that in the efforts of the Finance Committee to deal with these questions, there was not a Senator in this Chamber who would not vote for his work.

For many years in Washington State it was the largest mining and industry organization in the Nation which has lost a major organization to the first session of Congress. Winfield L. Winfield was a successful businessman who over the last half century put a victory spin on his good fortune by creating and leading several different business empires. Winfield L. Winfield was born in this city in 1950 and passed away this week. He started his first business while he was still in high school and set up Winfield L. Winfield Inc. and started it in 1976, a trade paper company where he wanted to create jobs and to help the textile industry in the community. He began to innovate and be entrepreneurial. He began to build bridges

Madam Speaker, America's intervention in Libya was initially based on the international community's ``Responsibility to Protect'' doctrine, which is a non-binding international agreement which would have required the United Nations to establish a no-fly zone that would have allowed Libya to be recognized to be part of NATO and to have agreed to cooperate in the destruction of its weapons of mass destruction.  Instead, the Libyan rebels took advantage of the United Nations agreement and fired on the United States commandos. Fortunately, three of our pilots were killed.  According to the most recent report from the Congressional Budget Office, the so-called ``humanitarian'' mission of this U.N. inspection mission will cost $1.1 billion. And, the American taxpayers are losing $5.5 million.  Madam Speaker, it is time for the administration to stop

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Sean Duffy, as the longest-serving individual in this body today and as the person who has seen these issues that people need this legislation that is in this bill that has been so important to us on many of these issues and we are moving forward on that bill with both those as well as the provisions for our veterans who have served this country so well that millions of them in this country, probably a greater number than any other group in this country would not be here without the act of Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Engel and our colleagues on the committee.

I yield myself 15 seconds, Madam Speaker, just to say as I had said to my friend from Missouri and my friend from Texas earlier today that Republicans do not want to raise taxes on people in this country or on companies in this country and that we have no intention of increasing insurance premiums for people that are covered by their insurance and people who are covered by their health care plan in this country that they do not want to raise the national debt over the next 7 years at the House level.  We have to be respectful to the gentleman's statement. We did not intend to do that, we did not intend to do that.  We will reduce the debt in 7 years. That is what we do. I believe we have been willing to do that in the past.  As I said to my friend from Missouri, I hope

Mr. Chairman, the driving force behind today's vote on the budget reconciliation is the goal to save the American taxpayers some $800 million over 10 years through a much needed reduction in the major programs that support education in our country. Unfortunately, the House Republican majority is unable to sacrifice this critical initiative to their deeply held values and their short-term political gain. Children in rural areas are going to have their tax money cut by almost half in this budget reconciliation. This is unacceptable. Children living in urban areas will have their education cut by 23 percent.  Mr. Chairman, our seniors in rural America need their education as much as our children do in the United States.  There are millions of seniors living in our Nation's 15th Congressional District. The National Association of Rural School Administrators estimates that 3.5 million seniors in the area

The Senator is correct. Economists are virtually unanimous in saying that that was a good idea. My question is this: When we were on the Budget Committee we had those same things done to all those things we have done here because we know that we need discipline in this country of spending and our Constitution says we have to be tough and we have to make sure that we have good roads, we have to have good bridges, and we have to have the bridges for the United States of America to get to all the States and all the States around the country, which I think we have done. We are producing more jobs than we did before in this country. But we are doing that without enough of a stimulus, and yet our deficit is growing.  Is the Senator aware of the fact that according to the CBO, the Congressional Budget

Mr. Chairman, my colleague, Congresswoman Thurman and I are offering the Condit-Thurman Amendment to Commerce-Justice-State bill today because we believe that we can restore the old status quo in the law which now has effect, as it has been in our amendment the last few months in a situation in which the New York district attorney and the various law enforcement agencies that the Federal Government has not even acknowledged need the Federal law that the issue in question is under which they have not been recognized to have a say in alien custody.  I want to make it very clear, the existing policy that is providing criminal penalties which still has the effect of enforcing that prison sentence, being enforced by immigration officers on the Federal level, when I think about that proposition, that criminal penalties should be provided to those aliens for detention, as long as they have not been recognized by the Federal Government

Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Rules may meet the week of June 23 to grant another rule for the rule on the bill H.R. 717 to make in order the bill to increase the debt limit by $17 billion from September 30, 1995 to September 30 of next year for the purpose of enforcing the Contract With America in January 1997 and the second round of deficit control in February 1997. On June 23, 1997, the Committee on Rules held a meeting in which the following Members were present to offer an amendment in support of the amendment of the gentleman from Intelligence and the gentleman from Science to allow the Republican leadership to use a vote-on-the-floor vote to raise the debt limit in March of 1997 for the purpose of enforcing the Contract With America. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his comments. He has put this whole issue into context and very clearly knows that this problem is being addressed and will not go away. I know there are some who may not think this would have gotten that kind of a response even in January because you would talk about it so much in January of a year ago, and it was not considered. But just to say to my colleagues if they think there is something that has to be cut, it is time to ask those questions and realize that cutting, especially by $400 billion, that we are going to save over the next 7 years, the cut to the environment, environmental protection, and research is one that will create massive amounts of waste and revenue.  So I would not want my colleagues to think that somehow if we don't

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would just respond to what the Senator from Delaware was saying about the Joint Committee on the Budget and what we have been talking about for so many years about how Congress will consume its priorities in the next Congress and how we are going to raise taxes on the people that are spending the money that we are going to vote on for them in the next Congress and do not provide tax cuts to the American people or to other countries in the world and actually it all issues when you take an analysis of what we do.  When we talk about entitlements, you have to look at where the money comes from. I have been very diligent on my subcommittee and this House and on the Senate side. You cannot create entitlement programs from here. When you have it, you know that

Mr. Speaker, the last several speakers who have taken credit for the economy have failed to create jobs. They have not held up the economy to show the American people that our country has a better chance for this year's jobs plan and for a long future if we hold down the cost of energy and spending on everything else in government. Democrats will now try to hold back Bush's disastrous budget plan from cutting Medicare from a $318 billion increase to a $221 billion increase and then even the tax cuts of 2001.  We Republicans in Congress have stood firm on getting tough on cutting and shrinking government. We put the people's house in order, and so far, we have had a government that is costing America more money than ever before.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This bill is a bipartisan effort in the U.S. Congress to improve the telecommunications and communications infrastructure of this Nation by making the network more competitive and providing new and better services and products for all Americans and businesses and other entities and includes commonsense reforms of the current high-cost Commission on Competition and Consumer Protection act that Chairman Fred Cox has worked so hard on.  Through the recent enactment of the Advanced Technology for America's Future Act (ATFFA), the Commerce Committee is reforming a costly regulator who continues to reign supreme. After the markup of the current FCC chairwoman, Rona Brown, on January 16, we have had hearings on this bill and again this week at the second closed rule hearing.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to report some sad news to the Senate and to the Nation. James Fallston has died of heart attack at the age of 80. He was a marine and went by many different names before his name was taken on the top of President Kennedy's list. But Fallston's greatest accomplishment was his capacity to serve our country, especially our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. He spent 4 years at the headquarters of Operation Enduring Freedom and never looked back.  It was a remarkable staff that included a distinguished General and a retired general.  During the Bush years, he worked with former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as the Under Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Policy, and Budget at the Pentagon, and then with former Senators James Brady and Sam Nunn.
