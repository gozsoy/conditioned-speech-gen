Mr. President, President Obama recently signed a very important bill which could affect the very same citizens that he so often says are the most vulnerable to fraud and abuse in government. But it also changes the balance of power between the Federal Government and the States in ways that might create a serious problem for the people of my State and which the President and the State of Connecticut would like to avoid. The changes in the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act put the administration on the defensive not just over the issue of lending requirements and collection standards, but over a whole array of other areas where it would take real burden off of States and local governments. Some argue that it will

This is a fundamental right for all Americans, whether they be in a case of criminal trial or Federal judge or court of law. It is no longer necessary for certain cases to proceed through the first instance on the merits of the question of judicial review, and it is no longer needed for others to proceed through the standard process and eventually reach the Supreme Court.

That's a difference of $2.2 trillion.  Republicans voted for the budget resolution when it came back from conference that would have provided for a modest cut to Medicare of $265 billion, and Democrats voted to do the exact same thing. So this is not a tax cut for the wealthy, and this is not a Medicare

There is nothing in the Medicare program that prohibits the political activities of physicians and all other political candidates from participating in the system which provides for the funding of health care for the seniors and disabled in this country.

Cutting taxes has the potential to reduce the cost of goods and services, boost economic growth and encourage investment. Importantly, tax reductions help spur economic growth and reduce the deficit by lowering Federal taxes paid and net revenues collected by the Federal Government.  Tax reform programs provide tax incentives to individuals and companies to help create jobs and expand their businesses. A tax reform program benefits both consumers and businesses. Policies that reduce taxes reduce their cost and benefit to consumers while encouraging businesses to provide services and capital to boost

<|endoftext|>The American people want Congress to get serious about the $20 trillion national debt which has run up since 2001 and the alternative tax package that is before us which they think would be better than this alternative plan. All they want is balanced budgets, and yet these proposals are all about balancing the budget in 7 years using a so-called pay-as-you-go approach to the budget so you cannot have one without the other. So they are really in opposition to what I am talking about here today because the question is really whether Congress is really serious about getting serious about reducing the national debt because most Americans do not think Congress is serious about

Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that it is about time that we started doing some serious work on health care in this country. We have now got more than 10 million people uninsured in America. We have talked a lot about the premiums and deductibles and the out-of-pocket expenses. We have talked about insurance company policies that fail to cover even the most basic of the basic services, and that is why I join my friend, Mr. Blute from Missouri, in the well and talking about the creation of a publicly supported health care plan that will take a comprehensive approach to health care reform and make it available to everyone in this country

Mr. President, first of all, there is no reason why the Senator from Maryland cannot come to the floor today and offer her amendment to the pending measure. That is what we have in our understanding of the situation in which we find ourselves. I will not object. I know the majority leader has a strong interest in resolving the pending matter and I appreciate his support. But I ask that the pending amendment be called up and that the pending amendment be allowed to be debated on the Senate floor and not be set aside pending the arrival of other pending amendments on the subject of our legislation to deal with some other legislative matter that will be on the floor.

Mr. Chairman, the question before this body is simple: Why are we continuing the status quo?

The number of people killed by gun violence in the United States since that time has gone from 6,290 to 8,910 in that time. That is a 20-percent increase in the number of mass shootings in this country in those 14 years, and those numbers are higher than the number of people killed by suicide.

I had hoped that the Senate would offer this body a clean clean and honest-to-goodness balanced budget amendment during consideration of the Senate budget resolution. That is what the Senate resolution calls for.  For those who are concerned about fairness, I should first note that this is not a vote on fairness. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have repeatedly stated their opposition to this balanced budget amendment.  The Senate resolution, as written, will stifle what many may view as the fair negotiation of the budget by many of the proposals being considered in this House
