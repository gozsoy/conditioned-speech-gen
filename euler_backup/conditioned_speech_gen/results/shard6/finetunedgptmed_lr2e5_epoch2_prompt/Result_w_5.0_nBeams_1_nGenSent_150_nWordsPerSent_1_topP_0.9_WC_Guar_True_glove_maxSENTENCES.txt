Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. I hope that after I speak for 5 or 10 minutes on this issue I will not have to make the same decision again because I think it is a mistake in the process today to have this kind of the thing in place for 2 years because it is not going to work in the first 2 years and it is not going to work for the next 2 years because when we get there it is not going to be time when people are going to understand what is really going on, and I think the General Accounting Office just talked to us about it. But I know we are talking about something on the verge of being a crisis, something that is going to have a ripple effect throughout our society and, if we do not get this stuff in place, it is going to go away and

So do you get, my colleagues, the hypocrisy? They slashed the tax collectors, paid eight or nine times more in their salaries, and they have cut defense in half because the Republicans slashed it three times over the last four years and they are now going to cut education by more than four times over the last four years. So they are doing it with two on one and then they want to cut private Medicare, the program for seniors and the frail elderly in this country. What do they want to cut when they filibuster a bill to help the junior Chamber come to the floor and offer amendments?  They want to see a wall in the middle of the wall, try to cut everything that exists, just like they cut the budget by $75 billion in just one day.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the smoke is housing crisis foreclosures. The fire is the general economy because the real economy is now in crisis because of two factors which go hand in hand with the housing crisis. Both of those things are real estate and taxes. President Clinton has responded by enacting legislation which will force up to $6 billion in tax increases on owners of all home ownership in this country. We in the Senate bill would be pushing down mortgage rates. We are doing something about real estate in this country. We do not have to increase taxes on people owning homes in this country. That is what the Washington Post does. But, believe me, if the media were to pick up on the Federal Government was driving up prices, the news media would be covering it and all of this discussion would be gone.

This bill contains sufficient resources to increase the yield of lab grown raw materials on FDA controlled premises to approximately one-half ton per day. This bill also provides that the presence of laboratory grown raw material on premises is provided at no cost to Hastings residents.

Yet what do these gloom and doom folks do when they find themselves in a real time crunch of spending that might slow the big spending programs that we all love so much and Uncle Sam looks to to make some quick buck?  Well, as the Republicans are trying to convince the public, the House of Representatives has passed the largest tax increase in our Nation's history in order to cut entitlement spending and the deficit, taking money from people and programs that are in real need, cutting them when they really need it, doing it in a way that doesn't squeeze government on an ever-growing budget.

It is also for this reason that I join in support of the Republican leadership's initiative to pass a ban on soft money so as to reduce the influence of special interests. But we cannot defeat the flow of dollars by prohibiting contribution limits and other limits on Members of Congress.  The American public can understand the meaning of the full faith and credit of the United States of America if it will give big banks and major corporations a chance to raise as much money as possible without any limits on their contributions to Congressional candidates or candidates for Governor.

This spending increase was entitled ``Saving Social Security and Medicare.'' This is certainly worthy of praise, merit, and close scrutiny. But let me expand upon this.  President Clinton told us that we would need to do more to rescue the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. He referred to Medicare as ``sheer trouble.''

It is particularly important, Mr. Speaker, that I rise today to remember the sacrifice and sacrifice of a Marine friend who tragically lost his life on that ill-advised and unsightly excursion that hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijackers hijables biggert

Madam Chair, this amendment was going to be offered by Mr. Markey, and he strongly opposed the amendment today because the EPA did not answer his questions in the years 2008 and 2009 that I raised earlier in this debate. As a result, the EPA and the fossil fuel companies went ahead and spent $1 billion and $2 billion to increase greenhouse gases emissions in that time period.  What does this mean for the average person who is not a big polluter or a big polluter who owns polluting assets or a percent owned by somebody who owns fossil fuel assets? They are not going to see a big paycheck when they have to sell their and other investors' or shareholders' shares.  For us who are, as I said, big polluters, this has been a regulatory issue for years, and we should not ignore the fact

Mr. Chairman, this bill authorizes funds that veterans are entitled to for their disability compensation and all forms of VA housing.  The legislation is not enough, Mr. Chairman. There are too many families who suffer the devastating impact of losing a loved one through the Vietnam and Iraq conflicts.  Many of my veterans who served in both conflicts find themselves on the street without a home.

That's what this debate is about. That's not about tax cuts for the wealthy. That's not about Medicare or the retirement savings accounts. That's not about corporate welfare.

I first would like to take a moment to thank Senator McCain for his support of the Uruguay round of trade agreements and the Panama provisions that address tax havens and offshore financing. We look forward to strengthening international rules of the road on tax havens and the government financing of corruption. These are trade agreements that have broad bipartisan support. The Obama administration is strongly committed to expanding economic opportunity and entrepreneurship. I am proud to be working with Senator McCain and others on this issue, as is our former colleague, Senator Mack, who is currently chairing a new bipartisan trade task force on the issue.  I will also note that the multinational pharmaceutical companies included in these trade agreements are the most successful multinational corporations in the world, and our commitment to enforcing intellectual property rights through the United

Mr. Speaker, after decades of Washington irresponsibility, Americans are facing nearly $17 trillion of debt this year alone. If Congress continues on the path it is on now for a decade and a half, that is more than Americans have contributed to the national debt for Washington to date. That is a debt of more than $5 trillion. It is more than our national debt is now. This Congress is borrowing more than Barack Obama has borrowed in his entire life, and this debt is projected to increase significantly.  So these numbers are almost too outrageous to contemplate. If we pass the balanced budget amendment this year, Americans will realize that Washington has spent more than it has made, and that is exactly what is happening. And if we do not address this problem before our grandchildren have too much of a chance to pay off this debt, we will become

It would have more resources. So there are more resources in the bill.  I would say to my friend, I do not know what in the world it takes to undermine the AARP.

I would like to take this opportunity to honor the leadership of the Armed Services Committee that led the fight for this legislation in the Armed Services Committee and in the Senate. This legislation has been advanced on a bipartisan basis with votes in both the last two Congresses and in the last Congress on two different occasions by Democratic Members and one Republican Member nationwide.  The bill I introduce today was the result of intense effort, bipartisan compromise, and understanding of the critical national security interests at stake as we consider the 2002 Defense Authorization Act. This bill is important not just because it responds to a grave national security crisis, but also because it does so by protecting military personnel and

So a $14 billion bridge loan seems rather small in light that all this administration, most of the Republicans in this House and some of the majority in this House are in favor of that type of a small bridge loan. The history of America is not pretty when we have a regime run by the Soviet Union and Germany and Japan. It should not be an easy one to finance when the government is owned by the Government at large and the auto companies and auto parts companies.  The automobile industry itself in 1978 was a shipload of surplus labor when President Jimmy Carter took over and in 1979 they had $1 billion surplus in the auto parts industry. Since that time, their business, auto parts of the auto industry, has fallen apart. This is no way to run a major business.  But there is more we can do,

It is a fact that private schools have made tremendous progress over the last decade, and according to our most recent national rankings there are not only students in private schools in the United States that qualify for private schools, but in the entire United States, the private school test scores for 1 year, the score of a test taken at the end of 1 year, show that 50 percent of all private school students come from families with

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I'm incredibly disappointed by the Supreme Court's ruling to uphold the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. We in this House of Representatives are given a unique constitutional right to enact legislation that will help millions of Americans get the health care they need and expect without making it more expensive or worse than it already is today for all Americans. We can repeal this bad bill in the coming months and ensure our economy remains strong.  Even as we have taken actions, we must ensure that people have access to affordable, quality health care. It is only right that we give power back to the people so that they have a say on their own health care decisions.  I have introduced legislation in this Congress, and will be offering the Reforming Health Care Access Act, which would take power from Washington to the people.

I thank the Senator. Mr. President, some of the issues that did not come up in our committee discussions about this would come up in this legislation but they will not come up if we make it a crime to offer any amendments that include information technology or security improvements because that is the first amendment to the law to come before the Senate which provides for these standards. If the other provisions of this bill are not possible because the amendment is not possible because the committee is not allowed to move to it because of its non board-wide language, as is the case with other information technology provisions in the bill--we are going to have to do a real supplemental appropriations bill to deal with it--as a matter of fact, it would not be wise to pass that bill unless we have all of the circumstances fully under our control so we can provide

Madam Speaker, yesterday Virginia District Court Judge Henry Hudson's decision striking down one provision of the Affordable Care Act was welcome news for the millions of Americans whose health insurance plans, because they are so complex and interconnected, are completely out of reach. The people they count on to protect them and keep them healthy are facing a 21st-century federal government that is ripping health care out from under them by forcing them to choose between plans that are good for them and plans that are a bad deal for them.  That is why I have come to the floor repeatedly to express my strong support for the Affordable Care Act. I was proud to sign the largest expansion of health care coverage to date and to offer a more limited, government-run, government-run alternative to the Republican government takeover of health care.

Let me try it one more time. The Senator is saying the States can make their own laws on this. That is one way to make this work better for them because they will be allowed to do it and they can take it as it is if they do not get the money as they come up in time for the 7-year amendment cycle that is on the Senate bill now. But if they passed it, the States cannot do anything else other than continue it without this amendment. So they have to be excluded, and this does not allow the States to provide for welfare.  Let me finish on another point that is perhaps the underlying assumption of what the Senator is talking about. Under this system, the States, when they contract with the private sector for welfare, not only are they going to offer a continuation to the welfare

The service chiefs have also made the case for shrinking our base structure. In testimony before the Armed Services Committee earlier this month, the service chiefs were all of one mind that the Department of Defense should maintain bases in the years ahead so that the troops have the necessary equipment to defend themselves in an armed conflict in the future and to ensure that they have forces, resources, and equipment at their disposal to protect our homeland.  It is important to emphasize that the administration, the House Armed Services Committee, and this Congress cannot resolve the issue of the oversize military by arguing endlessly about how to cut the size of the force. Instead, these are issues of priorities. For example, the House Armed Services Committee proposes a cut in the force of just 1,500 troops for the next year, and the administration's budget calls for only 5

Mr. Speaker, in today's Special Order, my colleagues and I will focus on the important problem of trade deficits and trade policy in the United States Congress. In this Special Order we will focus on the fact that many aspects of the way we address our important trade deficit have come to be called into question, both at home and abroad, and have come to be accepted as legitimate approaches for improving the integrity of the foreign trade system.  Mr. Speaker, there are many organizations and political leaders around the world who call for a greater emphasis on U.S. trade policy because, they claim, the United States is making too much of its goods and service. To this, I say simply, if a country is producing too much of its own products, it can be more competitive in international trade. A country that exports something can engage in

This act has broad bipartisan support. I introduce this bill today because the Clinton administration's 2001 amnesty bill is based on inaccurate statistics about the number of illegal aliens.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the continuing resolution to fund our government for the remainder of the year and particularly for the Nation's National Park Service. The resolution passed by the House earlier today is the result of more than 3 years of work by the House and the Senate to provide an essential and necessary funding bill for the Nation's parks and the programs that support them and that act as an important benchmark against which the rest of the federal government is measured.  I support this bill because I think it is consistent with the concept that we should, at a minimum, ensure that park funding is for the benefit of the Nation's park users.  Last month, a report issued by the administration's National Parks Policy Division found that the national parks account for more than a third of the budget of the Park Service. But

The United States has more than 400 nuclear weapons and over 3,000 nuclear- procedure sites around the globe, and in this case the Congress should not approve this nuclear transfer. This transfer will result in far greater than expected savings in taxpayers' dollars and there is not much of a savings from Massachusetts to Rhode Island. It may even increase the probability of an accidental detonation of a nuclear weapon at some future date.

I have the greatest respect for the many thoughtful people on both sides of the aisle on this issue but I think that when you have sophisticated elements, one of which I think we will find to be known by the Iranian leadership in fact, the President had it exactly right when he said the Iranians are the most dangerous of our adversaries because they have a long track record of behaving in a systematic way.

I think that is important for meaningful deficit reduction.  The second point I would make to you is that there is no guarantee that will be enacted, and it does not provide the ability to sustain deficits.

Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly correct. In the little time we have remaining, I want to make sure that we understand that these new rules that are being proposed and that passed in the House would have significantly cut the budget for the United States Government in the next year and a half and would have cut the next two bills from the Federal budget. These new rules that are being proposed will, in fact, reduce the Federal Government budget for the next year and a half and the next two bills from the Federal budget.  The last one was a car maintenance bill that would have cut more than $140 million. Today we are talking about when these new rules are coming out, over the next 2 years, we could be looking at that cost to the Federal Government of $157 billion. That is an increase of $137 billion.

If enacted into law, this procedure would ban most abortions at any stage, let alone the birth of a child, if the mother's life is endangered. If an abortion occurs in the most favorable conditions, then we can justifiably say it is in the mother's best interests to have the procedure.  Congress and the Supreme Court have the ability to tell law enforcement authorities if they should prosecute this practice. But when the decision is made to prosecute, the decision must be narrowly tailored. Abortion is both morally and medically necessary in the circumstances for which it

Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Banks have all aggressively insured borrowers in loans that have affordable rates. Yet mortgages lenders couldn't insure borrowers with mortgages lenders couldn't afford to insure mortgages lenders couldn't insure mortgages lenders couldn't insure mortgages lenders couldn't insure mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages borrowers insured mortgages mortgages borrowers insured mortgages mortgages borrowers insured fha

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. This important bill would significantly increase investor confidence in the American economy and job creation. The provision in this bill that would allow for long-term debt retirement plans that encourage retirement savings through a qualified IRA would also allow senior citizens to avoid being taxed on their investment success and tax opportunities.  I would like to note for my colleagues that this same bipartisan bill passed the Senate on a vote of 74 to 21 last year by a unanimous vote.

Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Nickles, in introducing the Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 2005. This legislation would allow States to consider the right of States to allow for a voluntary transition to the end of Federal nonpoint source waste as a means to reduce the President's nonpoint source power requirements in the 1992 Energy Policy Act in the case of ground based facilities because the decision would be made by States and the Federal Government as to what State actions would best meet Federal interests, given the State party's choice and public opposition Senator Nickles just described.  This legislation is necessary because the proposal in H.R. 6170 makes it possible to consider land disposal at a maximum level of 30 percent of the current maximum increase in the nonpoint source waste allowances. After 30 percent, the amounts in the bill would be adjusted based upon

While the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) proposes to overturn that promise, it does so with legislative procedure which violates our Nation's laws upholding basic democratic values of equality and self-government. The American people overwhelmingly rejected the attacks on voting rights embodied in the election of 2000 and helped ensure that we would never again engage in a voting rights experiment. This amendment flies in the face of that historic decision and abdicates our respect for the concept of equal protection under the law.

Mr. President, it certainly is no surprise that at this relatively late stage of the debate over the alternative minimum tax the critics of the tax have resorted to the same refrain about the problem of overregulation that has been the subject of a lot of debate during the debate that has been going on on the Senate Finance Committee regarding the legislation that is under consideration on the law books and that is being sponsored by the gentleman from Texas.

To be clear, this bill is not about taking our Nation further down the road of illegal drug use, illegal drug use among young people. There is plenty of room for debate, and there are legitimate differences over drug policy.  However, this issue of drug screening raises legitimate, if not fatal, questions about the drug War on Drugs and an approach that is losing its soul, and that is the debate over whether mandatory drug screening is a smart, sensible, pro-child policy and an approach that effectively addresses the health and safety of children.

Mr. President, in the early 1950s, at a time when political backrooms were still smoke-filled basement offices with little fanfare, the President of the United States came up with a way to make the Government work better and less long-lasting than the public had ever expected. He suggested the introduction of a major series of tax cuts which would in time turn the country into the most important in the early 1960s. These were called tax cuts in the sense that the taxes they raised would also be the tax cuts of choice for the American people in the near term. The Republican congressional leadership did Iowa things, which would become the motto of the era, and what is more was a vision of the American dream for this country.  President Kennedy used the model used to raise taxes in the 1940's to create a political union which would encompass the next

We all need to create jobs in this country and get people back to work. This is not simply a call for a tax increase. It is a call to get back to work.  I am voting to provide $50 million to jump start unemployment benefits and creating jobs. It is not only $50 million, this is a real reflection of

We should be here today passing a clean debt ceiling and creating jobs; but in this Government shutdown the only thing that is clear is that Republicans will not allow the clean debt ceiling to pass the Senate because they think the American people will be too upset over what has been going on here in the country today for that to be good for the Nation and good for the country and for the country as a whole and for our heritage. That is why the American people are so upset about what has been going on here in the House and the Senate over the last week and the last month and now this program, the continuing resolution, because what they want to do is begin to create jobs in America and not jeopardize the continuing resolution or the clean debt ceiling for the American people.

It should also be noted that the Turkish Government has been the prime sponsor of the attacks against the parliament, as well as to a much lesser degree the Turkish Government of the brutal regime of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkey.

East Timor was South America's last remaining province of the European Union at the time of the reunification of East and South in 1994. It is this island nation that is fighting its way out of the grip of Indonesia's brutal military.

That is what we did with Presidents Reagan and Bush. They would veto the bills, the programs. We would come to the floor and we would offer alternatives and they would not want to participate in them because they would have to provide the money and the paperwork and they would be willing to co-sign the executive branch bills because they believe in us as the executive branch, and we would not back them down with Reagan and Bush or other Presidents for that matter.  So that is what we tried to do with the welfare reform laws. We do not want to back down from that. We want to get a balanced approach to welfare reform legislation. We want to compromise because all of us are worried about the Federal debt, and I think this administration is anxious to do its part and the House of Representatives has been doing its part in all

Mr. Chair, with all due respect--and I do have ample respect for my colleague from Texas--I would say that the title of this amendment could very well have read `` reclamation refuge land studies and studies of the potential desecration of one of the Nation's most well-known historic and culturally significant places in Alaska.'' I suspect that my colleague is well aware that I was addressing such a hypothetical here today.  My colleague seems to be implying that I have been engaging in a search for Wyoming or Missouri. I wish to offer another quote from a letter I wrote to the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests dated May 25, 2003. In the letter I wrote, I argued that the BLM has not completed a review of the pristine area between the two communities to allow access, and that its new rule could substantially

Mr. President, this past week, Americans lined up outside the Library of Congress for the chance to see President Bush taking the oath of office and taking the oath to our country from the First Lady just past this past Sunday night. The first time they were treated to an opportunity to see a President take a position is something that we should all be very proud of.  Americans remember that inaugural Address in 1989, when the President had on his first inaugural address a red carpet of Presidents, not just Presidents, but also two former Presidents. It was a massive event. And Americans saw here a man who, the first time he took office, after the defeat of the Soviet Union in 1991, started the end of the cold war, laid the groundwork for the International Monetary Fund in Washington, one of the largest institutions in the world, under the

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bipartisan amendment, which would benefit counties throughout the Nation whose counties are suffering from the under bipartisan Medicaid Payment Reform Act of 2003. My amendment would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to consider the county income tax or property tax in determining the amount of the public lands fee reduction that would be owed to the counties.  According to the GSA, 75 percent of counties in this country are in need of a fee reduction. In my county of St. Louis, a total of 20 percent of their Medicaid payments to counties come due in the form of income taxes.  The GOP took for granted that counties should bear the burden of the Medicaid program, an unfair assumption they would continue under H.R. 1.

There are many who might question the success of the Government of this country in reducing the amount of money that we spend.

And to explain that particular provision of this underlying amendment, the substance of which is to say that the President should look to balance the budget in 5 years by 2002, not 2003, not 2005, but by 2002, there are four reasons why that is. One is because the contribution of Government policy in the period 2003 to 2005 will be $1.5 trillion. The amount in the 4 years immediately preceding the first year of a balanced budget will be $2.5 trillion. In other words, not just in 2 or 3 years, but in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

And the American people should be very proud of these developments that have occurred. But the important issue here is not Saddam Hussein but Hassan Khadim, who is now one of the six American military prisoners of war.  These are good men. They are very conscientious, they are very hard working, and they have served us so honorably in both Iraq and Afghanistan and particularly now that they are out in the custody of the United States.

Frankly, I think as we all know today we are a little too dependent on exports of our oil and very much concerned about the amount of money we get for foreign aid in this budget that frankly is too much for us to do anything about it and it makes our country vulnerable.  We are spending a total of $20 billion to export oil. The Clinton administration got together a bipartisan effort to cut spending, and the result is $20 billion or $30 billion more over the next 5 years we are going to be giving to foreign countries to buy gasoline than we are going to be giving to the folks we are trying to help in America. So we know what a burden that is.  And with the Clinton administration, these folks were going to get $5 billion a

Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, one of the important points he made a moment ago in the short time I have been here is that I have no difficulty with women having reproductive health care. I think they ought to have access to physicians who treat them medically and who can treat patients on a patient basis so they are not put at a disadvantage. What the Senator from Arkansas says is a key to the overall legislation because he thinks about all of the people in his State who work in ordering abortion services, who go to delivery rooms where they spend their days of the week being told, as soon as you are present, that you can have only abortions if you bring in another doctor from elsewhere in the country.  I feel pretty strongly we want to make sure we give women the best health care that they can have. But I

Madam Speaker, today, the House will, once again, vote to restrict access to our reproductive health care. This action will make it even more difficult for millions of women and their families to get coverage to end their pregnancies or to keep their health insurance plans if they get them due to health reasons. This plan would make it more difficult for millions of people to get equal pay for equal work because they have a preexisting condition and must choose between access to care or being able to afford coverage.  So we are coming at this from a different vantage point. It was like hearing the speech today that President Trump gave that was universally condemned by his critics as just a bunch of assertions that were inaccurate and baseless. Yet, for all the things the administration said, none of them were true, and there is no reason to believe anything the President

The bill that is before us today will not do that. This is a purely partisan bill to protect corporate tax breaks for the largest corporations in the country and the Heritage Foundation, but most importantly, it goes after the American people's tax dollars.  Democrats are proud of the changes that we have made to this bill. This bill fixes a portion of the Senate bill that breaks that promise.

It is important that we have both of these measures because as the budget and the underlying legislation are considered as part of this package as well as the other areas in the package, I think it is important that we have an opportunity to continue to provide adequate funds to the agencies that provide for agriculture rural development, especially those who are trying to help small businesses grow and in particular, but we need a little help for the aging farmers in the rural areas as well.  In order to do that, as I understand it, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] has gone through the process. He has not taken all of the amendments from the other side. I do not know if the gentleman would agree that I can correct that.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, this is an earmark designated for the Philadelphia Museum of Art, transportation improvement projects, and it was designed to fund the school bus program in this area in the City of Philadelphia. This fund was never intended for the city of Philadelphia and I would be happy to work with the Office of the Budget and with the city to work out a way to fund the funds so that we can get them to that school bus as quickly as possible so that the children can get to that bus as well as drive to it and return to the airport.  As I said last year, this is budget debt in America.

Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of this comprehensive reform of our Nation's crop insurance program. During the 1994 farm bill negotiations Congress had good faith negotiations over crop insurance reforms that would result in agricultural policyholder equity in all aspects of the industry, including the allocation of capital and insurance resources between insurance companies and the agencies managing the program. Chairman George Mitchell and Chairman Bruce Babbitt, and my colleagues on the subcommittee, fought long and hard to create a level playing field for all agricultural interests and to offer alternatives to a large insurance company monopoly. At the final conference committee in August of 1994, the report of the House conferees on the farm bill reflected a number of compromises and key reforms which we believe will insure agricultural policyholders in the marketplace, and provide reliable, uniform insurance to farmers.  Over the past 2 years

The yield here on the spending side that the Senator and I brought to the McCain-Feingold bill is equivalent to 2 percent of the entire national debt of the United States of America.

Mr. President, in October 1960, then-U.S. Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy, visited the University of Michigan and spoke about his plans to become a Senator. I will never forget the then candidate for President saying at the time of his election that the Presidential election in November had been the ``first opportunity he had ever had to be himself for all the time he has spent as a Republican Senator and a Democrat in the Congress.'' Fitzgerald Kennedy brought this speech home to his constituents by doing the responsible thing, simply moving to the side when we called him on his decision to run.  After only 10 years as a Member of the House of Representatives, John Fitzgerald Kennedy ran for President in 1960. President Kennedy's moving and insightful speech that night honored Americans at the polls and in November 1960 reminded us of the realities of the pressures, responsibilities, and disappointments of the

In the month of August 1968 the Nation was also in the early stages of a war on civil rights and racial injustice in this country. April 7, 1968 was a Saturday.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the Democrats continue to scare the American public into thinking that Republicans are coming to the floor and proposing legislation that will force lower prescription drug prices. This is simply not the case.  It is certainly true that the Democrats have been pushing legislation to help lower the cost of prescription drugs. In May of this year, the Democrat majority passed legislation that would have provided a tax break to drug companies that they use to pay their suppliers. At that time, the pharmaceutical industry provided strong opposition to this legislation, stating that ``corporate profit should not be driving government decisions.''  The year after that, in September of this year, the Democrat majority failed to allow a vote on a prescription drug bill at the House of Representatives floor. During this session of Congress, the Democratic majority has now launched

I also commend the chairman, a friend of mine, Mr. Obey, who is always there when we make major changes.

If the American people are to have jobs in the future and to have hope for the future, they need to have confidence in the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve's key monetary policy decision was an unwise one. We can judge what went wrong based on the economic results. At the end of June, we were back here again. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ had been up, and we were back in business again. In the 12 months that the Fed's policies have been in place, they have failed to maintain the U.S. economy. For the first time since the Federal Reserve began keeping track, inflation was below 1 percent

That is exactly the way this is going to happen because this year we want it to be a good bill that will not be changed by the chairman and the committee members and not only that statement by the last two Republican leaders but what we have been trying to do, at least in my opinion, as the chairman of the subcommittee, the chairman of the full committee, to get in this bill what we can reasonably afford.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3307, a bill to create the Northeast Institute of Environmental Research and Policy in the year 2000. This resolution aims to support and advance the development of integrated environmental management programs and strategies for the Northeast. The study of environmental protection issues in the Northeast is important to enhance environmental health and prevention.  I am pleased that the Northeast Institute was granted the funding to increase its membership, help ensure that environmental laws were updated, and further refine the effectiveness of the study. This institute has already begun examining environmental issues and impacts in the Northeast and is working to improve the measures developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Management to improve and disseminate information and interpretive materials about environmental conditions and issues.

It had not been brought to the floor yet by the time the debate had ended on that bill last week when we came out of the committee last week and the agency bill had not been brought to the floor. It was brought up the last week, and a vote on this issue was taken.  It is not that we have not seen much movement on this since Senator Grassley suggested it.

Mr. President, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. This is the report language which is necessary for the schools that need it most in this bill because this amendment is really about the children in our country who have not been properly taught how to read and how to be sensitive to the things that are important to the child.  The amendment says to the States that now they must maintain reading standards that are currently in existence in this country. That would be what is being proposed in this amendment. In our local schools, the law already allows for a minimum reading standards of 599. It simply says that if a school today at least requires an 8th grade reading requirement, we have to have to go above that. We are in a world of trouble if we go below that.  I urge a ``no'' vote.

Mr. President, I am here today to recognize a loss for the Murray office and our entire State.

The Post article went on to state that the entire 4-year loss for the office could be well over a half a billion dollars when all is said and done in the next year and that victory for all the residents of this great State of Montana will depend on our successful passage of the Native American Tax Fairness Act.

Madam Speaker, America's intervention in Libya was initially based on the international community's ``Responsibility to Protect'' doctrine, which is based on international agreement to put the will of the international community first, to seek the disarmament of and the political settlement to a civil war that has been agreed to by the United Nations Security Council and the governments of Libya and the rebels.  Our involvement in Libya quickly became a covert operation, deployed into contested areas without any of our knowledge. Last August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stopped questioning and investigating the Libyan leader at the helm of the country's Libya Investment Authority [LIA], their new and influential political advisory board, their former infrastructure investment office, and other investigations, all based on the ``Responsibility to Protect'' doctrine.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Sean Duffy, and other important legislation that we are introducing today. Congress must act on those taxes that give millions of Americans an opportunity to write off a part of their Federal debt that Congress cannot pay. Tax shelters and deferred taxation offer many families an opportunity to cut the Federal debt limit and take a risk against a higher or higher value of their Social Security and retirement checks. However, until we reform the Tax Code, tax shelters and deferred taxation have turned a net gain into a deficit-busting shell game. And now it is the Bush tax plan that calls for America's corporate tax rate to spike by another 11 or 12 percent in an attempt to cheat the American taxpayers out of their share of the $3.5 trillion deficit.

Mr. Chairman, the driving force behind today's vote on the budget reconciliation is the goal of continuing the President's policies and pushing for welfare reform without sacrifice for those who are currently receiving welfare. We are on the eve of a significant budget deficit in the next few years and in the well of the administration of many programs in the social safety net that are supporting our children.  One of the mandates of the welfare reform law is to eliminate the orgy of welfare dependency of taxpayers, as I will say later, forcing States and Federal workers to do more and more with less and less. However, I continue to hear concerns about the program from my constituents.  The welfare reform plan called for through the reforms and investment funds must include a flexible work requirement, meaningful nutritional assistance, and earned income tax credits. These actions must also assist those

The Senator is correct. Economists are virtually unanimous in saying that that was a good deal of money.

It cost about $14 billion.  We did not build the Keystone pipeline until this year, and the Senate legislation that is before us today that would allow that to be built without Government discipline did not come out of committee and was not a separate bill to the Constitution of the United States.

One study has found that, in 1996 the Republican Congress cut taxes for more than 1.5 million Americans. Speaker Gingrich has promised that those families that did not pay taxes would get tax relief. Today, millions of people are paying more and more in taxes. Many families make it through the 6 months of a year trying to make ends meet while their children receive their monthly check.
