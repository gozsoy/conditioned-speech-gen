Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. I hope that after I speak for 10 minutes today that the time I have will be spent in the interest of the country and in the interest of this country because there has been a lot of years and a lot of important work done on this, but I do think that there is some truth in the fact that in the early days, some people in this House, even in this town, have done a lot of work that has not been properly accounted for.  When we started the GATT, we did not have any statistics about the labor force participation of American workers. We did not have the number of workers that we have now.  It was not until the debate on GATT, and we came out with the American Competitiveness Act, that we began to begin to

I will vote to pass the Senate bill, but I do so with a sense of urgency. We have a very, very serious problem. It is the economy. It is the house, and it is the economy.

Hastings versus United States is a classic case in which the courts are trying to determine whether or not the Federal Government can use its power to regulate a commercial activity. I think the record demonstrates that the Federal Government cannot regulate a commercial activity under the Communications Act of 1934.  The Communications Act is one of the most important laws that the Congress has passed. Its power is very important. If the Congress were to pass an amendment to the Communications Act to limit the FCC's authority to regulate a commercial activity, it would fall in line with other laws such as the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Communications Act has had a very significant impact

Mr. Speaker, the gloom, doom, and depressed say the economy is in trouble. The naysayer's gloom is more than a little bit more than that. It is time for Uncle Sam to spend the next 8 years more on a series of tax cuts than we are going to spend on education, health care, housing, or other worthy domestic priorities.  How can we justify continuing to do nothing on an issue that is so important to the future of this country?  To those who say we are doing too little to solve the economic problems, I say, you are wrong. You cannot cut education by 50 percent and still get the job done. You cannot cut health care by 50 percent and still get the job done. You cannot cut housing by 50 percent and still get the job done.  To those who say that we should do more to

First of all, this proposal has nothing to do with destroying jobs. It is simply a recognition that we have a major problem. There are more than 40,000 banks in this country, and they do a good job.  Secondly, I think it is fair to say that some of the companies that are holding onto their bad assets are not getting as much bailouts as they would like. In fact, the most recent analysis shows that more than 70 percent of all the financial companies in this country are financially sound, and their bad assets are in very good shape

The Department of Justice has designated the distribution and importation of heroin in the United States as a Federal crime.

Mr. President, over the last many months millions of Americans have signed up for affordable and reliable health insurance because they believe America is the true place for them and their families to have health coverage. We have all heard stories of loved ones in our States and across our country who are receiving care, some as a result of the Affordable Care Act, that was passed just 2 years ago.  Unfortunately, as Americans continue to receive care, the government is shifting its focus from providing health care to directing it. Last week, the U.S. Government and the White House announced a plan to slow the rate of growth in health care spending in the next 10 years.  The new plan would decrease the amount of health care dollars spent by the Federal Government each year. This proposal would also limit the amount of money spent on Medicare by the

The legislation is a simple one. It requires lobbyists to register with the House of Representatives and disclose their contributors. The measure was introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] and passed by voice vote in the House on February 5, 1994. It enjoys strong support in the House and the Senate, and, if enacted, it would go into effect on April 1, 1994.  As was the case with the legislation passed by the House in March of last year, this measure is opposed by the Republican leadership of the House. In fact, the House leadership has declared it unnecessary and would not allow this bill to be considered under suspension

Mr. Speaker, I join my freshman colleagues this morning to call for a concerted effort to put insurance companies out of business by next session of Congress. This week the President will join us in a televised address to Congress, and the President is right on target. I was proud to serve with the President on the Health and Human Services Committee, and he was right to put the American people on notice. The American people want us to come together and pass the Affordable Care Act, but it is not the end of the world.  The Republican Congress and the President should not be the only ones standing up to the insurance companies. I will join my colleagues today in voting to hold an open rule for the Homeland Security appropriations bill. This bill provides critical resources for our homeland security. I will vote against the bill, and I will continue to

Madam Chair, this amendment was going to be offered by Mr. Markey, and he strongly opposes EPA emissions from coal-fired power plants. I rise in strong support of the underlying bill and in support of the 30 percent renewable portfolio standard amendment.  The EPA has come out with an exemption from the renewable portfolio standard. We have not seen the impact on the electricity grid. I believe this is a reasonable thing to do. We should not make it more difficult to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act.  My amendment makes clear that EPA must be given the flexibility to move forward with implementation of this important clean air law.

Mr. President, I will vote today to provide advice and consent to the ratification of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Participation Act of 1994. Lithuania and Latvia will have an important role to play in the U.N. effort to counter Soviet aggression in the Baltics. Their efforts in support of NATO expansion have made a real and positive contribution to the effort to reduce the threat of the Soviet Union from the Baltic states. It is clear to me that our alliance has been strengthened because of their support. The treaty, which is scheduled to go into effect on March 1, 1994, provides a means to reduce the threat of the Soviet Union to the Baltics.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, was established in 1949 to promote security and stability in the world's most densely populated area.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Administration Veterans Affairs Committee Amendment to the Senate bill before us today that will reform the Federal Government's disability compensation program to ensure Congress has adequate oversight.  While I believe the amendment is well-intentioned, I am disappointed that the underlying bill goes far beyond what is necessary to ensure our veterans receive the quality of care they have earned.  Specifically, the amendment would eliminate the mandatory monthly disability payments for a veteran's medical condition. Currently, if a veteran is disabled for 2 consecutive months, he or she receives no additional disability compensation.  Additionally, the bill would provide an alternative for disability compensation payments if a veteran's condition is not severe enough to justify the expense of a full year's treatment in an institutional setting.  This amendment is also necessary

Of these, a little over 5,000 are killed by gunfire from a concealed handgun. In my home State of Utah, that means nearly 10 people die every day from gun violence. In my home State of New Jersey, it means about one person every day from gun violence.  In 1996, the total number of homicides committed with firearms rose 3 percent over 1995, and there were an estimated 40,000 guns recovered during the year

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the Aviation, Transportation Safety, and Security Act of 1994. This bill is the aircraft and airline security legislation that we are going to be considering in Washington this week for the first time since the departure of President Clinton from office.  Since the tragic bombing of Pan Am 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, in July 1988, this Nation has responded to the terrorist threat of terrorists by having in place and enforcing the most rigorous security requirements for air travel. We have built into the airline industry and the airlines themselves an ability to assess, respond, and monitor potential terrorists before they travel on our airlines.  The legislation we are considering today is a more extensive response to this threat than the legislation passed by the Senate last year. I am particularly pleased that this bill includes the Senate amendment to H

And I think this bill is very important for that reason.  We have seen for years that we have not had the ability to truly market this country in a truly globalized marketplace. I think we are in the process of that and so is the Congress. I think we are in the process of elevating the power of the Federal Reserve to incent capital formation in a truly multigraded economy.

Mr. Speaker, one of our country's most treasured values is helping others who are less fortunate than we are make it here on our Nation's important highways. The people of Maryland's Second District proudly boast that their roads are some of the most traveled in the country. Unfortunately, this important practice has been neglected for far too long. The erosion of the trust between our citizens and our government has made our roads in Maryland unsafe and dangerous to use.  In order to improve safety, Congress created the National Highway Safety Administration. The new administration established a national highway safety organization and created a new, expanded toll collection system.  Mr. Speaker, this administration is not doing anything to protect our roads and highways from erosion. Instead, it is doing everything in its power to ensure that roadways remain unsafe for the traveling public. This legislation does

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume and say to the very able majority leader that this is not the time to do this kind of thing because what this is really about is not what the policies should be but what the fact of the matter is that we are debtors and the taxpayers are debtors. And the American people know that, and the American people know that, and they are right.  We are debtors, and we are doing this in a reckless way that is completely irresponsible. We are borrowing more money than we are spending. That is what this is about.

Mr. President, today we honor the life and service of Judge David Huff, whose passing last week left the State of Illinois a President of Judge-Executive Partnerships.  David was born in Scottsdale, AZ, on July 8, 1943. He was the son of Norma Huff and Richard Huff. His father served as a military judge and was one of the four recipients of the President's Distinguished Service Award for his distinguished service as a judge on the District Court of the Western District of Arizona. He also served as a judge on the Central District Court of Arizona.  Judge David's father served as the district court judge for much of the 1960s and 1970s, but David attended Scottsdale Junior College, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1975 and his law degree in 1978.

As we go through this process that we have now this year we are having the American people think that America is the only country that does not have a plan that is actually going to work because what we are doing is we are not actually factoring in the realities of what the future is going to look like in this country.  When I think about the history of this country, I think about a lot of things, but I think about the most important thing is our founding. It was a country that was founded on the principles of the Constitution, and it was a country that was founded on a set of principles that, at least in the founding documents, laid out the basic parameters of our government.

I thank the gentleman for his comments. Again, I am somewhat amazed and chagrined that the Speaker would find the time to use the majority to block the passage of a highway extension connecting New Jersey to Washington, DC.  In the Committee on Appropriations last week, the Speaker said, ``There is nothing in this bill that would authorize a highway project from New Jersey to Washington, DC.'' That is an astounding statement by the Speaker. The New Jersey Turnpike is the only bridge in New Jersey that crosses the Delaware River. The New Jersey Turnpike is the only national transportation system that runs through the heart of New Jersey, and we cannot build a national highway from New Jersey to Washington, DC. That is simply not possible.  I thank the gentleman for his comments.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I'm proud to have joined the Progressive Caucus here today to call on the Trump administration to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act and return to the work of creating jobs and creating jobs.  There is a reason the Republican majority and President Trump have been unable to create jobs in the last 3 years, and that's because they've been unwilling to work with Democrats on issues like healthcare and taxes. The administration has spent $6.4 trillion since taking office. They've given over $5.7 trillion in tax breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. And they've created an

We discovered that Saddam was hiding, hiding in the snow.  Two years later, on March 21, 2003, in Baghdad, the United States soldiers found Saddam again, in his dark bunkers. Saddam had just fired a rocket at a U.S. military base.  But the reason for the renewed action was not the behavior of Saddam Hussein, but rather the behavior of a failed government in Iraq, a failed military, and a failed national security policy. Saddam Hussein had refused to abide by a negotiated settlement to end the civil war in Iraq, a peace which he had signed with the Shiite majority in Iraq.

Mr. President, I support the intent of the amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama. President Clinton has stated his support for a study on the possible impact on our Internet service providers online, and I would like to be a part of that study to understand what the universe of broadband users in this country will be in the future.  The FCC currently has a structure that has created a de facto monopoly in the marketplace. I think the Commission's power to regulate the Internet is severely eroded by this de facto monopoly. The FCC has interpreted this power to effectively mandate any content that they issue to a broadband provider.  For instance, in July of 2005, the FCC adopted a very broad interpretation of the definition of ``public utility'' in the 1934 Communications Act to allow the Commission to mandate the deployment of broadband service to any public interest entity.

Mr. Chairman, in the coming years, we will begin to see the emergence of a new and innovative educational profession, the professional and technical teacher. It is my understanding that the field of teaching has become more and more competitive as we age and experience more and more educational challenges.  The rising cost of education is a significant factor, as is the declining number of teaching jobs.

Mr. President, yesterday FBI agents, at the direction of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the president of the New York State Attorney General all came to the rule number of referral, number five. That was a recent resolution.  We have not had that since the Senator from Illinois introduced the resolution. That is the reason why I brought this amendment. We had some very interesting conversations with the U.S. attorneys about it. The distinguished assistant U.S. attorney, who is a prosecutor, said: I think the amendment is very important.  The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said: Yes, that is the one that is pending. He did not say the other one was not pending.

Violence is one of the most pressing problems facing our country. The crime rate in the United States is at an all-time high. Since the 1960's, violent crime has risen by 1,038 percent. In 1992, more than 12,000 murders occurred in the United States, the most in 25 years.  In the past few years, Congress has taken a number of steps to address this serious problem. The 1994 crime bill has been one of the most successful in our Nation's history. The bill contains several provisions which will help combat the growing problem of crime. It includes

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to a living legend: my friend and Vietnam veteran and United States Navy pilot CPT Fred E. McGraw.  During the Vietnam War, his service to the United States Navy was extensive. He served in the Archive of Operations in Washington, DC, the Army Air Force Command and Staff College, the Pacific Command, the Department of Defense Inspector General, and was stationed in Vietnam. He was deployed to Panama in 1967, where he served with the Pacific Air National Guard and later was assigned to the Vietnam theater. He served his country admirably.  On May 1, 1980, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty. Fred E. McGraw is a true hero and an example of American values.

The question that I ask of the chairman of the committee is, is it the proper thing to do to have the subcommittee chairman come down here and make an announcement that there is a problem? The problem is that the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget, a gentleman who has not run a major corporation in his life, who has never been on the Board of Directors of a major corporation, has decided to talk about a problem that is not a problem.  Now, the problem is that, in the gentleman's own words, he has decided that this is a real problem. This is a real problem, and the problem is that the chairman of the committee

Mr. President, I will be brief. I say that the likelihood of the nuclear threat of Iran to the nuclear capability of the United States is so very very real that President Obama should make a very clear statement and not engage in more rhetoric. It is more sophisticated than rhetoric. It is not just an issue of the Middle East, it is a national security issue.  In fact, the Middle East is a theater, and Iran has no interest in engaging in any activity. It has no interest in expanding its influence in the Middle East.  It has been my understanding that the Iranians were in Iraq. They are in the Balkans. They are in Syria. They are in Lebanon. They are in Egypt. They are in Pakistan. They are in the Sinai. They are in the Sinai, and they have no interest in opening up

PFAS is a very serious problem, and we need to act.  The PFAS bill we have before us today, the PFAS Amendments Act of 2016, has strong bipartisan support, and I commend Chairman Walden and the ranking member, Mr. Calvert, for their work on this bill.  The bill will provide $25 million in CDC's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and PFAS Resource Education, and it will enhance the ability of CDC to carry out research on PFAS and its health effects.  This bill requires CDC to increase its oversight of PFAS chemicals and its partnerships with other Federal agencies and private industry to help

The USDA's nutritional program was first established in the 1940's to provide nutritious meals to low-income children in urban areas. Today, this program provides nutritious meals to the children of rural and underserved areas of our country.  In my home State of Illinois, there are approximately 8,000 children in this program, and over 15,000 meals are provided every week to needy children.

Mr. Chairman, I have been a member of the Committee on the Budget when we have debated this issue in the House and have voted on this issue in the process of debate in the House and the Senate and have been very much opposed to reforms in Medicare, to make changes to Medicare.  The first time we had a debate on this issue in the House of Representatives, I was the first person in the country to introduce a bill on Medicare that would have guaranteed that people would be able to get coverage if they liked it, and we were on a roll in the House, and this was the first time that the House of Representatives had voted on a piece of legislation that guaranteed that you would have the same coverage for your senior citizens that you would have in your State.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 weeks the Taiwanese people have been under siege by military forces from the People's Republic of China who have been in and around Taiwan since March of last year when they took over that policy of the People's Republic of China that they had been following since the days of the days when they had been in the last weeks of the 20th century.  It has been the longest occupation in the history of the People's Republic of China. They have destroyed over 1,000 Taiwanese businesses and property and killed over 30,000 people. It is time that the People's Republic of China stop its occupation of Taiwan and get their people back home.

The Times quotes General Petraeus as acknowledging ``longstanding ties between Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence'' and Afghan intelligence operatives and Taliban commanders. It continues: The alliance is also important to Pakistan's security interests, including the U.S. goal of preventing the growth of a resurgent Taliban.  Pakistan has a long and troubled relationship with the Taliban. The militant group controls a number of provinces and now controls a large part of the country. The Taliban's brutal rule and intimidation of its own people have been devastating to the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban has repeatedly tried to exploit these recent developments for their own personal gain.  The Times notes that the United States and Pakistan continue to exchange information on terrorists in Afghanistan and the terror group's operatives in Pakistan. It notes that the relationship has improved since the Taliban was ousted from power in 2001

Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from North Carolina has made the case more eloquently than I have in this Congress on the regular order of the House of Representatives and in this town about the American North.  We need to remember that when the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution of the United States, they did not set up a system where the only way for people to have a voice was to be represented by the representation of their local communities. We need to remember that the citizens of our great Nation have had that voice for many, many years.  So I would like to remind my colleagues of the role of our local communities and the role of our State and local communities in this institution. And I would ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the nomination of Mr. Thomas Jefferson, the rightful President of the United States, and for the consideration

Mr. Chairman, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 upholds the promise made in 1776 that equal voting rights would guarantee that all citizens would have the right to vote. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court decision upholding the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder has had an adverse impact on this promise. The decision in Shelby County v. Holder held that racial discrimination in voting was not a legitimate basis for a local government's compliance with the Voting Rights Act. In other words, the Voting Rights Act will not protect all citizens from discrimination in voting, but only those who are illegally prevented from voting. The impact of the Shelby County decision is not limited to the Voting Rights Act. The court's decision is a direct attack on the rights of American citizens who are denied the right to vote based on race.  Now, it is true that some States

This is happening in the areas of inner-city Philadelphia, and it is happening throughout the country.  It is time for the Federal Government to do something. It is time to act.

Mr. President, I await, sometimes with trepidation, the annual report of my good friend from the great State of New York Bill Bishop from his year in the House of Representatives. This annual report is a masterful work of humor, irony, and its not always surprising, but certainly always instructive work, about our Nation's history and the issues that are before us.  This year's report from Bill Bishop's staff is titled ``A Good Life.'' It is a good life. Bill Bishop's staff has had to endure many years of Senatorial fatigue. They have had to have an open ear, they have had to listen to the truth and facts of our country's history.  The good news is that Bill Bishop's staff, at least from his point of view, has been largely ignored by the Senate in the last several years

Mr. President, in the early 1950s, at a time when political backrooms were still smoke-filled and back-alley backroom deals were still early on the President's agenda, I was very impressed with the Senator from Iowa, who, after serving in the Senate for 8 years, and had been Governor of the State of Iowa for 2 years, decided to run for President.  At the time, he was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. I remember being encouraged by the Senator from Iowa, and by his outstanding work as Governor of the State of Iowa, that he would have an opportunity to run for President.

I oppose the Reid amendment because I believe that it would, in fact, endanger the safety of American troops and other U.S. interests in Haiti.  The bill we are considering would provide $5 million for the Haitian security forces. It provides for the transfer of U.S. troops to Haiti in the event of a military coup, but, as Senator Biden pointed out, that bill provides no additional funds for Haiti.

Under the Affordable Care Act, all health plans must cover a minimum of 30 essential benefits, including maternity care, prescription drugs, mental health, and family planning. This means that if you have a preexisting condition, you cannot get insurance.  However, many of these plans do not cover maternity care. In fact, if you are not able to get maternity care, you will be left with the uninsured. And even if you are covered, it may not be covered if you get pregnant.

Mr. Speaker, there is an issue of critical concern to the human rights movement around the world and critical concern to South Africa. The recent incident in Ethiopia and the brutal crackdown on peaceful activists there, not only make clear that human rights violations and repression in Ethiopia are unacceptable, but also serve as a stark reminder that the global demand for democracy and the right to freedom of expression are not free from attack and are often met with the harshest human rights and anti-American regimes.  These issues of fundamental concern are also ones which can be addressed without necessarily resorting to unilateral action by the United States. The unilateralist policy of using military force against the regime of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela has been a shameful policy for the United States. It is also unacceptable for the United States to be engaged in a diplomatic policy that undermines the freedom of

The legislation that has been introduced by the Senator from Utah would take a very long time to complete, but I think we ought to give it time.  I am very concerned that it does not take

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here today on this day and Speaker Gingrich calendar.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the conference report on H.R. 1577, the ``Health Insurance Reform and Affordability Act of 1994.'' I was proud to have worked with the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] to develop this compromise. This bill will help millions of Americans and, importantly, it will make health care more affordable for millions more.  Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated, this legislation is a step in the right direction toward addressing the issue of rising health care costs. I believe that the health insurance reforms of the 104th Congress are an important

I have had the good fortune to have the boys here and have been able to watch the work of Senator Reid and Senator Dole and Senator Bingaman and Senator Roth, the members of the HELP Committee, and all the other Members of this body working to bring this forward. It is a very bipartisan bill.  I would like to thank Senator Reid, who I know has done a great job in working on this legislation, Senator McCain, Senator Bingaman, Senator Dole, and Senator Roth.

We have been fighting for months to free Saddam Hussein and his regime from their clutches. There has been a great deal of bloodshed and a great deal of bloodshed. In fact, we have seen that there have been tremendous human rights abuses perpetrated by the Iraqi regime, including execution, torture, rape, and murder.  We have had reports of snipers taking aim at innocent civilians and innocent American soldiers. The Iraqi people are expressing their outrage over these violations of their basic human rights.

Madam Speaker, today, the House will, once again, vote to restrict access to our reproductive health coverage for millions of Americans because they pay higher premiums for their health care than equal-sized employees.  The Affordable Care Act is good for women, for the economy, and for the country. Unfortunately, we have been unable to pass a health care reform bill that is more than a gimmick. Instead of fixing the problems with our current health care system, the President's Republican allies have decided to expand and privatize Medicare, jeopardizing coverage for over 12 million Americans.  The only thing more damaging than a bill to expand and privatize Medicare is a bill to ration health care for Americans.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Credit reports provide valuable information about our personal financial history, making it easy for consumers to determine if they are eligible for credit. In addition, the reports help consumers better understand the credit opportunities available to them. Consumers should be able to know how they will repay their credit card debt if their credit report shows that they are delinquent on their payments. Unfortunately, too many people today are unwilling to submit accurate credit reports to credit bureaus and instead only provide inaccurate information.

That is a good policy. I think that is the way it ought to be.

Mr. President, for nearly 16 years, Senator Mark Kirk has given voice to his Illinois constituents in this effort to provide affordable health care to all of our citizens. Mark has been a strong advocate for health care reform and employment.  When he first ran for Congress in 2004, Mark was widely regarded as the most popular Member of the U.S. Senate. That year, voters also elected him to the Illinois State Senate. Mark's record as a Member of Congress was punctuated by three consecutive terms as a Republican. As a Republican, he worked to strengthen Medicare and Social Security and promote a free market economy.  Mark Kirk's record in the Illinois Senate was a strong example for us all.

In recent years, the Murray office has served as a leader in the community in its support of career and technical education, and has been a catalyst for local growth and development. The center's impressive growth has been directly related to its role as a community development block grant that has allowed it to expand and serve all of the Murray community.  The Center is part of a multi-pronged effort to ensure that our Nation's children have the opportunity to achieve the American dream.

Madam Speaker, America's intervention in Libya was initially based on the international community's ``Responsibility to Protect International Peace and Security'' doctrine agreed upon in October of 2002.
