So, today I want to address the Members of this House. It is our responsibility to protect our people. It is our responsibility to make sure that our people are protected. It is our responsibility to make sure that our people are safe.  That is why I am proud to say

Many of these farms are rural and in some cases, in fact, are privately owned.  For instance, in Montana, if you are a member of the Soybean Research Council, you are eligible to participate in the New America Nutrition program. That is the program that is designed to assist low-income people to learn the ways of agriculture.  The average cost of that program in Montana is $7,500 a year. The price tag for the New

I rise in strong support of H.R. 5877, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005.

In 2008, the State of Colorado alone released 14 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere.  Our legislation would take a small step toward reducing the problem. We would not require drilling or fracking in the Outer Continental Shelf, which would only put more methane into the atmosphere. Instead, we would require drilling and fracking in areas that already have proven to be safe.  We also should be focusing on increasing the use of renewable energy.

Mr. Speaker Congress considered Chairman Walker's proposed plan to eliminate the three largest agencies in our Federal Government.

I do so because I believe that this action is a good first step toward returning the forest health to a healthier condition. However, as my colleagues know, it is far from sufficient.  As my colleagues know, we have passed bills which provide $6 billion in tax cuts for the rich, but we are currently in the process of reforming the IRS.

Mr. Speaker, Nielsen samples are absolutely useless. Nielsen has been around for a long time. I remember watching the Soviet Union during the Cold War and how they had a system that would bring the data back to the United States to get the best measurement possible. Nielsen sampling is the only reliable way of assessing and judging the popularity of a show or a movie.  The interesting thing is that when I say that I want the government to control what we watch on television, the problem is that I don't want the government to control what we watch on television. I don't want the government to be in charge of deciding what shows are popular and what shows

This is not about overtime. It is about protecting the jobs of Americans.  This bill is a bipartisan effort to protect American jobs, but it is not only about protecting jobs.

Mr. Speaker today forces security forces to participate in self-defence, often at great risk to themselves. The consequences of this system are serious. The man who took the gun away from his friend is likely to kill someone else.  The overwhelming majority of self-defense fatalities occur when there is no other way of protecting themselves, and the overwhelming majority of self-defense deaths are among the youngest, with young people at the greatest risk.  One of the reasons this system has failed to protect the American people is that it has been, for far too long, poorly enforced. We need to address this issue.  The self-defense bill that

Mr. Speaker class democratic Americans are having a real problem with the Bush administration. We have a President that was elected with the people's choice, but instead of using that to implement his vision for America, he is doing everything he can to kill it.  He has sent the military to Bosnia, he has set up a new agency to control the economy, he has raised taxes, and now he wants to try to force the American people to buy more oil from OPEC.  But most importantly, he is a dictator. He does not want the American people to know what is happening to our economy, to our national security, and to our environment.

Mr. Speaker Speaker, abuse awareness is a scourge on the world. It is one of the most pervasive and pernicious forms of violence in the world today.  Violence against women is a threat to all countries and communities. We must all stand together to fight this crime. We must take every step to protect the rights of all women, regardless of where they live or how they are treated.  We must also take every step to prevent violence against women and girls and all women from being in any way considered a crime.  But we cannot continue to fight this scourge if we are not willing to confront it head-on. That is why I

Mr. President years ago Planned Parenthood Kirkland Clinic in Seattle, WA, became the first of the Federal Government's nine abortion clinics to shut down. It was an early indication that the radical right would soon be seizing upon this Congress to repeal the Hyde amendment, which prevents the use of Federal funds to pay for abortions.  That kind of legislation has no place in this Congress, nor in this country. The right to abortion is a fundamental human right, and I do not believe it should be used as a political tool. The Hyde amendment should be repealed, and Congress should return to the pre-1960s law.  That is why I am pleased
