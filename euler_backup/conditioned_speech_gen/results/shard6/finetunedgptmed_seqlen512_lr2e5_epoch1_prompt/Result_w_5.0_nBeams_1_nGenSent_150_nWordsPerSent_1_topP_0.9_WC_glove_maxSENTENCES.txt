Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. I hope that after I speak for a minute on this that we will then take it up with the two leaders and have a debate about this matter and if we come back to it again next week after I get back to Washington, we will have it back here on the House floor and it would be a much more important issue and I think very important to this country that we address now and we will be able to debate it tomorrow and we will have the debate now and we will be able to have the debate over the next weeks and months and years to come on this matter as we go about the work of the House of Representatives that will determine how it will be able to spend money to provide more for education in this country so that we can have the best and the brightest who

So do you get, my colleagues, the hypocrisy? They slashed the tax collectors, paid eight armed Federal employees to go into drug courts where people are not doing drugs, there were not eight private prisoners who had to have their hands tied, there were not eight Federal employees on the ground assisting the drug courts. They slashed the drug courts. The rationale for it is we want you to go out of business. So, it is an effort to eliminate the work force, and that is what is done.   twenties billion dollars for the death penalty and those facts are sort of cliched. They got a trial. They did not even have witnesses who could testify against the defendant.

Mr. President, the smoke is housing crisis foreclosures. The fire is the general economy because of the massive overregulation of the economy that we see around us. We need legislation to address those major issues that require legislation and that need us to address in the legislation that comes out of this Senate and the legislation that comes out of the House of Representatives and the legislation that comes out of the White House. But there is no general economy that we need to address that is as bad as the housing crisis that is going on and the recession that is going on and the lack of economic opportunity that is going on in this country.  I voted for President Obama's bill. I feel good about that. It addressed the foreclosure crisis, I said then, as was evident from my vote. I believe it is a step in the right direction. But

Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by simply expressing my appreciation to the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this important measure.  First, I want to acknowledge that this bipartisan measure provides the opportunity for important investments in education for all Americans. I have always advocated that we invest more in the classroom so that our children can become better prepared for the jobs that lie ahead. Because as we all know, students drop out if they do not receive the support and the guidance to learn and grow up.  As I indicated yesterday, this legislation contains two very important provisions that will make the most impact for our children and for our communities in the months ahead. They are important because they increase the competitiveness and economic prosperity of our Nation. They are important because they provide financial incentives

Mr. Speaker, the gloom, doom, and depressed say the economy is in trouble. The naysayer's gloom and doom turn out to be more fallacious than their half-truth. Yes, the economy is in trouble. But it can be recovered.  The President claims that his deficit spending plan would ``bring us back into the family wage growth of the late 1980's.'' But as the chart at the end of this particular article shows, his proposed plan would have us spend over $700 billion just to keep up with the dollar's recent $8.9-plus trillion current account deficit, even as the current account is expected to reach $9.4 trillion by the end of the decade and more than double to $11 trillion by the end of the next century. And that's just to keep up with the dollar.  Mr. Speaker

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I listened to my friend from Georgia on the point that this has been one of the most expensive congressional hearings ever held in the House of Representatives. It is not only a more expensive hearing because we have to spend more time on this because it takes more time to explain to the American people what a $30 billion weapons system is and how it can break down in the environment where it will make it virtually impossible to stop its development and to deliver it and get rid of it when it is going to explode. So if we do not have the Congressional Budget Office telling us what the cost is of this bill that was introduced by my good friend from Georgia, this bill will get much more votes than it has votes.

Most of us know that we are going to have a long month here this week as the Congress is in a very serious situation of a partial government shutdown.

Most of us who have been on the committees have been very deeply troubled because that is one of the fundamental responsibilities of the Congress of the United States of America.

Mr. President, over the last many months millions of Americans have signed up for affordable health care benefits that they thought they could never afford. The new marketplace health insurance plans are a step in the right direction in our efforts to bring down the cost of health care for American families and communities. But they are a product of compromise on all sides of the issue. We have spent much of the last year or so working with House Republicans in putting together a comprehensive reform proposal that reflects real need and real value for America's families and businesses that must be fixed as quickly as possible if we are to get the job done. We have also focused our efforts on true price fixing and ensuring that those who are making health care choices with affordable insurance policies will know that there will be some health care coverage that they have been promised and that they can count

Mr. Speaker, the American public strongly favors banning gifts from lobbyists to Members of Congress, but many Members of Congress have become actively involved in lobbying as their first-hand experience teaches them how to conduct themselves in a quiet but effective manner. The Federal Government has a responsibility to make sure that Members and staff Members do not take advantage of this opportunity to set their policy through the control of their own funds or to receive their own taxpayer-funded salary from the government. This has long been the responsibility of Congress and the Congress should not continue to embrace and support legislation that abuses this responsibility. A new leadership in the House must ensure that we continue to make sure that Congress is elected with a high degree of public trust and is a place where the rights of all Americans are recognized and respected.

Mr. Speaker, President Clinton, in his recent State of the Union Address proposed another Federal Government program for the State of California that will drive up the cost of all education in California. The most egregious of those are the federal grant programs that award lifetime merit scholarship to upper-income students who are in all other modes of education below a college degree. This grants leverage by the Federal Government on the backs of public schools and taxpayers.  In 1995, California school system had enrollment numbers of over 32,000. Last year, California teacher retention rates were at 4 percent. While we have an increasing number of students from rural and urban areas who want to attend the schools that California currently has, it is not enough to remain competitive.

Second, it will provide an independent medical assessment for the Veterans Home Health and a chance for the VA to increase its efforts to be competitive in providing quality medical care for its veterans in accordance

I believe it is a first step in ensuring that those children who are victims of sexual abuse will not be abandoned in the children's hospital without caring adults involved.  There are about 100 sexual crimes reported to child welfare services each year in the United States. Children are the most likely victims of child sexual abuse. This is true for both boys and girls. Boys and girls who are sexually abused can be coerced into sex by predators who know that they cannot report the abuse to a local child welfare agency and will not be able to get help there if they try to do so for themselves. Most of the time they will be forced into prostitution or even forced into backroom sex acts by the perpetrators and will be put in harm's way or even forced to go

Madam Chair, this amendment was going to be offered by Mr. Markey, and he strongly supports this EPA ban because it would reduce carbon pollution in the environment, decrease greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and reduce carbon emissions from transportation sources that cause serious air pollution.  I just saw on that well today that a poll showed that 87 percent of the American people are in favor of clean, renewable sources of energy that will create more jobs. And then a Washington Post article, April 10, one of my favorite parts, entitled ``Four years in the making, BP Deepwater Horizon's Deepwater Horizon is at it again'' shows that oil is flooding the gulf coast.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If you look at this Congress that Republicans have had over the years now as opposed to Democratic Congresses with Democrat Presidents, President Clinton was in the White House in the last 2 years of the Democratic Congress before Republicans got elected and he has spent the last 2 years pursuing those tax

I also strongly support the concurrent resolution of ratification for Poland. Poland has been an important part of NATO and should be included in NATO. Poland represents one of the many Eastern European countries which should also be included in NATO. Poland continues to play a central role in NATO. Romania and Bulgaria are NATO members and Romania and Bulgaria have contributed greatly to the stability of NATO in recent years. Poland also currently leads NATO efforts to defend Turkey.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Affairs Health Care Committee bill.  Veterans must be assured that no veteran who has served our country will be required to wait months in order to seek medical attention because Congress does not mandate wait times or reimbursement.  There have been many areas of disrepair and neglect in the VA health care system and it is a disgrace that this care is not being provided to the veterans who need it.  H.R. 840 is the first bill to fully fund veterans health care and continue improving the health care system.  Instead of cutting medical care, H.R. 840 allows VA to expand care services to veterans living in other States.  I am disappointed that President Clinton proposed a $14 billion increase for veterans health care, but it is my hope that

Mr. Speaker, after decades of Washington irresponsibility, Americans are facing nearly $17 trillion of debt and still waiting to see a national health care reform plan to save Medicare from bankruptcy. Washington Democrats want to force American citizens to live in fear that their doctors and hospitals will be left standing empty as long as Americans continue to accept out-of-control prescription drug prices and congressional inaction on health care reform. Despite the best efforts of Democrats and the Obama administration, much of our Nation remains woefully underinsured or uninsured. More than 2 million Americans remain without insurance coverage and over 5 million people lack health insurance altogether.

Mr. President, I mentioned the AARP and their opposition to this amendment. There is an organization that has a history of being the most serious and effective lobby group in Washington. The American Association of Retired Persons, AARP is a fiscal watchdog organization whose members call on Congress to make certain that their benefits program is not funded without adequate funds to ensure its critical mission of protection of senior citizens and families from Medicare cuts to Medicare Part D, particularly in areas of debt such as construction. The current year debt and deficit for Congress was $2 billion, rising to $9.3 billion this year and just as it is on pace to reach $22 billion.  The current deficit for this fiscal year is projected to total $58.7 billion, a 37 percent increase over the fiscal year 2009. There are no easy solutions to the budget

Mr. President, on July 26, I introduced critical legislation to stem the rising tide of millions of Americans who are once again subject to years of Federal financial regulation under the Troubled Asset Relief Program--TARP--or ``TARP-A''. I am pleased to say Congress is now taking action to combat this growing problem with the Community Reinvestment Act of 2009. This legislation will allow communities and the Federal Government to collectively protect taxpayers from the cost of the government's economic policies and agencies against future liability for failing to adhere to Federal financial standards for the first time in a decade.  Every Member of Congress should be aware that in 2009, more than 14 million Americans will experience the imposition of additional restrictions on their financial liberty that are out of line with the rights they have fought so hard for and against throughout their fighting careers.

Mr. Chairman, since 1965, when the ESEA was passed, we have gone from chalkboards to full-fledged congressional hearings with witnesses testifying before the House Committee on the Judiciary, Congress, the Secretary of State, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the President of the United States and the Congressional Research Service. This requires extensive preparation and analysis of the various aspects of the administration's review of environmental legislation. I think we have learned some interesting things about the threat from the House Republican side of the aisle to environmental legislation.  We learned something interesting today that is useful as an example of how those who say they do not want environmental legislation now oppose it. They now want to include a provision that would have made it a Federal crime to communicate their own personal views about and comments about a local, State or Federal law that would affect an environmental issue

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Indeed, this would be a $20 billion cut from the bill in 1995 and $90 billion in 1997 and more than $2 billion over 5 years in the years 1995 through 1999 alone. All this to pay for more than $3 billion of tax breaks for the wealthy, $2 billion of which would go to the top one-tenth of 1 percent of income earners in America over the next decade.  According to the Committee on Ways and Means last year, on average households with incomes over $100,000 will receive $27,000 in additional taxes under the tax cut program over a 5-year period.

First and foremost, this proposal would not even allow Congress to actually take any of the billions of dollars that are currently being spent on military assistance without actually showing that some element of spending is actually being used and effectively paying for it. That would not even be fair because the policy of this Congress, and this President and his administration for that matter, is to somehow justify the enormous new burden of debt that is being imposed on American citizens

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Washington for yielding time to me. And I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York for her great work on this bill, to the chair of the Committee on Rules for not only working with the Rules Committee to make sure that this kind of an important bill can be brought to the floor of the House of Representatives and signed into law, but I want to also take a moment and say that I did not agree with much of what you were going to do last year when you brought this bill to the floor of the House of Representatives and the President of the United States said he did not think we should go back to the days when we could even close our eyes to this problem and think that it could even be possible to have a child be born with this kind of a birth defect

But this notion of holding one bill in your left hand and another bill in your right hand that would block everything else but this bill is wholly different from our State of Vermont trying to address this problem and be a major player in addressing it.  The difference is that our Governor vetoed the bill that is being discussed now but that is on our desk now on the floor of the House of Representatives and it makes no difference to anyone who is participating in this business to the extent that it is a closed rule today. But if you like something, you can go to the right here on the floor of the House of Representatives and you can take a look at it. You can go back and tell your Governor that you want a special program or you want a different focus of dealing with your particular problem and perhaps there are some other more

Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Schumer in offering legislation that will help maintain and strengthen our Nation's housing and community resources. For the past 16 years, the public housing trust fund has been the engine of American social policy, providing funds to states to operate public housing and community development agencies. Today, some of the most successful public housing authorities are operating under a Commission on Oversight and Administration, or COPE, designed to review agency policies, investigate administrative, management, or personnel issues, and assess its effectiveness. One of the COPE's primary functions is oversight of the operating budget, which is funded through additional Federal funds that Congress has approved.  Two of the most frequently cited problems with public housing include higher than average maintenance costs and overcrowding. The Senate bill before the Senate would transfer $13 million of the total $

It is, in some respects, deja vu all over again. It is dangerous for government agencies and lawyers to try to intervene in the way that they do today because the Justice Department now is on notice that it will soon be able to raise class action lawsuits with criminal purposes. If a lawyer in a particular class action can use what is called a ``joint utility procedure,'' which means that they are trying to sell together a small business and each one is a separate and distinct business, what you have here is what is called a bar. It has a small group that is saying there are violations, and they are making that claim with a big group and they are putting them together so that they can bring them all together. And that is what is going to get these people off the hook if these lawyers can take that bar as a case

As a matter of fact, the House Parliamentarian said it was outside the scope of the rule to have any amendments in order to these bills if they have been introduced or taken up. And if you are introducing a bill with a ``Read the Bill Now'' amendment, that clearly requires that there have been at least 50 of them passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning that your first amendment would be to read the bill to the States.  But if you are doing it in the way the House of Representatives has done it before, with an alternative minimum tax, as the gentlewoman has just described it, you would need more than 50 amendments and you would be subject to a 30-day investigation by the Committee on Rules. That does not in any way constitute a substantive amendment. It is kind of an alternative

I cannot understand what the purpose of a one-half of one-third of the Republicans on this vote would be except for trying to force through and force through a key bill for which Republicans are absolutely opposed and with which they do not even support

But what this bill does is it has gone a little too far and it has taken what we did as a nation and that is in the civil service system to a new level of stupid, and that is making the civil service system as stupid as it has ever been before because this bill has the poor policy of making this country less safe as a result of this bill.

Madam Speaker, yesterday Virginia District Court Judge Henry Hudson's decision striking down one provision of the Affordable Care Act was a major blow to the health insurance markets in this country. This decision has many implications not only for how plans will have to offer their plans in some parts of the country, but will also have significant consequences for the access to quality health insurance for Americans who currently have no insurance.  A college student is more likely to get sick or even die from asthma when they are at risk than a coal miner is likely to be for coal-related accidents. This is especially true when one is living paycheck to paycheck. In addition, this decision will lead to higher rates for medical insurance for health plans in States that do not have health insurance requirements. It will likely mean insurers cannot offer health insurance to more than half of Americans. The

The Democrats on the other side of the aisle were saying that we need to increase the Medicare program. And I got to see a congressional hearing, and I said, ``Well, how much more would you like the program to grow without the reform and the changes that you have promised on that issue of Medicare being covered by these plans? How much more would you like us to provide for that increase in their purchasing power when it does not take effect until April 30, 2000.'' And I would like to remember now and the rest of the time that the majority leader was asking this question. It is a clear way that the Democrats want to increase the eligibility age

It is not a long period of time that is going to pass before we get out of Iraq so that we can take another chance to improve that country.

But when we take from the States the money that they do have to make this tax go up and then we send it to Washington to be used for other purposes--for example, to make sure it is not spent on somebody else's problem--when we take this money from the States the money we have to use for our other purposes is now going to Washington and being sent to States that have the least in need for their people, not the most.

The bottom line of it is that the administration says we are going to increase costs of health care by 20 percent for our veterans who are participating in the National Guard and Reserve.  The Clinton administration says this will save veterans over $100 million in the first year and it is not going to cost the Federal Government a penny for the next 5 years. I will say for the record that the Republicans say they are not interested in forcing the Federal Government to pay for health care for the poor veterans who come through their college or trade schools or apprenticeship

Mr. President, I introduce the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement Act of 1996. This bill would give Federal law enforcement the necessary tools to enforce Federal criminal laws against those who commit the worst of our Nation's criminal offenses. It would authorize the District of Columbia to adopt certain laws in order to control illegal immigration by creating a high-tech superhighway that would link the Nation's most dangerous regions to law enforcement of the District. It would also authorize the federal government to act as the first response to the crisis of illegal immigration that has destroyed American families and strained the already stretched budget.  Illegal immigration threatens the very fabric of our Nation's society. It can destroy American families and threaten our international standing and development. The Federal Government and the District of Columbia share a common interest in solving this problem. They must work together to stop illegal immigration

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment because I believe that American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill to train foreign pilots. Unfortunately, I believe that some Members of Congress think that if our law allows them to sell our military aircraft, that we should be able to profit from that sale. Therefore, I want to focus my amendment on the fact that this amendment will not apply to the selling of our foreign Government aircraft or cargo that we need at all. Instead, this amendment would apply to our dollars we use overseas to pay for our military expenditures. I believe that if we adopt this amendment that we should end our taxpayer subsidized military projects. This is not a politically motivated amendment but I believe that we should follow the same logic that we used when we started paying for our foreign construction programs instead of paying our way

This amendment would provide funds for the Safe and Accountable Schools program and to hire more school personnel to program in our Nation's rural school districts to enhance the education of students in our schools and to help ensure the learning environments are not broken down by technology.

Many of these programs are based on evidence-based sexual health, sexually transmitted disease prevention, and first-time sex education programs.

That is not what this amendment is all about. The $245 billion cut is about $1 billion more for children that would have to be taken from programs for their education and health care than for those same children that do not need the tax cut.  Let us say this. The $245 billion tax cut that has been projected to come from this tax cut that will come to us is $1 billion more than we spend on children's health care and $1 billion

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the continuing resolution to fund our Government and pay our Nation's bills and to honor our Nation's heroes, including those in the U.S. Armed Forces who have given so much in the name of freedom. And I urge the Senate to approve the conference agreement as amended, and to act promptly to provide our troops with the necessary funding to continue to protect our freedom in the face of aggression on a scale never before seen by any nation in the history of the world.  During the course of this conflict, and because of the sacrifices made by our Armed Forces throughout this conflict and those already who have given their lives to protect us, we have added nearly $31 billion to the level of spending on the war against Iraq. This resolution, as amended, provides almost $4 billion

Mr. President, I believe that both the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Massachusetts are correct. Senators in general can only hope that their legislation that they are working on will not be overbroad in the fact that the United States will always look after its interests in a particular area, the Nation's interests, but that if it is broadly applied, that the Federal Government, at least in this legislation, could be taken over and have certain teeth and certain limitations to it. If we make that a fact, if we say that this has to be broad application in order to be broad in that area, then of course we will not be able to apply it universally and apply it across a country because that is the nature of the American system of government.

This measure would also authorize the President to require the Secretary of State to prepare a policy to assist foreign governments and individuals in the collection and management of U.S. collection and handling of their waste and a database of U.S. certification or registration of countries of origin

Mr. President, I will be brief. I say that the likelihood of the nuclear threat to be addressed by President Bush and by the Nuclear Posture Review Board is relatively low. Most certainly it is low. The intelligence community would have a very difficult time monitoring it if we did not have the tools we have in place, and they are very sophisticated tools, so they would not have a great deal of credibility with regard to the American people.  So I would like to use this opportunity as I proceed through this debate to point out that the country has not benefited greatly from the Government's involvement in this program in the form of the economic bonus, for a number of reasons.  Number one, the intelligence community is not protected by the one-time payment and the safeguards provided by the concept of security. For the most part they operate

We can probably do a better job than we did when Congress was considering the highway bill in 1976 when we had nearly a billion dollars in Federal subsidies going to the States to build highways and so we could determine what they would do. That does not make sense, and we should have an inspector general to do it.

I believe you have said what I say almost one-third of the time this evening, but I want to put your comments into the record because you say that your proposal puts the government on a path to Page S 16474]]a balanced budget at a time when you have spent almost the last 11 years proposing a 6-year plan to reduce the size of government and balance the budget. You also mentioned that there has been a decrease in government spending. Does that not concern you as much as people say that your proposal will force the Federal Government to cut back on programs that will certainly reduce government spending at the very time that we are on the verge of that 6-year plan

First of all, I should point out to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania that there are many people in America that do not have health insurance. They are working long hours with a health care system that is so poor that they cannot afford health insurance and so if they are only going to be part of the working population in America for one year and are well enough in the rest of their lives that their only insurance they have is at their job, they would be right at a health care system in America that could give them health care and other coverage in that period of time that they have not had health insurance in the past and then had an opportunity to have the health care coverage that they had in the first year that they had health insurance in the country and that they now have to choose between it and what they had in the first year

Mr. Speaker, on the morning of September 11, 2001, nearly 3,000 innocent men, women, and children were killed on that August day in the United States of America by terrorists and the militant extremists of the terrorists who attacked New York City on September 11, 2001. Many of the victims were their families. They lost their husbands, wives, parents, children, and friends on that horrific attack on that precious day, September 11, 2001.  When President Bush came to office in January of 2001, he pledged to clean up our security infrastructure and our homeland security programs, and he had a clear goal to take on terrorists and those who would attack our way of life in America.  In the year since, the American people have seen our Nation weaken and become safer, but terrorists have hijacked our security infrastructure, and America has weakened as a Nation.

The Federal Government has no control over Medicare reimbursement because we have not passed this amendment on to the States that would mandate that in general the Medicare reimbursement for physicians, hospitals and other providers of health care services must be established to the Federal Government.

The people were told that the law would make the health care system better for them and that it would make their financial decisions better so that they could keep more of what they make. And then we have the big idea that health care reform can only be made better by using government power to make it better.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H. Res. 432, condemning the attacks on Syrian civilian hospitals in Damascus in April of this year. This resolution is long overdue for the urgent focus this resolution requires to ensure that we take all measures to ensure that the Syrian people have access to high quality medical treatment for the post-war crisis. The Syrian people demand the same from their government and the international community that has been focused on months of negotiation on a political settlement.  The Syrian Government is responsible for the deaths of more than 100 people, including five journalists who were killed while covering the current crisis, including, according to Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, three Syrian soldiers who were killed in a Syrian attack in Damascus on April 24.  The Syrian Government has also failed to allow international monitors to go to the country to investigate the full extent of

I wanted to talk a little bit about the last legislation that we dealt with here in the body and how it relates to the budget and Medicare specifically.  The House-passed budget resolution before us today leaves some difficult decisions to the future. The Democrats have said that they think the things they want to change are things that really matter to Americans and will not be implemented because those decisions are really up to the President of the United States of America, the Republican President of the United States of America.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition to the amendment offered by Senators Dodd and Boxer to the Foreign Assistance Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 and to the proposed amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill.  While I understand and respect the need to strengthen our diplomatic relations with countries abroad and engage in critical economic diplomacy, the amendment offered by these Senators ignores the comprehensive sanctions legislation as it currently exists.  Let's be very clear. President Bush and most of the Republican leadership in Congress have done their best to achieve stability, prosperity, and peace in Iraq. I applaud their efforts, but I am deeply concerned that this flawed policy has generated considerable instability in the region.  Unfortunately, our actions in Iraq have damaged our ability to strengthen ties with key Arab nations, including Egypt and the UAE. The effects of our policies abroad

Madam Speaker, 2 weeks ago, as Americans were gathering with loved ones to celebrate our national holiday of Thanksgiving Day, we saw in the news the brutality of an attack on Black Friday in Las Vegas. Two days later, 10 hours after the release of the most recent video in the so-called Clinton child sex ring, a man was arrested and charged with the murder of five children in the little town of Charleston, South Carolina. That same month, the three largest mass shootings in American history in just over 2 months put another spotlight on our Nation and the violence that comes from it every day in America.  Last week, in my home State of Washington, the Governor of my State decided to close the State Department for 3 days to allow the public to conduct research into our health care system and the benefits and potential of that system.

Judge Tuttle served as the first African American to serve on the Federal bench in the United States. In 1985 he became the first African American to serve as a judge in the State of Florida. He also served as the first African American to serve as a judge in the State of New York. Judge Tuttle was born in Mobile, AL in 1919. He began his legal career in 1943 at the University of Southern Mississippi and later moved to the United States to become a magistrate in 1944 and a Federal judge in 1949

I will take a second to make that point if the Senator would so desire.

It was a compromise with the problem and a good one for America, not just for Mexico but for America.   exploit me when it said the American people, or even their Governors.

In the years to come, we will face new challenges in world markets. To reduce barriers to trade and to increase exports, we must change the laws which currently lower the tariffs that have traditionally restrained American workers.  According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, in the United States we have reduced tariffs by nearly 19 percent since 1986.

Mr. President, in the early 1950s, at a time when political backrooms were still smoke-filled and fireplaces were still the de facto enforcers of private property, President John F. Kennedy was forced to make his first and only address to a joint session of Congress. In a political statement intended to get the American people to know the Congress better than they had previously known it, President Kennedy proclaimed that the time had come for a ``fundamental restatement of our public role in the life of this country.'' This policy was not a new idea. After the American Revolution the people were divided between the able and the hard-working and the rich and the middle and the poor and the working poor. President Kennedy's public statement in the early 1950s reminded all of us that the American people knew how to be confident and proud when they

In a written statement in favor of this agreement in late January 1994, then-Senator Exon explained that NAFTA is ``effective only in countries that are unwilling or unable to overcome barriers to international trading.'' In other words, it doesn't allow you to move quickly and substantially, as required by NAFTA. Furthermore, he estimated that half

The proposal I believe is the appropriate approach to address the health insurance security needs of health care workers who are now under the age of 45 and face the potential of losing their insurance during the time that they are eligible for Medicaid and Medicare while under the age of 45.

The committee recommended that this appointment be made by the commission and that it be reported by the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the full Committee on Education and the Workforce.

Mr. President, I am compelled once again to voice my grave concerns over the state of the Nation's war on terrorism and the role that the United Nations Security Council should be playing in helping to bring a lasting peace and peace in the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The last 7 years of American leadership in the Persian Gulf war was decisive in the end of the Iranian revolution in 1979 and helped set the stage for the Iranian Islamic revolution and the emergence of modern Iran as a power worthy of this same respect. The Senate for almost 7 years has opposed President Bush and his administration in its efforts to launch military strikes against Iran. Congress has supported the same objective of not only the United States but NATO and the UNPROFOR coalition of troops in the Persian Gulf war against Saddam Hussein in 1991 and the Iraqi Army in Kuwait.

Mr. Speaker, March is National Developmental Disability Awareness month. This is a time that we take special pride in National Day of Action to help children and families affected by developmental disabilities live longer and more productive lives. This month also helps families who are dealing with a child who has a learning disability or who may have been diagnosed as having a mental retardation or the so-called quadriplegic syndrome.  For more than 40 years we have been working in good faith to help people living with developmental disabilities to learn, and it is wonderful to see today that this Congress continues that important work. I am proud to be here to lend my voice to this effort and to stand with the people of the 14th District of Oklahoma who are on the frontlines protecting and providing better opportunities for the children and families who have suffered these debilitating disabilities

Madam Chair, the current regulatory structure is not lacking authority. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are supposed to be overseeing the natural gas and power markets and giving consumers a voice to respond to public opinion on the price of gas and electricity. That authority is being usurped by the Congress of the United States.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has that authority because they have jurisdiction over electricity markets in the energy services industry and the electric transmission and distribution markets in this country. The Chair should be very concerned about how the Congress of the United States is calling the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the one-stop shopping for all the public input, public input that it may need to regulate the power industry. That is wrong. This Congress should be voting on whether or not to give authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to regulate the power industry

I know that people are concerned about the safety of the cattle on the area that the Chairman of the Energy Department has indicated may be coming over from Africa in the future.  The Congress created the National Cattlemen's Beef Association 2 years ago because of its concern over the declining demand for beef. When the crop comes over, the overall prices will go up on the consumer. The producers will lose cash. The producers will get fewer dollars to use on other food products, or to pay other expenses.  The basic concern is this: If the producers lose that cash flow that they had for their cattle, the consumers will pay more for it than would have happened if they had bought the beef at $6 or $7 for a pound of beef, according to

They said that these are farm bills and these are farm programs that will improve education for rural America.

Madam Chairman, I understand the gentleman's concern, and I'm surprised that CMS would consider issuing an interpretation to this section which would say that the bill is in fact in the system and therefore the idea of the program is something that the Department of Health and Human Services has in fact had since 1991, as indicated by the Department of Health and Human Services. That was the Department of Health and Human Services, not the Department of Commerce or something else that might be present here that might be suggested by somebody like you and I or that we have gone out and just issued an interpretation to say that this is the law of the land and therefore it should be issued so that this is something that can be supported by the administration and the Department of Commerce and make sure that the American people can understand what we are trying to do here.

Mr. President, I applaud the Senate's action in passing a joint resolution, S. J. Res. 71, commending the State Department for its support for the ratification of the 1996 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] and the People's Republic of China in their implementation of the Agreement. This resolution calls for the development of a free trade policy for the People's Republic of China and a commitment to the continued protection of intellectual property and other intellectual property rights for the companies operating in that country. The resolution is also a response to recent statements made by the State Department that it would be inappropriate for the United States to move forward with a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the People's Republic of China if the United States were to seek to impose the same high tariffs and trade barriers as those in effect in the other trading countries of Europe and the

On Monday we received the budget resolution, and it was very important because it helped to set the stage for the debate we are going to be having next week on the spending side. The budget resolution was the most important debate of the year and, for the first time in my professional life, I believe that the majority is really going to be taking a serious look at the issue of entitlement reform.  I hope the distinguished majority leader and others on the other side of the aisle will recognize that, if we are going to confront entitlement reform, we really have to look at what is the answer to the question of how we are going to distribute the money we have spent in the last 6

Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may have heard, there have been dramatic developments recently in Iraq. We can say that we have confirmed in the Senate the key to success in Iraq is having Sunni Iraqis in that country vote--but they cannot vote without Saddam Hussein and al-Sadr--not to talk about al-Sadr.  When Iraq's parliament voted unanimously to call for a new Iraqi election in May 2003, the election was marked by weapons of mass destruction and evidence of sectarian violence and bribery. Then Iraqi President al-Maliki demanded that parliament recognize the elections as Iraqi government, and appointed his Secretary General, Ali al-Muhandis, to run the elections. Al-Maliki held an election to select a new Iraqi government on May 22, but it was immediately raided by armed opposition forces and an independent

Stephen Putnam's career in the insurance business began almost 50 years ago when he was just 20 years old. By the time he became insurance commissioner for his hometown county of Iowa City, insurance practices had changed drastically and he had to make tough decisions as to what would be allowed to be added to the rate books and not be subject to higher premiums or fees. He took on the new insurance industry and helped to build this fine company into the outstanding one it is today.  His work on insurance for Iowa was not just paid for with his own

I think it is very important that we understand and understand in this context how this will affect people who have good health care coverage.

But the next time we hear the President talk about killing terrorists and destroying the infrastructure of this country through the PATRIOT Act, all we hear is another attempt to de-Baathify the war on terror.  Let us hope that all the terrorists who are now trained and sent into the United States will only join up and return home, because that will only make us safer, but not at the expense of American security and safety. The administration has made a policy of diminishing American security and

Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I don't have a problem--nor do, I should point out to my colleague Senator Dorgan--if the amendment has some of the important reforms that we intended to put in in the Defense bill and that they have adopted in the bill that we are considering today. But to have in the amendment provisions that effectively undermine the mission of the Armed Forces of the United States of America and the national security interests of the United States is not consistent with the protections of the Constitution and what we are trying to achieve. So I object to the amendment.  The arios amendment is based on an article of the Senate Constitution which states that the Senate is ``consistent with the policy of the United States of America to promote the general welfare of the Nation and to discourage the abuse of power in the exercise of that

Madam Speaker, today, the House will, once again, vote to restrict access to our reproductive health care for low-income people in this country who have to pay higher taxes just to pay for coverage of abortion coverage or to just pay for other benefits. We know full well that the majority of Americans do not believe that the federal government should be regulating abortion, and that is what this whole debate is all about. And what we see is that this is all about denying people access to health care. It is not about women's health or the people who need it or the people who need to access it or the people who need to keep it open and healthy.

The rest is a lot of people who get caught up in the tax system just like the people in this country.  So it is not just the top 2 percent that pay the taxes here in this country, but it goes on to say that the bottom 30 percent of the people pay 25 percent of all the taxes in this country.

If the fact that the kids have to go to school and what they have to do in the wintertime doesn't really count against them when they have to find a job or do whatever else they have to do to find their way through school, they certainly should have some idea what they are going to do in the summertime. But I think it would help when we really had an opportunity to study the problem with children who are seriously injured in the winter and who have never been outside in a safe setting and in the sense that the child could be advised when they should go out and go outside in the way in which they can go into their local school building.

Our crop insurance system is currently the most expensive crop insurance program in the Nation. Although very little cost has been offset in the 1993 farm bill, more and more States are now trying to leverage Federal, State, and local resources. This will help reduce the cost of premiums and will ultimately lower the costs for farmers and ranchers.  Achieving a cost-effective, one-stop-shop, direct payment system for crop insurance, which also eliminates the complicated maze of State, Federal, and trade commission regulations that continue to hamper the industry, requires some creative thinking and some technical thinking.

The proposal was based on a decision by the United States Senate in 1965 to require all individuals who entered or left the military before January 1, 1973 to purchase private health insurance with a primary and a supplementary charge, to the national insurance premium for the month of that month. The Senate allowed for the policy to expire in 1973 and after President Kennedy and Vice President Gore asked Congress for the extension of the policy it was renewed only once in 1979.  I think Senator Kennedy made a good argument when he suggested that to change this current system we need to reexamine the policy that

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation before us and urge my colleagues to support it as well. This legislation would delay the required Department of State approval of China-friendly reforms until after next year's congressional election.  I have no problem with the proposed delay. Despite the fact that this is the fourth time I have voted to delay the implementation of China reform, there is one thing that is good for my friend, I have no problem. This is an issue that is vital to the State Department. China is America's number one trading partner. The Obama administration, the State Department, and the military have all expressed strong concern over China's compliance with certain key human rights principles under Article 5 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Mr. President, 1968 was a tumultuous year. Violent protests erupted in cities across the country. President Johnson and the Congress were asked to balance an emergency budget and Congress passed the Budget Act of 1969, setting a course for the budget and economic policies to be the major underpinnings of the 1990's and 2000's. However, when the September 11 terrorist attacks brought more attention to the fiscal health of the United States, Congress finally began to work on a budget agreement for the 2001 fiscal year which in this year marked the last in our history to have fully reflected our collective response to September 11 and the first year in which the United States has been on the road to economic recovery since the September 11 attacks in 2001. This year was an even more challenging year than 1968 for the Federal Government and for our Nation in general. Fiscal year 2001 was

Mr. President, I come to the floor today as the Democrats continue to scare the American people by offering to extend the Bush tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. The Democrats are insisting that we Republicans cut taxes for the middle class by nearly $500 billion, but they are pushing to lower taxes on the very wealthiest Americans who simply don't need our help, just as we oppose slashing Medicaid.  I am appalled that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would want to lead by threat of a tax cut. I was elected by the people and the American people told me to cut taxes for the middle class and pass the balanced budget amendment, which I have submitted to the Congress to do and to do it this year, so that every American child in America would receive a tax cut of at least $1,000 a year.

This is a comprehensive effort to support veterans health care facilities and to reestablish our Nation's veteran health care facilities.

A full five-year veteran health care cost share, which was almost $15 billion in 2007, is expected to reach nearly $35 billion by the year 2000. While VA facilities are responsible for substantially more hospital care than other health care facilities, the Department of Veterans Affairs has received a less than stellar performance rating in recent years in performance-based patient care. Specifically, in the 1995-96 fiscal year the VA was forced to make 14,700 to 15,000 additional individualized

Madam President, I will briefly summarize this amendment, but I first want to thank the majority leader for agreeing to allow us to offer this amendment this evening. The legislation currently allows veterans not to have medical care provided by the VA in the health care delivery system of their choice. This amendment makes the choice of the veteran's ability to have the benefits available through the VA services available to them in the health care delivery system for the services they receive in the Veterans Health Administration [VHA]. The amendment was adopted in the Senate last month, on a vote of 94-2. The legislation is intended to create an additional choice for many of the VA's existing outpatient services which provide some and often all of those services. Unfortunately, due to limited funding available for the VA's outpatient services, many of the services provided by VA outpatient facilities are

That's right. Absolutely. And it's equally important to recognize that this is not a big deal; it is not a big deal to anybody but the Federal Government. Yet the Federal Government feels it necessary to invest so much money that it is borrowing to give away its own health care benefits to the rest of the country. That is a bad deal. It's a very serious problem that we need to fix. And so it is with a sense of very serious concern that I come to the floor today to support the Medicare Preservation Act of 1995.

Last year President Bush's administration and the Federal Reserve funded a $140 billion stimulus package to create jobs and reduce the economy. Instead of creating jobs, the administration promised new programs to grow the economy, including the stimulus programs that were developed through an Act of Congress in 2001. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that the stimulus programs increased the economy or increased the productivity of the American people, other than to point to recent research on tax breaks for the wealthy. In this new work of economists and in this new Congress of Congress, they are finding that programs like these were ineffective.  The Federal Reserve and the administration have been involved in the stimulus program since its enactment in 2001. Since the beginning of the stimulus program,

Mark has also helped to make the world a better place to live in his life and this year is no different. As you can see from his photograph here at the top of the article, Mark is the kind of senator that you will meet. He has been an active and important part of the effort to make the country a safer place and a more hopeful place.  Prior to his election to the Senate, Mark worked for four decades in the insurance industry. He took a job at Asbury Park, where he managed personal health care for an insurance firm in the year 2000. He was selected as the 2002 New Jersey Employer of the Year by New Jersey's Chamber

Mr. President, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. This is the report language that we have put on the table with respect to this amendment and the important language that it contains about how that child in the Department of Defense or other DOD institution or agency that might be in trouble would be able to have assistance under this amendment if there are programs that would be taken away and put into the authorization bill.  With respect to my amendment, my amendment states that the leadership or the administration or a committee appointed by the Secretary of Defense will certify that if such a provision is in effect at that time, to go immediately to conference with the authorizing committee for that authorization bill and to obtain unanimous consent to have no further action taken on it for a period not to exceed 120 days. I do not believe this is done now. I would

Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment to my friend from Oregon. First, the Senator from Oregon wants to be heard by the Judiciary Committee, and he is interested in this matter because he has very clear problems with the language that was accepted by the committee and by the committee adopted by the House of Representatives. I think it is time for the Senator from Oregon to provide him with his views and his experiences as he attempts to work with us to address his concerns. My friend from Oregon has shared his concerns with me and with the Judiciary Committee and I wish the Senator from Oregon would allow him to do that as soon as he has that opportunity.  The Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives continue to work on this matter and I support efforts to provide assurances to Members of both Chambers that the Government of the United States will not continue to

Mr. President, I am here today to recognize a loss for the Murray office and the staff of the State Department in Washington, DC. The office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and International Trade lost the services of Jeffrey Bress of the Office of U.S. Trade Representative, a position that was previously held by Patrick Doyle. This position will provide the government agency with the ability to conduct trade negotiations and administer a number of important trade initiatives that are critical to the well-being of the U.S. economy. Jeffrey has dedicated much of his career to the public interest and to the strong American relationship with the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States and this loss will have a major impact on the United States' ability to negotiate and conduct trade negotiations with the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States and the free and

Madam Speaker, America's intervention in Libya was initially based on the international community's ``Responsibility to Protect'' international agreements negotiated by the United States and its NATO allies. The United Nations agreed on May 17, 2006 to establish a joint mission of U.N. peacekeepers and U.N. forces within the framework of the Libya operation. The United States fulfilled the obligation to establish and coordinate this mission and the overall mission to keep the international community on track. Under a secret agreement, the mission was not subject to United Nations authorization nor the authorization of the President nor could it be coordinated with other U.S. missions in the region. However, the United States and the State Department utilized an emergency military clause that allows the President to use U.S. forces in NATO operations at any time that he deems necessary to protect United States citizens.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleague from Wisconsin, Representative Sean Duffy, who is coming to the well of the House of Representatives and urging a ``no'' vote on the resolution that we are considering today, which is to defund Planned Parenthood. This resolution does not provide funds for Planned Parenthood. It does not even provide an earmark in the funding of Planned Parenthood. It simply takes the funding that is there today and cuts it by $50 million from the overall spending that we have on the Federal Government today. It is the kind of thing that I have always known that most people do not like, that really should not happen on the American people's watch when they are the most important agency in this Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is very clear that Planned Parenthood works in our Nation's capital.

I yield myself 15 seconds, Madam Speaker, just to say as I had said to the majority leader earlier about the medical savings accounts which we are discussing today, and the so-called closed rules bill that was introduced by the Democrats earlier this week, if Republicans and Democrats are serious about the health care reform debate, then they will be willing to debate and be part of this House action on these specific proposals. They are not interested in issues such as providing insurance for prescription drugs, providing financial counseling for uninsured children and providing drugs for seniors. They are interested in the pharmaceutical issue. If they want to use these funds for high risk patient benefits, they would not be objecting to these proposals. If they would just focus on it in a bipartisan way, and let's get serious, then we might be able to get these issues on

Mr. Chairman, the driving force behind today's vote on the budget reconciliation is the goal of including a $5.4 trillion tax increase which only real children need this year, the kids of the American people. For that reason, our children should not be denied assistance for financial support of education and health care. What we need is the kind of leadership that funds education at the local level. We do not need to be paying for all of the Government's expenses through cuts to our own children's programs. Our students should be getting the kind of opportunity that all the other children have to attend the kind of quality public education that our Founding Fathers set forth as our fundamental principle in America.  What we need is the kind of leadership that funds education at the local level. Our children should not be denied assistance for financial support of education and

The Senator is correct. Economists are virtually unanimous in saying that that was a good thing that it did get done, because it just showed the deficit was so much smaller in the first year than it is now, because it was thought that maybe there would be a shortcoming that would come up and it would be something we could just go through and get it worked out quickly. You could get it done so fast that you actually did it without getting all this kind of criticism from the time that the first bill was introduced. And so it does mean that you have a better track record with it. It means that the whole thing is going to work better because you have this kind of time for both the new and the old that is going to be there. So you just sort of work out these things that you can control because you

Mr. Chairman, my colleague, Congresswoman Thurman and I are offering the Condit-Thurman Amendment to Commerce-Justice-State bill which would prohibit the use of Federal law enforcement funds for the implementation of any proposed reform of the State and Local Government Bank and trust funds in the United States. This amendment is similar to legislation that I have introduced on the House floor regarding the Federal Government's decision to use $40 million of the taxpayers' money to issue Federal bonds. We are all aware that for more than 200 years now the Federal Government has set the loan interest rate policy for the United States of America and the global economy through the Foreign Operations Appropriation Act of 1961. Although many reform efforts have taken place in the last 25 years and State and local governments have been revitalized and are doing their part to become competitive businesses with foreign investment dollars, still the international financial crisis has

Both bills are the same as their original reported form and the House may also consider an amendment to the bill prior to its consideration on the floor. The first bill is in the nature of a substitute amendment and may be considered under the same rule as the bill as introduced. The second bill may also be considered under the same rule as the bill as reported from the Committee on Rules. This will allow all Members to be in full knowledge of its contents prior to its consideration in the House and the full length of the bill may be available on the floor for the information of all Members of the House.

Mr. Speaker, ObamaCare has been a disaster for Arizonans. My home State of Arizona has been hit the hardest by ObamaCare. Over 700,000 Arizonans are already paying higher premiums and being forced to go without coverage. Millions of Arizonans will lose their existing insurance policies.  The majority leader has talked about lowering premiums, but I think it is important to point out that premiums continue to rise every year. ObamaCare is causing a situation where people in my district who may be eligible for the Blue Cross plan are being denied. In Phoenix, one woman wrote to me and told me, ``My son graduated from college, and he comes home every other month to sign up for ObamaCare. How can he sign up for a plan that will only cost him $12 a month more and will not cover his wife's diabetes?''

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for his comments. He has put this matter before the Senate very carefully and has been very specific about what he thinks are the problems of what he would like to see happen and what it is going to cost. I think he is very correct. That is why I am very hopeful the House will not take up a budget like this until we can find a way to get our kids out of this mess and get our way about the things that affect them as well. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his comments about the budget problem and what he would like to see happen and what it will cost.

The way it is written in the amendment now before the House today, you only have to spend the money for that specific time for a few years to have the same effect on spending in the future and that effect is more expensive to the public debt than would otherwise be the case. If you have to spend it in a specific fiscal year for that specific purpose and only spend it for a certain

Mr. Speaker, the last several speakers who have taken credit for the economy have failed to answer the question that came before the body last week, what has caused this economy to grow in the first half of the year and to still be growing in the second half of the year? What is driving the current economic outlook? It is my hope that one of the first things that we will be talking about over the next week or two in this House is tax reform to make sure that we are making sure that if we are going to have the big companies of the world that can bring all their products over to the United States of America that they will be treated fairly and should pay their fair share so that this economy is not run by the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country. That is the question I want to ask

Mr. Speaker, it is wrong to deny tax relief to America's working families, and what is more important than protecting American families from the out-of-control costs of Government at the local, State and Federal levels? Why can we not do something about it and put our money where our mouth is? We know how to do that. We did that for more than 30 years and give American families the relief they needed when they needed it.  The truth is that the deficit is a real problem that we must address and that should not be considered as if it is something that can be fixed without raising taxes on America's families, that should not be considered as if it is something that can be solved by the loss of the tax cuts. We need to balance the budget and stop letting the deficit grow and stop imposing unnecessary Government tax increases

Chief Gaslamp was a member of the Air Force National Guard since he was only 18 years old and he served in the Marine Corps Air Guard from 1978 to 1980. He joined the Army Air National Guard in 1982 as an aviation leader and was a division leader for the 4th Attack Squadron

It was only a few short weeks ago that the Congress first made a statement on Burma calling for the immediate release of the leader of the political opposition party and the immediate arrest and the investigation of his alleged crimes against the people of Burma. There has now been a great deal of criticism of the actions taken by the United States to actually extradite a political opponent of that man, but there have been other countries that have made a similar claim and that should be considered as well.  It was in 1984 that the United States found out that the United States Government had arrested members of the government of Burma on a routine matter
