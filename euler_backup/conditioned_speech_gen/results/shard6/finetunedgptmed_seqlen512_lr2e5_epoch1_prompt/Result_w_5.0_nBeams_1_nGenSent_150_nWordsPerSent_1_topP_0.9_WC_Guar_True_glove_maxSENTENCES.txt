So do you get, my colleagues, the hypocrisy? They slashed the tax collectors, paid eight Federal employees to pay for our tax cuts which they did not provide to the private sector, cut back on IRS enforcement for small businesses. Then you cut back on your own tax cut cut by cutting back on IRS enforcement for small businesses. You cut back on enforcement for the IRS by cutting back on cutbacks by cutback cutback cutcutting cuts slashed cuts. You do not have a single Page S 17969]]cut in IRS enforcement.

Mr. President, the smoke is housing crisis foreclosures. The fire is the general economy because the economy is still deteriorating and so is the crisis in homeownership that we have been addressing for years now. Now is the time to act to stabilize the financial system and to help house the bill of people who are under the Federal Government's and the economy's hand and the Federal Government should do it by telling those who have put in those billions of dollars of capital that President Clinton will finance those infrastructure spending plans. That means those who have lost their homes because of foreclosures because of this economic crisis that we are facing. They should pay those bills.  The $18.6 billion in this bill--roughly $16 billion in the 107th and the 108th Congresses--would be enough to solve the problem by the end of

Mr. Speaker, President Clinton, in his recent State of the Union Address proposed another Federal Government program to cover the cost of incarceration of Federal inmates for State and local government-designated offenses. The President claims that he wants to balance the budget by 1999. How does he plan to achieve that goal without substantial Federal spending? Because he will not only increase Government spending beyond what is necessary for these programs, but he will seek merit-based contracting instead of incarceration as a strategy to restore fiscal discipline to the Federal Government.  The history of this experiment is the most disturbing and disturbing I have seen. The first major studies of this budget plan indicate that the President's approach could reduce private prison construction in this country by one third. Clearly, the budget proposal's priority of reducing Federal prison beds will lead to greater use of private prisons and a

Madam Chair, this amendment was going to be offered by Mr. Markey, and he strongly supports the language in the underlying bill that creates a voluntary national standards for tobacco use, which would require a consumer reporting agency to notify the FDA if a product actually increased the risk of a given disease percent by more than a fivefold increase on the levels reported by FDA for that product. That does not reduce FDA's risk assessment requirements or reduce EPA's risk assessment requirements, but it does reduce those requirements for those products that are toxic to public health and safety because they reduce emissions of air pollutants into the air.  Mr. Markey and I have been looking at this. He offered the language in the House in an amendment, and he would like to take his amendment to a conference committee. If the other side will, we would be happy to

I think I understand, and I appreciate the point the Senator is making, but does the Senator know what percentage of this bill comes from the State of Minnesota, that we have a bipartisan home-rule constitutional amendment that would say the people who are on the most generous end of the tax scale have a right to not be able to get that first point of tax relief to the most generous part of the society in this country, the people who are most well off in this country so that they do not look at their fashionably priced produce, and we provide a right to the people who are on the bottom end of the income scale, when they are paying the largest tax burden, to have some kind of tax relief?

Mr. President, I will vote today to provide advice and consent to the ratification of a U.S.-South Korea Economic Cooperation Act for South Korea. The South Korea-North Korea Economic Cooperation Act is important to the North Korean regime and to the workers of the country. This is a necessary step towards making economic progress in a region plagued by instability and conflict. In Vietnam, Vietnam lithuania and Latvia are two nations in which the North Korean regime is keeping its economy strong. In South Korea, there is no such uncertainty. A recent economic survey of 75,000 North Korean agricultural and industrial workers indicated that a significant increase in North Korean exports in the near future will likely lead to increased North Korean investments in the South.  Today, the North Korean economy has one of the worst average real-income and purchasing power results in the world

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Employment and Training Act of 2005. Veterans and their families are facing a time of transition, and Congress must act now to support them. Our Nation has a moral obligation to provide needed care and assistance to all veterans, and committee reports should strive to provide greater service to those veterans who face barriers.  A veteran's service to our country is hard earned. Our most recent survey of Vietnam veterans showed that 50 percent had been killed in the line of duty. The veterans of my home State of Michigan face the difficult challenge of making the transition from active duty to civilian life. In my district in Ann Arbor, we have just begun our own reconstruction efforts. We have worked closely with the community, our veterans and employers to make the transition easier and cost-

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the trade agreements pending before the Senate. I first want to recognize Senator Daschle and Senator McCain for their leadership on this issue and the many others on this important issue that will require significant legislation to support.

This issue requires a great deal of analysis and congressional hearings to be done to make sure tax relief and increased trade and intellectual property protection will work for America's working families.  In Panama, Panama City and Panama City's success in offering these tax incentives will make it a natural market for high-tech export jobs.

Mr. Speaker, after decades of Washington irresponsibility, Americans are facing nearly $17 trillion of debt. This week the House is expected to consider a series of comprehensive legislation that will reduce the fiscal burden of Washington on the American people while ensuring that Washington maintains the ability to enact government policy on a bipartisan basis in an open Congress. This week we will also vote on the Obama administration's plan to reform Medicare, Medicaid and our Social Security system in order to balance our budget.  In addition, the House will be considering legislation to reform our foreign policy, which we all agree is in need of reform. These important reforms, I believe, will make a lasting contribution to our economic and national security, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting them and will continue to vote in favor of these commonsense reforms.

Mr. President, I mentioned the AARP and their opposition to this amendment. There is an annual event on the 27th of April that the AARP has now organized to celebrate the 10 years that they have been protecting seniors from Medicare cuts. It is the last chance to save Medicare and help seniors in this country save $9 billion over the next 7 years.  Now they want to protect seniors' Medicare but not in the traditional sense. This does not look like a traditional Medicare bill at all. This is another Bush provision in an otherwise Democratic bill that does not help families with seniors. It does nothing but make seniors pay a premium and will cost seniors about $100 billion over the next 7 years. It does nothing but make seniors pay more taxes and asks them to pay more out of their pockets.  I am disappointed that the majority

The AIDS epidemic is not new. In fact, the tragic pandemic has been worsening since the late 1970s, at a time when Congress was less than serious about AIDS. We saw the violence and senselessness of this epidemic during the 1980s when we saw young men and women being beaten, raped, and killed for having the AIDS virus. When this disease was identified, we did nothing. This past summer, we heard the cries of mothers and fathers who lost loved ones and who lost their homes in a tragedy like

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Indeed, this would be a total prohibition on consideration of legislation that would give the tax rate increased under the bill $2 billion and increase taxes on all taxpayers. The only two tax provisions of $2 billion are in this amendment alone. It would be one of the more far-reaching tax increases in the $10 million legislation that has been passed this year, and it would be one that will actually increase the tax burden for taxpayers and will increase the Bureau's staff; all of which comes at the expense of making choices and reduction in payroll.  We as a Nation have made some very important choices in the last 5 years.

I will just give some of the examples from the Westover East School District in Charlotte, North Carolina. With school choice, we now have a school choice voucher program in operation in the Westover East School District. The program has worked extremely well.  The idea of this voucher program is that at the end of the

Mr. Chairman, the bill before us is mistitled the College Access and Opportunity Act. It really is not about education in this bill and those who are paying for it on the Federal Government or those who are lobbying to get the students and the families of this Nation to pay for this bill. What it really is is opportunity for Americans that can only be realized with a college education.  Let me start by saying, the worst thing that we do in this country is promote the higher education system. We are a nation that spends almost $1 billion a year for higher education, almost $1 trillion this year alone. That money that we spend subsidizes approximately $300 billion of foreign aid. When that occurs, that is what we are subsidizing in our entire education system. When we spend more money than we send abroad, that is money

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill was a committee report that would help bring some relief to millions of State, local, and Federal law enforcement officers who are threatened by crime and who seek relief by preventing and deterring criminal behavior. The chairman and I have put forward this bill to address this issue, so it is a bipartisan bill that is consistent with our intent and the desire of the leadership on this matter for this resolution to come to the floor today rather than pending judgment before the Congress on a compromise that we are going to offer.  So I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for his steadfast commitment to this effort, and I want to acknowledge also the leadership of Ranking Member Burgess and the chairman of the full committee, the gentlewoman from Tennessee, Ms. Hart,

But this notion of holding one bill in your left hand and another bill in your right hand--I think one bill is two bills now, that has a Republican majority in the House and in the Senate now because we did not have a government shutdown the other month because of the tax legislation and because of dealing with health care that were a separate bill that the majority is not going to have to deal with as long as they have control of this body. So we are really different than we are different these days because both are different distinct bills.

Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Schumer in offering legislation that will help maintain a secure and affordable housing market in New York State and around the country. Senator Schumer and I have introduced a bill that would allow for the Federal Government to purchase low-income and no-income housing that is of high-value to Federal taxpayers through the Federal Government agency approved sale commission. This would ensure that these properties are kept safe from unscrupulous developers who would erect undesirable and unnecessary housing on already-established or currently vacant properties. The best way to achieve that objective is to provide for a 6-month period in which affordable market-rate loans can be made through the Government approved sale commission program for these properties.  To accommodate all the existing needs in New York City's private and public housing, such as affordable housing that are small and located

It is, in some respects, deja vu all over again. It is dangerous for government to have a lack of public disclosure of information about issues of special interest importance to the public such as political funding and the health of certain Federal regulators. In particular, it is dangerous for government to have a lack of public disclosure of political contributions received by certain government officials or those individuals who have interests in Government support of one particular political party rather than others. Indeed, it is important to point out that every now and then we find respects for the principle of public access to political information. For example, when the public finds out what the major corporations are doing with lobbyists, the media release it. In contrast, there was a scandal over media donations to the Clinton family foundation. There was a report by the Washington Post in 1996, in the Washington Times

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Speaker, I'm incredibly disappointed by the Supreme Court's ruling to allow Texas to continue to have laws banning the funding of abortions and the repeal of federal funding of Planned Parenthood for providing care for health care for low-income and uninsured children in this country. It is the wrong decision for the country and it is the wrong decision for the people of our country. This country and this economy should not be driven by political decisions on a partisan basis, not on a big-government basis, not on an ideological basis. We need to keep people on track and see this country remain the greatest in the world in terms of health care and in terms of educational opportunities. This ruling is a direct result of the Democratic Leadership's decision to close their eyes to the economic threat that there is going to be a shutdown in January,

Madam Speaker, yesterday Virginia District Court Judge Henry Hudson's decision striking down one provision of President Bush's health care law has cost the Commonwealth of Virginia $2 billion and health care insurance plans in my district and the millions of Americans across this country approximately $20 billion.  This bill will provide $1 billion for $7 billion, which will help for the health care system. It will also cover more than 36 million uninsured Virginians who don't currently have health insurance. The President's bill will increase premiums and deny coverage for so many Virginians that they are less likely to sign up, a condition that is highly likely to lead to Medicaid's demise.

Mr. Speaker, on this day 2 years ago, United States soldiers found the king of Iraq's son Saddam Hussein inside a burning bunker that he had once been using as a city to stage an American military invasion. We all mourned the loss of one of the greatest warriors of the 20th century, but this was a loss that could not be forgotten. It is a hole in the fabric of civilized society.  Today, all sides on the global war on terror agree that the need to find a peaceful resolution to Iraq must be one of the principal ingredients for achieving a lasting peace in that country. Saddam Hussein was a tyrant who sought to manipulate U.S. policy to topple our allies, steal our resources, and use his formidable intelligence apparatus to bring ruin upon his neighbors.  He paid for his terror through weapons of mass destruction

Let me try it one more time. The Senator is saying the States can make the determination that they can't deal with this because they are making the decision now under their State law in what to do with the Federal money so they can have some time to study it and make the final decision before the Federal Government comes in with another bill which I think was passed only this past year.  I think if we apply that precedent to States that are dealing with the issue, it would be even more troublesome because now the States have excluded their responsibilities. If we would apply this same mentality that we have for everything else, we would see that other States are leaving that authority to those States and setting up a mess. That would be another precedent that I think would be used against the States.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and General Government, I was struck by the President's budget proposal to cut Federal-Aid Highway Construction, a program that supports highway and transit safety in general and transportation safety in particular. Mr. President, Federal-Aid Highway Construction has been funded at a reduced rate since the last increase in fiscal year 1997. There are more backlogs in highway construction projects than are now available. Our transportation-related infrastructure is aging. This will impede the future growth of our transportation system and cause further fiscal problems in the future.  Most highway building projects are currently under appropriated authorization. However, over $10 billion will be required for fiscal year 1998 to construct the infrastructure we all depend on to travel to work, to school, and on to and from work. This is

The service chiefs have also made the case for shrinking our base structure. In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services on February 21 of this year, they stated that if the Department of Defense would only use the military force reduction plan, which bases the number of personnel cuts and reductions in troop levels on the President's request, the savings achieved would be enormous. That was during the House Armed Services Committee markup of H.R. 6151. And that committee found that the plan's savings would be so tremendous that ``an initial reduction in the U.S. Forces for FY 2004 might be achieved by 6 percent or more'' without the Pentagon using the service chiefs' proposal.  On September 11, 2001, the military leaders testified that we had to respond to the terrorist threat. They cited the commitment that the services required in order

Our focus will be on the United Nations' new Security Council seat and the importance it plays in determining a new balanced budget that will reduce spending and stimulate economic growth.  Let me first say, Mr. Speaker, that the New York Times and the Washington Post have written about this very important topic. Their editorial yesterday described it as ``one of the defining issues of the post-cold-war era.''  The burden of balancing the budget--and balancing the budget for the first time in more than 30 years--is one that every American should feel. We can all agree that, without a balanced budget, our country cannot function in an honest and meaningful way and, therefore,

Mr. Speaker, yesterday we considered H.

I want to make clear that I am a strong supporter of the men and women who have taken the time to answer that call, and I want to say that this resolution should not have been brought to the floor and that it will not stand the test of time and would have no place in the ``Call for Action'' that is in place.

There will be a limitation on time to make adjustments. But here is what the Senator from Vermont has said. The bill will require more than $700 million in funds for ``operating expenses to obtain the equivalent of a flight hour of space flight, if the flight is conducted on a tethered flight and at speeds in excess of 70 miles per hour,'' and it does not include all the other spending in this bill.

But we should have an understanding that it is more than likely that President Obama will be using force in order to avoid further such confrontation with a nuclear-armed Iran. I think that the good news is that the threat of nuclear weapons has been used for more than 200 years as a weapon of deterrence in sophisticated military conflicts. But I believe that the current status of this situation is fundamentally different.

It provides a substantial increase in funding to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the FBI for cybersecurity assistance to the Government and to the private sector and grants for third-party monitoring of our Nation and the Russian state as a whole to private and non-government cybersecurity providers to help them to be more effective in their work and to better be able to better stop the kind of time bombs that we have seen hit our homeland.  I would note, Mr. Speaker, DHS would be required to create and lead a cybersecurity task force within its agency. DHS has established a centralized review mechanism for public agencies to gain an understanding of the vulnerabilities that are difficult to address independently. Under the new cybersecurity recommendations, the Department would have to develop a framework for collecting, analyzing

The good work that the balance of the committee has done in terms of its focus on what needs to be done to improve our schools, it does not address the importance of putting together the focus that need to emphasize how school officials do not have the ability to really empower the parents, who are going to be the lead parents, as the important leaders, as the teachers, as the teachers' assistants, and the people who are going to carry this out in the schools in this country.

It is one of the most important measures that is on the floor today.

Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is exactly correct. In the little time we have remaining, I want to make sure that the record is clear that legislation passed by this House has very little chance of becoming law in this Congress unless Congress acts to override the Budget Act and vote on it on the House floor with immediate effect. Legislation passed by the House has no chance of becoming law unless legislation passed by the Senate has passed with only a 60 vote bill. So this entire Congress is looking at trying to look at whether we can override a Presidential veto and have it passed as soon as possible.  Now, as Mr. Wolf and I both know, as I am sure the ranking member, Mr. Bonilla, understands, we are very much of the belief that the Executive could veto this legislation.

That was the attitude.

Many WIC programs provide a nutritious and affordable meal to children and families, including pregnant and first-time mothers, and pregnant and breast-feeding infants. Today, WIC programs are facing cuts of about 40 percent of total funding, even though their benefits are growing and the programs are expanding.  This is unconscionable.

The FDA's recommendations do not take into account the economic costs of the operation and their continued use is unnecessary, and it is common practice to get a tax rebate for the purchase of these devices.

This is the second largest Coast Guard zone in the country and comprises 39 islands and 13 bays.  The Coastal Zone serves as a buffer

Mr. Speaker, this Congress--now under new management, as my distinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to suggest--I think it is safe to say they make a promise to the American people that it is going to increase tax relief.  I am not sure where the percentage is, but I do know that $25 billion is not an enormous amount of money. So I think it is fair to say we should make some investments that will have a positive impact, and that is just basic common sense.  It is one thing to come to the floor and say we need to look at tax policy, but I do not believe this particular chart that is being displayed today--this chart represents the child tax credit, where the House version of this tax bill is almost $80 billion higher than the Senate version.

These programs are essential to those who suffer from addiction to these drugs. These programs provide information and prevention services to provide support and better medical treatment for those who are addicted. These programs are focused on overcoming the addictive nature of substance use. But as a new Inspector General investigation into the agency's efforts to save money from these programs found, the drugs used to administer these care aren't addictive--the actual substance itself.

This short bill will give the Federal Aviation Administration $60 million, $50 million, a lot more than in the past, to get around the backlog in FAA to move more air traffic control towers to someplace else. It is also important that we not discount the importance of higher education. This bill provides $700 million to help refinance student loans, with the President

Mexico has now announced that the administration has agreed to withdraw its forces from the border in order to ensure the safety of the speaker of the Mexican legislature, who is being held in a prison in Canada.  As has been reported here on the House floor, more than 700 American citizens have been imprisoned in Mexico, many in connection with drug and immigration issues.  Also, last week there was a statement issued by Mr. President, that the United States should not support Mr. Mariscal, the mayor of Veracruz, who has been imprisoned, and who has threatened to attend an international summit that would ostensibly be held in Mexico City.

Mr. President, in the early 1950s, at a time when political backrooms were still smoke-filled rooms and not so many people had yet figured out what the role of Government was as an actual meeting place in the early days of our Republic, President Kennedy held an extraordinarily important announcement at the White House. He first gave his State of the Union Address where he announced the historic 1968 Iowa campaign that he would run for reelection against the incumbent President. This unprecedented historic event was only the first of what would become many key public speeches.  The words of President Kennedy could hardly have been more consequential.

In short, this amendment would allow the Department of the Interior to take any resources that it has gained to the Committee on Armed Services and to use them for personnel construction at the Department of the Interior. We could easily see a situation where security agencies could get on the government payroll and then be using that $3 million in the $80 million cut to increase its own compensation at the rate of $100 percent.

It is certainly within the Department of the Government in terms of the policy decisions that the Department of the Government issues, but, in fact, it is using taxpayer dollars that are expended to construct that wall. The so-called border security fee program is not paid for out of resources that the United States of America receives, it is paid for. It is paid for by a permit which has no money going into it from the State of Texas. So there is no money going out into the United States to pay for that wall. It

Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong opposition to this amendment. This amendment would remove the provisions of the bill that would prohibit funding for the Disabled American Veterans from receiving even more funding through Amendment No. 910. The President's budget request would increase the VA budget by $245 million for the first time in the agency's history. This level of increase would represent the largest increase in the department's Interior appropriation ever, and would affect all veterans who have a disability. Our veterans are the greatest asset the government has to offer them. They are a huge part of the casino which draws so much crime and violence in our cities, and it is wrong to do anything to separate our veterans from this support.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bipartisan amendment, which would benefit counties in my congressional district in Northern Virginia.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bipartisan amendment would cost $10 million and generate revenues of over $500 million over the next 10 years. Specifically, the amendment would increase payments to State emergency assistance programs from an average of approximately $66 per landowner to $66 per landowner, an increase of approximately $300 million.  Mr. Chairman, these funds would assist counties in putting together their emergency relief plans, which have been more difficult, at the same time, while at the same time recognizing that they are the only funding sources for rebuilding our impacted counties.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Elie Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Prevention Act of 2005 which would support the United States in responding to genocide and serious human rights abuses around the world and set human rights standards that we should all be encouraged to follow as a global response.  This bill includes a new section to require that the President's National Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Emergency Management Agency be abolished and replaced with the European Convention on Human Rights.  This is a smart and bipartisan bill. It is the first time that the House has acted to fully recognize the complicity and violence of the Communist regimes and certainly the complicity of Western governments in repressing the AIDS pandemic.

The overwhelming majority of Americans believe the real cost of this stimulus is not running up the deficit but being a drain on local budgets.

Mr. Speaker, just to point this out, this $5 billion that the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey] has just brought to the floor is not coming from one Member of this House or one Member of the other body or any interest group. This money is not coming from either the Committee on Ways and Means or the Committee on Rules or the Committee on Agriculture or one Member of the other body nor is it coming from any other identified group. This is a significant development. It is a development that reflects the importance of my bill.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey] for her advocacy and her help in making it possible to bring this bill to the floor.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

There has been an agreement made with the President that will allow the Department of Defense to address our concerns about the pilot program for the Weapons Systems Administration, and not before that statement on the Clinton comments.  As I said, the decision to try and have the weapons system be ready for the use of Iraq after January 31, 2003, was not made by the Pentagon until after the vote in the Congress. So the concerns that the Senator from Arkansas raised about the potential for leaks of classified information concerning this program--and I would ask my colleague whether he agrees with that--I do not believe is a valid reason.

The funds provided would be used to provide needed projects and services to enhance the preservation of public resources and funds of the debt trust fund of the city of Philadelphia.

Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of this comprehensive reform of our Nation's crop insurance programs. This legislation, which I was proud to introduce with Chairman Oberstar and Chairman Miller, reforms crop insurance programs that consumers find most difficult to understand and understand the most effective agriculture programs.  This legislation moves away from traditional hybrid and commodity policies, and I am pleased that this has been accomplished by creating new exceptions to some existing coverage limitations that will save consumers some money, while protecting critical commodity-producing commodities.  This legislation continues the careful guidance issued by Chairman Oberstar over the last Congress and makes it more clear that commodity crop insurance is among the areas in which producers can insure their investments against unforeseen and costly policy failures.  Many hardworking, hard-working farmers are saddled with considerable risk as a result of their traditional commodity portfolio

Senator Kennedy died last week of a heart attack. Senator Biden was on a presidential campaign to become the Democratic Party's nominee for Vice President. The very best tribute Senator Kennedy could give to Senator Biden was to name him his vice Presidential running mate.

Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to address the state of our economy and to call upon my fellow Americans to help restore jobs and raise living standards for all of our people by increasing the Federal minimum wage.  By raising the Federal minimum wage, we are hurting the very people who are willing to work for lower wages. Increasing the minimum wage hurts more than just American workers. It also hurts the economy because it does not reward workers with additional income.  A minimum-wage worker is working full time but has the potential to make up to 25 cents an hour over the course of the year.  Just last month, there was news that the Washington, DC, unemployment rate continued to increase.

Mr Speaker, let me talk in general about some of the general areas of our relations with Japan. I have said on other occasions that I think both sides in this debate on the appropriate relationship with Japan are quite generous with respect to the language of the Prime Minister.

Congress has passed legislation to observe the resolution, and Congress is planning a second session of that legislation this year. However, the holiday will not be observed this year due to the lack of appropriations available to the Department of Defense.

We should do it.  Second, the fact is that the American people did not elect the oil and gas industry to vacuum cleaner the country. The American people did not elect the oil and gas industry to jack up the cost of health care for working people in affairs like diabetes.

Madam Speaker, America's intervention in Libya was initially based on the international community's ``Responsibility to Protect'' doctrine for war crimes that was agreed upon in the international community. We should not be misled that Libya is not a state-supported terrorist organization that maintains terrorist war sites or operating bases and provides financial support to terrorist and criminal organizations. This UN report and Congressional hearings confirmed it.  More recently the Libyan Government has engaged in heinous atrocities. According to Secretary of State Christopher, ``I have seen many tortured prisoners. I have seen instances of rape and a recent execution, a former colonel has disappeared after being murdered, and this has been going on in the streets.''  Moreover, the Benghazi hearings clearly confirmed that Libya was corrupt, a self-financed state that provided cover for its own illicit military funding. Libya continues to commit war crimes,
