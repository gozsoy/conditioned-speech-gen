Does the Senator feel the option of job vacancies that may be filled by H-1B visas or any option in the future may be something we are going to be introducing in this country that we have not had that much interest in for a number of years so far in this Congress? And if there are options out there that the United States will be using in this area over the next several years, if we are going to holders of U.S. visas will those options be treated under H-1B, or a new system where, for example, you have an immigrant who has not been here in the United States for 2 years who is going to have those same new opportunities available? And will those choices be taken on a part-time basis or will they be--if you include family situations--someplace else and be treated

Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Timothy McDonald and Deb Schott, who both perished last week in the aftermath of a deadly car crash in northern California that resulted in the deaths of four people and the injuries of seven others. Last month, two other California citizens were injured in the same crash while riding on a helicopter near the Monterey Peninsula.  As a strong advocate for law enforcement and in the Sacramento/San Joaquin Valley region, I am proud to stand with the overwhelming majority of California families who have already lost loved ones to this senseless crash and stand in solidarity with them.  And while this is a significant loss for me personally, it is also one we should all feel because of the devastation it has already done on California's already ravaged highway system. Because California's roadways and highways are stretched to the limit,

Iran's harsh sanctions and manipulation of the global markets is another obstacle to achieving a just, peace-loving, non-nuclear Iran. The IRGC's attempts to acquire large quantities of military hardware and to harass the U.S. economy have forced it to face significant economic and political limitations.

We have passed all of the amendments that have been offered to us on this subject in the last 2 years, without any Republican votes on those amendments contracts to school districts, but every time one of those amendments has been offered in a Republican Congress one Republican Republican vote is required in order for that Pennsylvania language to pass in this House.

This bipartisan legislation would prevent the Federal Government from denying affordable housing assistance to many Federal financial institutions that are actively providing financial services to financial crisis-stricken communities in California and throughout the Nation.  We cannot continue to allow the financial institutions to continue to provide a vast supply of quality affordable housing to the communities that are in need of sustainable and long-term stable financial conditions. The Financial Services Committee is working to bring about reforms that would ensure that those countries with growing economies are bloced with others in the future.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2005, the Airline Disaster Relief Act. This legislation will assist in a time of national emergency and great stress to the airline industry because the fact that the death toll continues to climb is the result of the continued cost of a Federal Government ban on the use of air travel for illegal State residents that is held in high regard as a law enforcement tool.  During the air travel ban debate in the Congress, the safety issues were heavily debated. Not one single safety issue was raised during the ban debate. The FAA was forced to proceed in a way that they could not sustain on safety grounds alone. My Governmental Relations Subcommittee held a hearing where hundreds of employees were told by some local airlines, this is your Federal law enforcement responsibility, and you will have to stop and pay back $180,000

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of our final--our final--appropriations bill for this year. Today we will vote on amendments to be offered by Senators Murray and Nelson. These amendments will be the first votes of the session on any appropriations bill, and they will represent the first votes of this session on the amendment package for the United States Department of Agriculture's current fiscal year.  Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture is under no set budget constraints, we are doing everything we can to find the money to carry out our core functions. Unfortunately, we have no ability to complete work on this bill. Therefore, I believe that these first votes are essential in order to bring to a close our work on this important appropriations bill.  I am concerned about the State of our Federal budget.

Mr. Chairman, it takes $5 million from the DOT's Financial Management Capital account and puts it in the Treasury accounts to finance this study and the study of which Chairman Newhouse has just said this is the only cost increase of all the programs. It is similar to the study by the Office of Management and Budget, which has already made a significant and in fact a significant reduction in these programs and systems.  Again, this is a significant amount. It is well-executed, it has a wide-ranging input, and will help the people of this country to make better use of their public resources. It is an important new source of resources that will help that process of reducing costs and improving the efficiency of public transportation. I commend the gentleman for his amendment and urge its support.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

So I want to talk about some of the things that are mentioned in this cynical bill that may or may not have actually moved the path that the Speaker has chosen to take.  One of the things that was made in my presentation to the Committee on Rules was the bill included a provision in the House version of the Constitution that prohibits Members of Congress from paying for the construction of either a new

Mr. Speaker, from 2001 to 2006, the cost of higher education exploded in this country. The average annual cost has been nearly 30 percent more than the cost of public education in recent years. Every year it has been harder and harder to pay the tuition that is being used to finance the programs of higher education in this country.  Today, as we celebrate Labor Day, I want to point out that over a billion dollars is being spent every year on partisan political games. We have a very, very serious problem in the higher education field. College affordability in this country has been worsened dramatically. Many students find themselves paying more and more for a diploma that they never really needed in the first place, so they can sit in judgment on the taxpayers.  Higher education is the gateway for generations to learn, the way everyone needs to learn to be

It is time for the Senate to follow the hot line to see that no one is in charge when there is an official change in the pay of this Senator and others who are trying to close it down. In one day alone we have had to call 22 offices, more than 300 calls. There has been no back and forth, no communication with the Senator from Mississippi. Yet on this side, we do not understand this allocation process. In the words of one Senator from Michigan, Senator Durbin, we are using Senators' health care dollars.  This ought to be a cost savings for taxpayers and people who are in their pay period. It has to be, and it ought to be a bipartisan effort. The Senate

Lithuania was once the Soviet Union's Baltic and Eastern European sister country. It was a Soviet military occupying base which had failed to break through the heart of the Soviet Union to February 4, 1945.  Five years earlier, the Japanese had allied themselves with the cause of freedom in Eastern Europe. The Jewish population of Lithuania, perhaps with the help of the Poles and Latvians, was vital in persuading the people of the Warsaw Pact not to give up their struggle for freedom and democracy. In mid-February 1945, Prime Minister Kasia (Przemysl) Krasnik became the first to state the Lithuanian Government's support for the Jewish national crusade.

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the legislation offered by the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), and thank the gentleman from California for his support of this very important legislation and for his outstanding work on this important issue throughout the course of this session of Congress and throughout the technical and additional work that is provided for for this bill here today.  This legislation is the work of a number of individuals and organizations across the country and museums all across this country, including the British Museum in Washington, D.C., to build on a very successful and successful project, which is called Exploration with the Smithsonian Institution.  Through this expedition, we are exploring the potential for our Nation to become a beacon of light in the future, to bring enlightenment to the world

All of us are very much concerned about excessive spending by the Federal Government. We know that spending is so high that families and small businesses are running up a government debt that the Federal Government can't even pay its bills.  The Government must raise the standards of living to make sure that the rules of this land are fair and just. Over 200 Congressional Democrats have introduced a bill to give families more options when it comes to hiring Federal employees by requiring more Federal employees to have health insurance and lawsuits of equal or greater importance to that worker's job.  And if that doesn't help to achieve these goals, we need to eliminate Government waste, fraud, and abuse so that we can save taxpayer dollars and build a stronger economy.  The JOBS Act makes it easier for American workers to get good jobs by giving them more choices,

In many ways this legislation is a first step toward a future that Americans can rest assured that it will be their children that they are entrusted with the responsibility of freedom and hope that we have been warned and continue to be warned will be theirs. The United States had the foresight to begin the process that they have proceeded in the historical study of this worthy agency, but they have continued to adopt policy decisions that damage the agency's mission of safeguarding American children and their future.  The Boy Scouts of America teaches healthy values. This includes applying character. In many ways, this bill provides the guidance to those youngsters who will volunteer in the field of scout leadership.

This bill will save $300 million over 5 years, take care of our children's health care, and then bring down the cost of prescription drugs and more Americans who are in pain with that.  This bill is so popular in our country because it eliminates one of the loopholes on the tax policy of this country which allow tens of thousands of families to save money, reduce their health care costs, and have health care coverage for their loved ones.  It does that by allowing the family doctor, the physician to charge their families less per beneficiary, allowing a family to get access to private insurance for those illnesses, that

So it would be in order for us to have security briefings before we go to conference on the budget resolution, I believe this morning, to give them ample time to comply with the provisions of the budget resolution and deficit reduction provisions that surplus spending, whether it is military, whether it is other discretionary programs, the rules of the Senate. That is something we will have to work on. It would be a short-term briefing.  The Senator from Wisconsin knows of

First and foremost, this legislation would restore one of the fundamental reforms passed last year and approved by the House Appropriations Committee in July when it approved a 5 percent pay raise for Members of the House and Senate. That pay raise should continue for the new year and into the next year to give the House and Senate the funds they need to purchase the equipment for the sale of our Nation's assets.  But unfortunately, I will say to my Democratic colleagues that the new pay raise expired on July 1. Why not return to the Contract With America, H.R. 4409?

The first concern is the deficit-cost impact on consumers, investors, and others that Senator Frist has identified.

I think if you have ever taken a survey of the public and you are asked what the average cost is of a replacement vehicle because it is so old or so in need of repair it is so much effort to get the vehicle to the new owner that you would be surprised what you find out because it is so cheap because it is so old that it is not even used because it is so need that it is not even problem-free.  I think one reason that we are going to lose so much money is because we will buy penny-wise and pound-foolish. We will buy up things that are not needed. This last year there was a little bit of an uproar because we had a faulty eye on the road, that we did

Mr. Chairman, I once again urge a yes vote on this amendment to limit the cost of EITC benefits to welfare recipients eligible for them by insisting that States only award them if they are required to by the Voting Rights Act and the 1996 Community Development Block Grant Act. This is not a poor effort to force States to support two programs which are not in order in the States of their States; it is an effort to force States to support two programs which have missions, different missions and, if supported, are not in a contradiction.  I believe that the amendment does this, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, our Capital City is mourning the death of one of its leading citizens, Joe Boyd Robert Boyd Ford, Jr., who passed away in his sleep Monday morning in his home in south Philadelphia. Boyd was the son of citizens of Long Island and an uncle of Mr. Ford. He and his wife Nancy lived in his beloved community of south Philadelphia where he was a friend and the proud father of two beautiful children who we are all so sad to call children of his very life and that of many thousands who he touched.  Joe Ford was an outspoken and forthright advocate of private property rights, proudly supporting public ownership of the land and an attempt to establish free market principles throughout his life. In the 1960s, Joe Ford challenged the disparity between white and black people in the South by establishing South African We Know Negro Clubs that created

Mr. President, our budget deficit represents not only a significant fiscal expenditure, but also a substantial challenge to our economy and to the American people. Every year, our economy relies upon a steady and successful flow of goods and services. The Government's role in this and every other important aspect of the economic life of this country is indispensable.  But the problem is not only an economic problem. It is a moral problem, because this fiscal fisc is not only a burden on American families but is a danger to the people of other countries which are affected by our trade policies.  Last week,

Mr. President, an old Chinese proverb says: ``If you do not pay the doctor who will come to save your life, you are nothing.'' That is the case today with Medicare Part D reforms and the Medicare Protection Plan that will help millions of seniors today and their health care in the years to come.  The Medicare Protection Plan builds upon the much-needed reform of Part A. Under the current law, for a Medicare patient who is paying Part B for his or her services--in other words, pays out Part A's annual premium--Medicare currently pays only 15 percent of the cost of services covered under that Part B prescription drug benefit. That number is set to increase by 1 percent in 2014 and thereafter, leaving a grand total of 75 percent of Medicare Part A costs covered in Part B, which is reserved for costs of Medicare

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 89, which expresses the sense of Congress regarding the decision to stop United States participation in the COPS Program. Although the President is well aware of the importance of this initiative to the efforts of the United States Government to promote peace and security around the world, the President has not invited members of his administration to the White House to discuss this important initiative with the American people. As we learn about the extraordinary efforts of the COPS Program and the friendship of leaders from different corners of the globe, we will see if President Bush was aware of the importance of the COPS program in reaching the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives as a coalition to fight climate change.  The COPS Program is a cooperative program within the U.S. Global Peacekeeping Program, USAID

Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio raises a very important question. I may offer an amendment to the amendment offered by the Senator from Oregon. That is to make the existing increase of the range in the bill for the Department of Defense of 1,000 miles because the President--the President of the United States asked the Department of Defense to make this increase so that we could provide additional support to these brave soldiers that are in Afghanistan today.  I was able to talk to the Senator from Oregon in our hearing in the Committee on Armed Services, and I must say there is no question that I think he is not prejudiced about the wisdom of making this change. But the question the Senator raises--and I think is a very important question for the Nation--is, how much does the President have to spend? I suppose the answer is

We want a policy for a specific issue that drives up costs, lowers jobs and gives an advantage to the oil and gas industry, but they are opposed because they want to put political advantage ahead of the well-being of the American people.

Madam President, in a few minutes, we are going to vote on this resolution to honor the service and the sacrifices of President Clinton and to honor the contribution of members of the Armed Forces who have provided extraordinary support during the course of these long wars on the other side of the world. We are going to debate that resolution today, and I want to take this opportunity to highlight a few other significant initiatives that were part of the legislation that has been considered on the other side of the country that are critical to groups of people in Israel, and especially to the people of Israel's northern border.  I commend my colleague from Utah (Mr. Bennett) and all of those who have been involved in this process, the majority leader, and the President for managing this very important debate.  Some believe that the very idea of dealing with Israel

Mr. Chairman, I think if we had a truth in labeling law for legislation that came from the House here this Congress which would have included spending on health care for our veterans, it would have passed this House this Congress. However, when we looked for a way to test the truth in labeling law, instead of supporting it, we took it out of the bill.  We asked a number of veterans groups to speak out. We asked the representatives of both sides, and then you asked a doctor, as a representative of the consumer who has to rely on the fact that a veteran will know exactly what drugs are available, is that possible for such a statement? The answer is no. You can be willing to put all of your faith in the real world and wait until the law is broken. But we do not need an FDA

But no matter how much you say you are in the eye of this storm and it is this time of need here in this country or this occurs as a result of what happens in the region, no matter how it happens, these liberals don't seem to care one bit.  Today I thought, where are these liberals when this Congress needed to stand up for the American people? I have to ask myself that question. Have they

Let me clarify some of the false assertions about the defense authorization conference report. It is the Committee on Armed Services that has the responsibility of providing recommendations to the Defense Department. That is our obligation. But the Senate and the President must get the legislation passed and signed by the other body to ensure that we will use our force reductions for our defense needs so that we can use these costs to continue to make our Nation more secure without requiring annual revenues to pay for those weapons systems.

To further answer that question, I would like to read from the letter the White House has sent to Congress this week asking for more money to fight global warming that has a $2 billion budget for that purpose and should be paid for if the President accepts the new agreement that he just offered that will meet those criteria so he will then be able to send $2 billion to the White House this week that would take us to that meeting on Wednesday night and maybe even the Clinton administration meeting.

Madam President, I rise in strong support of S. 1361, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1996, as well as its Education and Skills Enhancement Amendment which would provide for $5 billion for college funding and the completion of three national testing programs.  This legislation builds upon a bipartisan coalition of legislators that included Senators Nelson and Kennedy in the education, early childhood and research areas. S. 1361 adds $5.4 billion in new funding for those important efforts, including educational research and workforce development programs that will improve academic and vocational outcomes and provide higher expectations for working men and women. These improvements will help ensure our Nation's disadvantaged youth are given the opportunity to attain a high school diploma, allowing them to compete for advanced careers.

I do so in full support of the conference report that we are now preparing in the House to be adopted today and the war efforts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Iraq reconstruction missions. The Senate has its own caucus and the new members of the war in Iraq are of the minority party in the House of Representatives where we have been working very hard on areas where the Coastal Plain of Iraq is right up against the gulf of Mexico. We have been working on the restoration and stabilization of the Coastal Plain of Iraq. We have been working on areas such as reconstruction for the rebuilding of the villages there, rebuilding the towns

Then he came down with this afternoon and he is going to be here in the afternoon.  Mr. President, the agreement that we have agreed to will permit consent that both sides can get their amendments on this bill in order. However, I think that we have made a lot of progress. We are going to have a moment at 2 o'clock to go over the amendments that we have agreed to.  We will have a time agreement for amendments. We are in a bargaining stalemate here on the other side on that bill.

This legislation will ensure that students have the resources needed to pay off their loans in order to be able to pay for college without paying taxes or fees. In the next 10 years, the cost of college tuition and fees for 2 million college students will more than double, from $4,700 to over $13,000 per year. As Congress works to tackle our nation's biggest financial challenges, the cost of college is only going to get more unaffordable.

Mr. President, recently, the State of Oregon and several Federal agencies signed a memorandum of understanding signed to protect Oregon's national parks and public land values against potential development. The agreement with the States will also prevent the use of funds from local land exchanges without the express intent of Congress providing such clear direction in the future.  The agreement was delivered to the President this week and was approved by the Interior Committee. It is a fair and responsible proposal. The memorandum requires the President to evaluate the impact of any land exchange on visitation, economy, and recreation to determine whether to place any restrictions or restrictions on public access to the parks. I share the President's desire to understand the impacts of new development in these scenic National Park System lands and their potential impact on the park system and the Nation.

Unfortunately, it has been forced to lose that bill by the Democratic leadership of the House and the Senate to prevent its ability to be signed into law before we have our Fourth of July celebration here in the Capitol Police and at the White House. That is why I have to come to the floor today and talk about this problem that has been caused by the continuing effects of the Republican leadership.  In this process, the Senate has been in session, the House has been in session, and we have been unable to go forward with this legislation.

Mr. President, I wanted to quickly review the historic 1st session of the 104th Congress, which occurred last Thursday, March 19, 1994. As the Congressional Record reflects, Members had 2 days to debate legislation passed by the Senate in January. But we still face large budget deficits that will be balanced in 7 years if we do not act today. Therefore, legislation such as the budget resolution passed by the Senate passed legislation enacted by Congress in the House of Representatives which would have passed amendment by a large margin.  During these 2 days, we debated amendments on three issues: 1) The balanced budget amendment; 2) The stimulus package; and 3) the Haiti sanctions bill. So much for our House leader from the House saying, ``let's do whatever it takes to get the budget deficit down.''  Let me outline those three issues in

The underlying bill, as we know now, was an abomination of a piece of legislation, but what is even worse is that all of the supporters of this piece of legislation have never even read the bill that passed last year and certainly never see the unfairness of the bill that they are promoting today. All they do is Internet cry that somehow this will solve all these problems by simply making people responsible for their own mistakes and then they are willing to spend tens of millions of dollars to tribes, the salmon ranchers, the airlines, the mining companies, and the pharmaceutical companies to find ways to increase the harmful impacts on these fragile ecosystems that have made this area so appealing.

I think all of us would be surprised if we do not have a bill like this in the next Congress if it is done well. It is time to give interstate banking a much needed break. It is time for this Congress to make our business in the banking industry more accountable to the Nation, the private sector, and individual families. It is time for the Congress to do its job.  Interstate banking is the means by which one State or more banks come together to finance one major enterprise, such as a mortgage, car loan, or even a clothing store. Because of the multiplicity of activities that take place under interstate banking, there is great need for uniformity in the rules, procedures, and regulations for interstate banking.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1261. The programs authorized under the Workforce Investment Act of 1996 have a proven track record of helping to provide important public and private jobs and improve our workforce in the United States. I believe the bill before us contains a broad and confusing program. It restricts, for example, the ability of persons to use their Social Security benefits for an eligible employer-sponsored health plan, while limiting the taxpayer's ability to substitute employer-provided health insurance benefits for those under the bill. It further expands the scope of a number of welfare-related insurance options--in one case, to include children's healthcare--that are not currently available.  In addition, the bill undermines the basic premise underlying the bill, which is that economic growth would be enhanced by permanently eliminating the earned income tax credit, or EIT

Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order on Cyprus comes on the eve of the 21st anniversary of the declaration of the breakaway nation of Cyprus. While this anniversary has many international events on its mind, this is the time to look at the long-term impact of Cyprus on the United States. America is a vital player in the region in several ways. First and foremost, since the 1960s, American investment in the Middle East has played a pivotal role in the Florida economic development. This makes the United States the most important trading partner of Cyprus in the Mediterranean region. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Tourism, and Overseas Commercial and Industrial Competitiveness, I know the importance of that relationship.  I have had the opportunity to travel to Cyprus to visit some of the companies and individuals that form the foundation of the economy of Cyprus

Mr. President, much has been said that the Mitchell bill does, in essence, not upset the existing rules of the Senate or allow a limit on the number of amendments offered during an individual legislative day. However, some Senators and staff have raised concerns about the Mitchell bill because it would have a negative impact on Senate business and in particular, on our fiscal responsibility and the bill would have to be revised to comply with future insurance legislation. I would like to address the concern raised by some Senators and their staff and the insurance provisions in this legislation that they may have concerns about when considering the insurance benefits employers may provide to their employees.  I would like to first outline a set of general comments which I hope the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Thune) and others may appreciate.  First, I agree with the Senator from Arizona that a bill

Madam President, next Monday marks the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act. That law did more than just change the way we make government more inclusive and responsible. It made it possible for more Americans to live their lives with the dignity and respect that we recognize our American heritage requires. Yet for some reason, despite that promise, the religious right has not embraced the ADA. That is a shame. I think it is really sad that the religious right believes that the ADA is so important that it has to claim its right of religious discrimination, which I believe is a terrible display of hypocrisy on the part of many of their friends on the other side of the aisle.  The Supreme Court specifically protects Americans with disabilities. It says, ``The States are precluded by the Federal Constitution from denying to any individual,

Let me say to the Congress we cannot send American troops out in Africa and Bosnia and Liberia and Somalia to come here and say to the people of the United States, ``We want to help you, and we want you to help us.'' Those Haitian guys got their country out of the jungle, they took their booty, and they did not try to starve us. They did not starve us because of an arms embargo. They did it because of the mismanagement and violation of U.N. resolutions by the USAID, the United States Agency for International Development, other international agencies.

The gentleman is very clear that is what is happening in the program we are providing for this portion of this bill that he is on track to meet.  The problems arise as a consequence of this program being part of a universal health care system. With respect to insurance, these kinds of provisions will keep insurance policies salient, reminding employers about provisions concerning disclosure regarding denying policy provisions pertaining pertaining clarify such as requirements that young children be in charge of paying child care, so they have a stake in it and they have a responsibility to support it.

Mr. President, the Senate is in its second week of debate on the future of Medicare and Medicaid in light of the changes that are being proposed on the way forward for the future of those two programs in the House of Representatives. It is for that reason that I have continued to work on this legislation which will help us improve Medicare and help provide some additional resources to the program to allow for its long-term future military deployment and to ensure that the Medicare program is not only adequately funded but has a future in the future without Iraq and Afghanistan. The Iraqi Independent Accounting Office announced that it received fiscal year 2002 payments of $4.4 billion in Iraq reconstruction and support activities. This is a significant step forward for the Medicare program. While not all of these $4.4 billion are included in this legislation, the Federal Government must recognize

HHS does have an exception to this provision in the health care reconciliation bill that bans health care exchanges. This is in the open rule, so the committee would be in a position of not seeking approval of this. That is the procedure in the Affordable Care Act.

A continued denial of the Holocaust and the East European persecution of the Jews constitutes a form of anti-Semitism that should be met with global support, and at this moment in time we should not be passing legislation like this without providing the protection for all people who are not considered white.

Unfortunately, this bill fails to adequately address the problem of smuggling of illegal aliens and opioids into this country.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, 2 years ago in the 111th Congress the sponsors of the Recovery Act proposed budget cuts totaling $4 billion for Social Security. These cuts would affect seniors who are already spending close to 40 percent of their income on Social Security benefits alone, and those who depend on Social Security to care for their elderly parents and care for their children. These cuts are unacceptable choices. They threaten the security of Social Security, their retirement security, and, in the end, end their opportunity to choose whether or not to live to a ripe old age.  A genuine opportunity to reduce the deficit was offered in this Congress. The real compromise was to balance the budget.

That is an arrangement which allows the States to use the Federal funds for those purposes.

I would be pleased to do so. In choosing the term ``compelling,'' we relied on what the judge in Massachusetts said was the phrase ``substantial evidence.''

In what is perhaps the most politically charged program ever designed for drivers in America, highway drunk drivers kill more Americans every year than alcoholics do. Three quarters of drunk drivers involved in fatal crashes that end in death are the result of drugs or alcohol.  An estimated 43 million people drink alcohol every year and most are younger than the average 20- to 29-year-old. While Americans need to stop driving their young sons and daughters too drunk to get their drivers' license and sign up for a school course in driver training, we can't allow America's children to be impaired

Sadly, in the last couple of years, we have seen a very sharp downturn in the American economy. This time is one of the worse years we have seen. We have now experienced an even worse time as a veteran in this country. We have seen a very sharp downturn in the relationship with other nations, with Mexico, with Canada and with Joshua tree.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Solomon amendment. Mr. Chairman, in my analysis, this amendment goes a long way to guarantee States the money they need to have adequate environmental monitoring to do their jobs. Let me be clear. There should be no doubt that States would rather reject this amendment than not have the funding they need to approve the permit to approve the use of certain proposed facilities that would oppose our State's ecosystems and impact on our environment.  I am hopeful that the concept behind this amendment will withstand scrutiny, as well as to be recognized as effective legislation, when the authorizing committees of the United States Congress meet to act on final environmental reviews and approval of public lands.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. While some have contended that this is a bill that would not help taxpayers in the long run, I am concerned that it would continue the economic stagnation and mortgage speculation which we are seeing today. This bill would have a devastating impact on home buyers and investors by increasing interest rates on mortgages and other financial products and companies that will result in an increase of interest rates for consumers and businesses that industry seeks to protect and provide for. The more borrowing that we do not create and the more we deposit into our financial system, the more we lose.  This is not a bailout. This is a bailout of the American people.

As I said, I describe this as a clean resolution, a resolution that allows us to proceed on all amendments but will require additional funding in the coming days. This bill will take effect tomorrow morning as we speak. As we try to balance the Federal budget, we must look to our spending restraint and make sure that our spending is balanced. This funding reduction is important, but that is not our responsibility.  I say to my friend, I have to say I agree with his view that we have to balance the budget this year, but I cannot be absolutely certain this is the only thing the Senate will take up. We are also aware that our energy and defense programs could face a severe shutdown, and so this is a necessary move. So I don't believe we should rush into this funding cut unless we have assurance that the President

Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against the Republican tax proposal to raise taxes on Americans and corporations. In doing so, I say this Congress should be doing more to increase tax revenues for government so that it can spend them more effectively. Tax increases in this Congress and proposed in the new Congress will not only hurt the working class but also the middle class and help the wealthy.  According to a recent study by economist Keith Poole, most of the tax increase on average will go to the richest 5 percent of Americans. The survey found that of those who received their benefits and have invested in the American Dream, the wealthiest 10 percent have been the biggest winners, not least as the largest losers. The main winners have been those who have assets that may pay for their business, such as stocks, bonds, equities, mutual funds

So the one thing I would say to the Senator from Arizona is it is important we get our own house in order. We need to get out of the way and focus on how to get this economy going.

Mr. Speaker, our country has a proud history of honoring our military heroes, and in this year we can take advantage of this pride by recognizing the soldiers and first responders in our country who sacrifice in our nation's service to our great Nation.  We can do better than this. While this is a good year for our military and our contributions to their success in both training and providing benefits, it is crucial that we also acknowledge and honor those who put their lives on the line for our Nation. We owe a debt of gratitude to all who wear the uniform and the courage to sacrifice for it.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

There is another area that I have some very serious concerns about, very serious concerns, and that is the possibility that we might be having to take some time off from the war in Iraq and perhaps having to go back to full strength before we get the war over before the next election in November because there are people in the military who have come back from conflict that they have not gone through the course of their service but they have not gone through the course of their military careers that they would be required to go through before they would be taking time off of the days in full military-style combat.  Now, there have been a lot of questions about what the vote on the renewal of the war is going to be like.

They get a lot of economic growth, and in many instances that is for the benefit of our own people.  But the issue is that the States that have the least amount of people out, and that the seniors--and I am going to continue--these are seniors who will be well served by these programs that take care of them, they have to bear a disproportionate share of the cost.

Mr. Chairman, very briefly, this is one of those issues that really gets you angry. And what is so frustrating about it is that we could take those costs that are going out here and just cut them out so we can actually get the benefits that we are talking about today back into the States because it is so time consuming. It is like playing the role of the ball that was dropped on the field while the play was actually up, and I guess we are in the right venue in terms of getting some of those benefits back in. So I think it would be helpful to vote ``no'' on the McCollum amendment and all that stuff, but then allow States like North Dakota to have some flexibility to deal with it, and as my colleague said, the Federal Government would now be going in and doing something to help people who

Mr. President, this week, the Senate is having yet another debate on legislation to restrict health care coverage for women under the Affordable Care Act. The Senate debate focuses on women's health care coverage.  It will focus not only on healthcare coverage, but about health care choice and access for women as well.  When I was a member of the Senate Republican health care task force, we were always proud of the House health care plan because it was based on an effort to provide affordable, quality coverage to women.  However, this is a debate about access to healthcare for women and family planning, and I want to remind colleagues who have left us that last month, we voted to remove the preventative services paid for under this particular bill. That was one of the main reasons that we defeated the Senate amendment.  This is also about

Can the Senator from Utah tell me whether I am correct in understanding that, despite the affirmation that the law does not require the use of food stamps to be used for abortions but only for the necessary activities specified under this act in the context of any particular case that may occur prior to making this determination by that correct way?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to welcome and to recognize my pastor who offered this weekend an opportunity to do a community service and a food drive at my local supermarket at the National Market at the National Mall. Although the offer of the food drive will come as a welcome relief to our farmers and ranchers who do so much for the American people, the implications of this wonderful event can not be overstated.  What our Nation could not care less about: our freedom of speech, our freedom of religion, our ability to be healed from our afflictions, our safety, our dignity, or our eternal salvation.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote to ``No'' on this cynical attempt to curb all of these wonderful freedoms and privileges.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I have said many times that to say that food safety in this country is not the greatest safety it could possibly be would be the biggest understatement I could give. Food safety in the United States is far more than just something we buy. It is also something that the majority of Americans are strongly committed to, and it comes out of their own pockets--from their own kitchen tables.  In 1996, I held a meat-to-liquid package sampling ceremony at my new home in Eureka, Colorado. As part of this, I stopped to have a brief lunch with a few of my foodies and also met some of the chefs at my local fast-food chain. As I learned more about their commitment to food safety and how we can start to change the culture of consumerism in our country, I

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting to think that we are having this debate this week because these days so many Republicans are saying that the election of 2016 is the beginning of the end of America's historic role as a global power. They have promised for years that that would be their final judgment and they have proven time and time again that they are frauds and fools.  What makes it even more unusual is that at this moment in history they are still asking us to accept a certificate of engagement, a document that still is classified in their vision of what the future holds for this country and for its children, as if they have not already known what the world is going to look like.  And their own children know that when they go to college this November they will pay $
