Does the Senator feel the option of job vacancies that may be filled by H-1B guest workers is important to our country to the extent that we would ask the United States to provide the workers in some of these companies at least with the option of working in the United States if they are not going to use these H-1B visas? Is that part of the proposal that we have for these companies that would be eligible for a new pool of workers? The Senator is familiar with this issue because this legislation passed with overwhelming votes. I want to get some idea of how much impact it will have on small businesses across America. I would like to get a better picture of what these employer pools would be like.   Antar Grant, vice-president for jobs at the Bank of America in Pittsburgh, PA, talked to me this past

Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Timothy McDonald and Deb Schott, who both lost their lives in the tragic train accident on April 26 in my district in Rock Island, Illinois. Although the number of days that Timothy and Deb were tragically killed is less than 5 weeks old, they already have lost two more families in this time of mourning. I would like to extend my sincerest condolences to the McInnis families and to those in the Second Congressional District of Illinois who are dealing with this difficult time. I also want to express my support for the International Relations Committee and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Committees in their work to improve the health care for our service men and women on Active Duty who have returned home from Iraq and Afghanistan.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of our final--our final--appropriations bill for this session of the Congress. I want to pay tribute to Senator Murray and her staff for their hard work and efforts on the bill.  We have had a long week with a large number of amendments. We are now all working on a final list of amendments that we can accept. We have a number of votes remaining on amendments, but we expect to complete our work early tomorrow morning.  The amendment that I will now offer I am offering along with my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, and Senator Cantwell. This amendment is very simple. We will get the veterans out of Iraq and Afghanistan so they don't have to worry about someone sneaking into their office, causing them to get themselves hurt. This amendment would require that American soldiers on Iraqi ground

Mr. Chairman, it takes $5 million from the DOT's Financial Management Capital account and puts it into the building funds account of the Environmental Management Program, so that when those funds come in for the environmental management account, they will be increased by the same amount as we were going to take from the funds for the building fund. That is correct.  Mr. Chairman, I would suggest to the gentleman from Illinois that it is entirely reasonable to transfer the use of these funds from the Environment Management Program to the Environmental Management Fund and on the same terms and conditions as we used to have in the environmental management account. I say to the gentleman from Illinois that in the fiscal year 1995 funding it used to take 10 percent and will use it to use from that account for environmental management to $5 million. So there is absolutely no reason to take this

I come from a small town in the State of Oregon where people are coming to Congress, this is a national issue that people care about very deeply because we are fundamentally worried about the health of this Nation. There is a sense that if the government at any time was going to overregulate, to adopt an agenda that would increase our Federal Government spending, that the people who were going to benefit were going to be those who had the most to lose in that or had the most opportunity to be beneficiaries of government programs that were creating burdens on the economy in this country. That has been the very core of the American dream that people all across this country have worked for. And

So this is very much a separate question but in our minds we have always had this fundamental difference of whether it makes good sense to spend more money in some of these things that we believe in that we believe in because the fact of the matter is, the dollar that we keep coming back to is increasing in value every year in terms of its

One last myth goes like this. This procedure could possibly be the best procedure in the world because it does not make a woman pregnant and has been proven to be safe and effective in treating my daughter with the serious type of genital Herpes she has had for the last 8 years of her life, despite the public outcry against this procedure. These people do not want a woman with an STI to know that she is pregnant. I am not trying to be mean to my friend. He is a good man who has been a good friend to me and to his family over the years and who is trying to do the right thing for people in my State who are sick or who have been sick who are in danger of a serious birth defect like my daughter has had for the last 8 years of her life.

Madam President, one of the things I did not do when I talked about the Defense Appropriations bill in the early part of this year is to comment on the funding of various military services and how they are in need of the kind of resources they are getting at this time. While there are not many people in the Senate working on the floor about this, I believe it is important to remind our fellow Senators that the Department of Defense is operating at a great disadvantage compared to last year. The reduction in military spending has been severe. In recent years, we have not seen an increase in defense spending that is comparable to what we did in the last administration.  Military funding has been cut by more than $170 billion since the Clinton administration took office. It has not been less--in fact, it has been actually increased in the last

Mr. Speaker, from 2001 to 2006, the cost of higher education exploded in this country. At the time that the President first proposed the increase in the cost of college in 2002, the median income for a family of four was just over $30,000 a year. In 2008 that figure was nearly $34,000 a year.  While I wholeheartedly supported the President's plan to increase the cost of college, I did so for two very different reasons. One was because it was the right thing to do for America and for our country's future economic future and the other was because it was the wrong thing to do for the Nation's students. Instead of working on the programs that we thought would be successful at increasing the quality of higher education, the President instituted a public program of massive cuts to support a politically motivated budget point of

Madam Chairman, this is a thoughtless and destructive amendment. I strongly oppose the underlying bill and urge my colleagues to reject it.  For the next 100 years Congress will spend billions of taxpayer dollars in just one State to support a specific program--education. Just think what the results could be.  A bill such as the National Endowment for the Humanities--one of Congress's most effective and effective instruments of promoting civic education--would expire at the end of this year. This amendment would prevent the NEH from even spending the money it appropriated to the Federal Government for the next year, unless Congress changes it. The NEH already has a very poor track record of promoting educational standards and has had just 15 very successful years in promoting quality of education.

It is the end of the kind of safety net that built this country for the last half-century.

Many of the proposals that were in the President's health care law were recommendations that were worked on by bipartisan Members of Congress and many other people who agree with the President on one principle or another and have a real desire to reform health care, but they were not endorsed by a majority of the American people and there was strong resistance in Congress

Mr. Speaker, last week in the Senate, a resolution was introduced to censure Senate Majority Leader Dole for what appears to be improper conduct with the custody of foreign ciphers in his office. The resolution charges that the Senate majority leader has ``relinquished'' his office. The legal problem has never been answered, but the fact that Dole is now the majority leader makes this resolution even more important for the House and for our country. It is also a step in the right direction for all of us in that we put in place a process that would ensure that every member of the Federal Executive who has any financial interest in this situation would be held accountable for the charges that have been raised here in the House.

That is the projected income under current law, that we would spend $11.3 trillion, we would spend $11 trillion if we spend $1 billion more on this project. This is a projection that is much lower than even the House bill that passed the House in a year when our debt was about $9 trillion. This $1 billion more would not put the debt on the ceiling and we would not be here, which would cause the interest rates to rise and create even more income for the people of this country. So this is a much lower estimate of how much additional money we would be spending over the next 10 years if we raise the debt ceiling.

In my view this policy, which appears to be aimed at slow-walk or delay the President's efforts to improve our Nation's cooperation in the field of diplomacy and development for the sake of a few isolated nations such as China and Russia, is both unwise and badly flawed policy.  I would point out that the President does have the authority to call on his National Security Advisor within the United Nations Security Council

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and of Israel's right to defend itself against Iran. As the two leaders of our two democracies we should be seeking ways to deepen our cooperation in response to Iran's nuclear ambitions, especially in the area of efforts to develop a more durable nuclear deterrent. This is an important cause and one that we must both support and support with action, strong action, and we must have clear leadership from the United States. It is on the basis of Israel's right to defend itself and from Iran's nuclear intentions and Iranian aggression that we must support this resolution.   aside from the several crucial issues of importance for Israel and for the Israeli people, this resolution also addresses the Iranian nuclear threat and Iranian activity towards Israel and against the Middle East peace process.

Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Durbin to protect jobs for American families.  The Durbin amendment would repeal the tax on unemployment benefits so that Americans working in good jobs would not be forced to get unemployment compensation when they take their unemployment benefits off the unemployment rolls. If our economy fails to recover in the short term, this tax will backfire, providing companies with nothing more than a short-term emergency benefit. If this recession turns out to be a flop and returns quickly to the status quo, we will have gone on record as having a vast number of Americans that are working with no benefits.  One study recently suggested that about 25 percent of those working part-time had either exhausted their benefits or had fallen onto the unemployment rolls at some point.  Senator Durbin's amendment would do

I was pleased to be the sponsor of that resolution, and I would like to take a moment to make an opening statement in support of that resolution.  Let me just say that I believe this is the first time that the Senate has taken the unprecedented step to suggest a three-year authorization to build this new medical center in Michigan.

I am not sure that we are even talking about the lowest possible cost.

Mr. Chairman, I once again urge a yes vote on this amendment to limit the increase in research that this bill proposes to provide the National Science Foundation.  We have about 40 to 50 different programs that are on the congressional agenda or are being discussed for appropriation. These are programs that have not had the benefit of the Senate's consideration. They should be under consideration because they are good programs that are hard work by good scientists. They are not too expensive for the National Science Foundation to fund and need to be authorized in the year 2000 or 2004. They also will provide a good opportunity for the private sector to participate in these programs because they are good programs to fund but which might not be able to be performed if they are not authorized in the year 2000 or 2004 because of limitations that we have in Congress on appropriations. That is why

Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part that an amendment to a general appropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law or if changing existing policy or procedure is in fact a change in the meaning or effect of existing law or that of existing policy or procedure.  The rule also makes it clear that a general appropriation bill shall not be amended to change existing law except where the change is clearly authorized by statute or other law. It is my understanding that there is no clear authorization in this bill nor is there any change that will be contrary to the purposes of the bill. The point of order is sustained and the amendment is not in order.  The CH

Mr. Chairman, the response of my colleague is a commonsense response. Again, I am here in favor of a balanced budget amendment, so I understand that was passed by the Congress on a bipartisan basis last year and the President signed that. But I want the gentleman to understand that we have no jurisdiction in this matter to give further relief to people who are working now under the present system. We have not been given the authority to do that under the current budget process.   Hawks, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, indicated that he thought we could maybe get a reasonable solution. Now, to the gentleman's credit, he said we should look at it. We have to do a full-blown study, so he offered to keep the House in session and have the two-thirds vote of the House that voted last year.

Allow me to quote from one of President Obama's climate change advisers, Dr. Daniel Schrag: It will have a massive cost in jobs and reductions in energy costs for generations to come. So what we see is we have a Republican majority at EPA who will actually take people who are strongly against clean air and keep them there. I guess the question is if that is not a strong enough challenge to the majority leader himself to say he is not going to accept the President's administration plan and to now stand up and say that this will not pass the Senate and become law. Well, the American people have made it very clear on a bipartisan basis that they are willing to work with us on all issues, particularly the environmental protections that we have put in place over the years and that are the people's business.

Despite the overwhelming response and many good ideas, a provision was added to the subcommittee conference report that will end the public comment period process for next year's bill.  Just like in the first year and the second year of the administration, Congress needs to slow the pace and allow the public a reasonable amount of time to speak before our committee votes.

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the bottom line here and the reason that I believe that we have to do this right is because the economic results of this House budget deal are not going to improve that result as long as we continue to spend more than we take in, which is what we are doing with the CBO numbers that we are using today, $500 billion a year over 7 years; $800 billion over 9 years; $900 billion over 10 years. That is not much good. So this represents a modest $550 billion increase for what I think are some very needed investments.  Now this does not raise taxes at all in this budget deal as part of any budget increase, or as part of any budget cut; but what it does is it provides for investments that we need to make that have a potential to increase the

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Lebanon Sinking Ground disaster. This tragedy made international headlines and has had a profound impact on the suffering of Lebanon's 1.8 million people.  On June 12, 1982, a field reactor explosion tore through a ship at the Delaware site known as the Murrah Army Ammunition and Refinery Complex off the coast of Lebanon. The blast demolished a 35-foot long construction crane on its side. The blast sent shrapnel, concrete, and wire flying up to 5 miles into the air. Thousands were immediately evacuated from the area and a myriad of other deadly accidents were caused by these explosions. One of the deadliest was the failure of a private security surveillance radar near a work site in Beirut where private helicopters were conducting night surveillance. Three of the four jet

I believe that this would make the progress for the protection of our society as much as anything in the area of national security that we would have on the national stage and would be one of the better ideas that we can bring forward that will achieve a greater and greater level of protection for our individuals in this country and for the security of those in other countries.

The passage of this bill was due in large part to the efforts of the Labor and Human Resources Committee in my home State of Iowa and the many groups which included the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Conference of Mayors in New York City.  In March 1996, under the leadership of then Senator George Mitchell, I submitted an amendment to the Labor and Human Resources bill which had the support of 14 Senators. That measure was unanimously adopted and when it was reported by the Labor and Human Resources Committee on April 2 I joined Senator Mitchell in introducing this legislation in the Senate to repeal section 434 of the 1996 act.

To further answer that question, I would like to read from the letter the White House sent to Republicans in June when it proposed a clean debt limit increase, and it says it this way: It is the President's objective to increase the Nation's debt limit this fall to an amount that would reduce the Federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over 10 years to achieve that goal. It is the President's desire to make any needed spending cuts in that plan to accomplish that goal of reducing the deficit.  So the White House knew this was coming, it wanted to do it and it wanted to make sure that it did it in a bipartisan way. That is what the Senate Republicans said we ought to do. We ought to take this bill up. They offered that to the Senate Democrats and the Republicans voted on it but it never

In the meantime, Congress has the opportunity to pass a long-term debt limit bill that sets new limits for the economy and gives this Nation the certainty it needs to stay on the path of fiscal responsibility.

We think that is the right way to start the debate on this very important issue that Members of Congress should be allowed to express themselves on with the rest of the American

That is why she was such a good role model for Christina Taylor Green--the 9-year-old girl that Christina Taylor Green created in this country.  Christina was a 9-year-old girl that was inspired by this kind of a vision, and she is on the streets today speaking out in this very vibrant world that we live in. She is a source of inspiration for so many.  Christina has had the courage, the resolve, and the vigor to go to prison and put her life on the line to promote equal rights and the right to life and to make sure that those women and men in the FBI and the CIA and here at the White House are, by virtue of their good faith, protected. She is an inspiration to so many people all across this country. I hope all the American people will come to honor Christina Taylor

Mr. President, this amendment would unfairly rescind building and facilities money that was finally committed to New York and New Jersey just last year. This amendment will not get rid of the problems of this building complex but in fact it will destroy it completely, which is exactly what is happening in Washington, D.C. This building was never built because the original plan for the project was to build an old airport on a new runway that was never built because this complex needed the money to remain in operation until the airport was complete at $5 million for all uses and until it was ready to reopen when it was finally completed this year at $4 million.  I think it is fair to say that we could build this facility right here in this complex today, if we could get a judge to agree with us, and we could not do it

If we are going to go back to the same problems that we were in a year ago when we had a budget that was so out of balance that it actually put the majority of all the time in the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congress was paralyzed and could not get a budget done, the white Republicans in the Republican Party said do not even consider that they had a chance of getting the budget out of the House of Representatives, do not even consider that it could be done in time to come up for a vote before the end of the year on November 7 of this year. We made it clear that if that is the case we would not consider it for a vote in November 7 at all. It was not for a vote in November 7 at all.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of Wisconsin's seniors and taxpayers to allow seniors to take in more of their own money when they shop for new homes. My bill would permit people in Wisconsin and all 50 States to purchase a home that is not owned by the Government as their current home. This is a great way for taxpayers to save money while getting the best possible value for their hard-earned dollars. The fact is, there is no ``costs related to the sale of the home'' in this new law as it currently exists, which I believe is unjust to the States and taxpayers.  In Wisconsin, I would have been happy to have passed this legislation just a year ago, but in that time we have passed this bill on other very important bills, and the House has passed it already.

The Tibetan Government has systematically discriminated against Tibetan religious minorities and Tibetan religious expression.  Tibetan leaders have charged, without evidence, that Chinese officials are preparing to take the Tibetan spiritual and political leader, Lama Anying, and to release him in exchange for his release of Buddhist monks imprisoned and tortured by Beijing. Tibetan leaders have begun threatening religious minorities and Tibet's Dalai Lama with violence if they carry out the threat of arrest and a trial and one more example of the Chinese Government's ongoing disregard for human rights and its repeated disregard for international law.  Last month, Chinese authorities physically and verbally abused thousands of students at the University of Tibetan Studies in exile and imprisoned them. These arrests

But despite the fact that prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in America, there is a lot of progress being made in this area. Some of it can be attributed to the increased awareness of this disease and to prostate cancer itself.

Mr. Speaker, as the markets struggle under the weight of billowing examples of corporate greed and political corruption in the last 3 weeks alone, the liberal media and political campaign machine is back on the campaign trail saying they ``want to get it right.''  Today we will vote on Speaker Pelosi's plan to change the rules of the House in order to make it more difficult to rein in corporate greed by making it harder for lobbyists to pay for Members of Congress' travel to their private places of business and much of their private time on the dime of the special interest.  Yesterday, President Clinton said: ``The House Republicans are looking at a proposal that is right to rein in the influence of big money in our system of politics. It puts an end to special interests buying influence over our system of government. It is about fairness.''  The

I appreciate the question from my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky. To achieve water security, we all have to work together. This bill addresses several of the most important environmental priorities that we as Members of the Senate take very seriously. While I oppose the bill, I hope that in the conference we will work together on additional environmental priorities. I have, for example, an amendment I will be offering later today that will address an important issue for Kentucky and other States where the production of more than 10 million barrels of oil a day is very serious. It includes the Nanticoke Development Area, the Ozark Land Grant Foundation, the Eastern Kentucky Center, the National Veterans Resources Center, and the Louisville and Western Kentucky Water Research Centers. These include provisions to improve our ability to protect the environment and promote sound public policy. In addition,

Thank you, Madam President. I come from a background of having earlier been in the Governor's mansion in Arkansas where we held the election where we had the first African American Governor of the State of Arkansas. I have also been in the Senate of the United States of America on two different occasions, working closely with the President of the United States and working very closely with the Secretary of the Senate, the Secretary of the House of Representatives and all the conferees on the budget. I have been very proud to be a part of the work of the U.S. Senate for many years in the last 20 years. We were on the Appropriations Committee for some years when there was a budget agreement with the President of the United States on the spending side of the budget.

Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in a colloquy, and it involves the amendment to the Defense authorization bill and to military construction appropriations to increase funding for health care benefits to Members of Congress. We all agree it is important to provide benefits to members of Congress to ensure they have the necessary quality of care they need to perform their constitutional duties and that our military services have the equipment they need to protect our country.  There is a difference of opinion over the quality of health care benefits currently available to members of the military. The Department of Defense does not provide our Members of Congress with the same level of health care coverage as other Federal employees and some other Federal retirees. Our former and current employees often have to use long-distance services to get their health care in order to make it to and from work and

I rise to discuss the balanced budget amendment. It is not a controversial amendment, but it is a very serious amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  For the past 20 years, Democrats and Republicans have worked together to produce a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that would assure that the Congress can meet the three-fifths majority threshold needed to raise the debt ceiling. When Democrats and Republicans both controlled the Senate and the House of Representatives, we had a provision in the Contract With America that required that the Congress raise the debt limit at the same time it balanced the budget.  Today, that rule has changed. For the first

This amendment is an additional $100 million for the section 8 program and there are similar provisions in other bills. That is why I support it. I would oppose anything that would reduce the ability to provide these services to others who otherwise could not because of their need or disability or their costs or because they live in poor areas or in other ways. We all know that we have had great problems with regard to the number of people with severe needs and disabilities, but this money is very appropriate for that purpose.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1261. The programs authorized under the Workforce Investment Act provide the largest source of funding for women-owned small businesses in this country and to a significant degree for men-owned businesses in this country. These programs are also the largest source of funding to States to hire women and men. Currently only 6 percent of women work for a family-owned business and only 6 percent of women workers have health insurance.  Women earn 77 cents for every dollar that men earn and the gap has been growing steadily for decades. We have needed to address this important disparity for far too long and we must do so today.

While Congress explicitly permits a State court to try children supported by the State in a civil proceeding without the aid of Federal law, the court shall not process benefits owed to or supported by the State except in situations where there is a showing of violation of State law and the reason for the act is simply wrong. We have seen both Government and court officers use this provision as a loophole to circumvent Federal law.

From 1976 to 1984, Attorney General Campbell served as Nebraska's first U.S. attorney and passed the supreme responsibility to prosecute major crimes to his successor, General John Day. After a 20-year tenure in the Nebraska Supreme Court, he was elected U.S. attorney for the second consecutive year in 1989 and was reelected in 1993, again to a second consecutive term. His following years as attorney general of Nebraska were also marked by his steadfast commitment to protecting and serving the people of his State.  As a Chicago police officer from the 1960s to the 1970s, his firsthand experience with the law was invaluable to him in representing the people of Chicago and throughout the Nation in court. In 1967 he was

Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to thank Pastor David Sievert for opening Congress this week and being the first Congress that Pastor Martin from God's Corner Baptist Church in Bayonne, New Jersey, has come to speak in honor of our dear friend, our community service leaders, and we all in this community that our Congress did so much to make an example for those in the country today that need those principles that we hold so dear, people that we want to stand by in their hour of need and for all their community service and faith giving work in this country.  Pastor Martin recently did work in the AID people's shelter in Berkeley, New Jersey, that is how he first got started with Community Service Day, and he spoke to this committee with respect, and he talked about how the faith is so important to us today.

Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend from Indiana, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, for his amendment. He has done a great job in this area. There is one other area that is a little less clear than the farm bill is in terms of it being in balance or in Federal balance.  I want to tell my colleagues we were able to get some money from agriculture. It is a lot of farmers that have not been able to get the money in the past to buy the old type sugar beet fields to use as feed for their livestock. So we thought that would be one area in the bill that would be helpful for our agricultural industry. In fact, it is, because of the Senator from Indiana's amendment, a very small amount. But, in fact, we have the largest agricultural yield at home in this country in

Mr. Speaker, today's Special Order on Cyprus comes on the eve of the 21st anniversary of the introduction of the International Criminal Court for the prevention of the financing of terrorism. It is long past time to help that court to complete its work and to establish a permanent seat in The Hague.  Today we are reminded of how to do it. We can make this legislation a reality. We can make it work.  The bill before us today authorizes $1 million of tax funds to be transferred to the ICC in order to be used to support this vital office. The State Department has already transferred more than $1 million to the court in other statutes this year for the IC to complete its work on the part of the United States. So we should be doing this today.  The State Department has already begun sending information to the court

Mr. President, much has been said that the Mitchell bill does, in essence, not upset this agreement because it does not offer financial assistance to China. It does not suggest the Chinese buy American companies because the Mitchell bill does not give Chinese banks $300 million for loans to American companies. It does not say that American companies will have to pay a higher interest rate if they can get better financing from China than they would have had to pay for the investment if they had to pay for it from a foreign country. It does not say to the Chinese that if they get financial assistance we should cut our own subsidies to them because they can get a lower interest rate than we should be willing to pay for those benefits for American companies.  This is about life and death. This is about what happens with health insurance, pension insurance, unemployment insurance--

President Obama is surely anxious to get this mission completed before we leave for the Democratic National Convention next month.  If that is the case, my hat is off to President Obama for securing a very special invitation from President Assad of Syria to visit Washington in July. It is the only way to ensure the safe return of his kidnapped wife and 3-year-old son.  A little more information: Syria's President Bashar Assad has previously extended his visit to Washington three times.  Now I read somewhere in the Washington Post, Mr. Speaker, that the White House had given a Lebanese presidential delegation invitation to President Assad to meet with President Obama.

Mr. Speaker, we support this legislation because it is important that the Federal Government implement rules to protect the health and welfare of our Nation's seniors and make sure that our Nation's critical services are not overburdened with more paperwork and unnecessary data. While this bill does not do everything we all want it to do and we all want it to do in an easily understandable way, we must go on record for the fact that this is the right thing to do. It does not do everything we think it should do in the appropriations process for any reason other than the fact that we have to do it in the appropriations process and we do it in the way we do it to make sure that we are doing the right thing in terms of the health and welfare of the people of

Mr. Speaker, as the daughter of a refugee from Nazi Germany, issues of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are not new to this body. During the first 100 days of this Congress, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia have been top priorities of this body and the Republican leadership for many years.  My home State of Michigan, the seventh largest in the country with over 25 percent of the total area in which the United States has a population of 5 million people, is home to some of the largest concentrations of Arab and Muslim immigrants to our country. It is with great concern that I see so many of my constituents in the western part of Michigan and throughout the Eastern Lake Peninsula and in other parts of the United States who are struggling to achieve the American dream in the face of the ongoing war in Iraq.  And today I rise to stand in solidarity

Mr. Speaker, thirty-seven years ago this week, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Roe v. Wade which defined the boundaries of woman's constitutional rights in the United States. It is now time for the Congress to follow the advice of the Court and adopt legislation that would effectively limit the legal rights of women in the United States of America. I urge this House to step forward and pass legislation today that would take a vote of this House to finally follow the Supreme Court's lead and protect the fundamental right of women in this great Nation to make a decision as to whether or not to have a family and to protect the health of their own unborn children.  Congress and the American people must do everything we can to protect the rights of American women who want to exercise their constitutional rights and to put the policy before politics to tell American women where their

What really made the story not so happy for them is they had a boy that they knew in the very early years of life that they did not know all of the answers to.

Madam President, I know the Senator from New Jersey wishes to speak. There is a lot of talk about the impact on small businesses that a Medicaid expansion would have on them. And I agree with Senator Casey when he says the most difficult part of this would be that the hospitals would be going out of business and they would have to have less money to provide the care for these individuals that would be in need. But, I think we have a lot more to do than what the Senator from New Jersey has provided, which is to take on this because it is not just small businesses that need it--and they are a real reason for the legislation we have before us.

In fact, the bill which was actually passed by the House last December failed to meet basic Senate provisions requiring full Senate approval of legislation considered by this House and which was ultimately signed by the President on January 7.  The House language which has been revised in this conference report was included in the October 1995 conference report to the Energy and Water appropriations bill when the Senate adopted it in April 1995

That consideration, in many ways, is a better alternative than the administration-supported plan to extend funding for Operation Enduring Freedom. That plan is a plan that would actually lower the overall military readiness by about 4 or 5 percent, and I think that is an issue that needs to be addressed.

Currently, all of this legislation requires local officials and States to negotiate with the Government of the United States if they are going to undertake any proposed development because it is a Federal responsibility and a Federal obligation would be eliminated if this amendment becomes law.

This reflects a Federal debt increase of $1,419,486,000,000.  Ten years ago, February 11, 1982, the Federal debt stood at $2,917,331,000,000. This reflects a Federal debt increase of $1,516,664,000,000.  Fifteen years ago, February 11, 1975, the Federal

The net result was that the President's plan was brought up, and voted down 97-3 by the Committee on the Judiciary because it would have allowed these companies to continue doing business with the President that they had been doing under the Republican law without a price because this is the normal business that they have been doing under the President's law because it is the result of the law that they brought up on the Senate floor here today.  The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] made a very strong argument that this was wrong because it was irresponsible. He said it was irresponsible to do this.

Paul has dedicated his life to the health and well being of people all over our great country. Throughout his years in the Senate, he has been tireless in his fight for our children and his fighting for the most vulnerable among us, and to his wife of 36 years, I can only say that we will all miss his leadership on the Environment and Public Works Committee and on all the other committee business that we both have to do in this great body. It is hard to believe that he has taken so many of his legislative years away from the people who truly care about this Nation and so many of its people. But he has been able to serve as the Democratic leader of the Senate on the Environment and Public Works Committee for

That, in and of itself, is a subsidy. Let's be honest. It's Federal taxpayer money to corporate Washington. It's not American taxpayers paying for it either.

Madam President, the word ``bipartisanship'' gets tossed around a lot in this town. Unfortunately, we have a problem with that word. It has no place in the legislative process. I am referring to the practice of putting more partisan bills in the Federal regulatory framework than the problem presented by the Obama health care bill.  The problem facing the health care industry in health care reform is a massive, widespread problem: the lack of affordable health insurance for America's hardworking families. The health care industry alone contributes to the shortage of affordable health insurance by 1 to 3 million workers today, and that is a serious problem in health care reform.  These workers have been working hard for years to ensure that health insurance coverage for themselves and their families would be affordable for them and their families. The health care industry provides health insurance coverage for its employees based on age

David says: ``In light of the President's veto of the BRAC proposal and its expected substantial reductions in military construction budget over the next several years, the Senate is now poised to adopt a bill that would reraise the spending caps for defense projects that do not bear arms on the Department of Defense budget plan approved by the White House, or for projects which do not even bear the threat of weaponry and without the threat of force. Although I don't necessarily believe the Administration is `out of control', this editorial demonstrates why we need to continue this debate and amendment process for the remainder of this Congress.''

The United States is the leader in reducing the global threat of terrorism and combating international terrorism and its impact on the U.S. economy and national security. Over the past 2 years alone, our Nation has taken significant steps to combat terrorism with more than 28,000 personnel at the border and 16.5 million hours of radio communications across our Nation from land to sea.

This Congress will begin the process of taking the necessary steps to reform our Nation's broken immigration system and finally deal with the problems caused by the recent terrorist attacks on our Nation. But in the long term we must move away from the current system of unlawful immigration in the first place and start to ensure that a law of the land, which has been broken for too many years and which has not changed with the times for decades now, is one that is enforced and enforced with the same vigor and resolve as it has been in

That is a mandate that cannot be met until we do that because it is a mandate from the American people that they work and they pay the taxes that we ask them to pay and they turn in those jobs and they pay the gas taxes and the property taxes and all of these other taxes that we pay and yet they continue to do it.

I think we have gotten a lot of things right on this. We have not even been able to get it through the committee. I think the Senators have done the best they can to give us the technical and the legal support that we need so that this

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues in remembering the victims of the tragedy at Ruby Ridge last Saturday. We are grieving here in Washington, D.C., but in the great State of Idaho we remember the loss of the lives of our neighbors who have been friends and colleagues, who have been neighbors and family. We are mourning the deaths of the young men and women whose lives were taken in a senseless act of evil, but we remember our men and women in uniform who have been wounded in this act of terrorism.  As we recall these men and women as we hope and pray and remember their actions and as we hold them in our hearts and minds, we must be sensitive to the reality of today's global marketplace. I just returned from China where I met with a number of our trade officials here in Washington

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3355, legislation I introduced earlier this year to amend the law which allows the Federal Government to contract with State and local governments for hazardous waste processing and storage to provide for the safe and efficient disposal of hazardous waste in these communities and providing for the necessary liability relief for the State and local governments involved in the disposal of waste on the premises of those facilities. This legislation addresses the problem of waste transportation by following the underlying Public Law 106-58 enacted by Congress in 1998 to provide for the necessary liability relief for the Federal Government for all Federal and State transportation of hazardous waste by for purposes of disposal on property owned by the Federal Government to be used as public facilities or as the permanent homes of families who voluntarily move from those

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. Mr. Speaker, in the last year, the cost of prescription drugs has more than doubled for our seniors in this country. They are more than $4,000 more than they were just a few years ago. And I just want to put this in the right context because it is exactly this perspective that I wanted to talk about with the House on Medicare Advantage today because the time to change is now. It is not going to take much more than one-third of 1 percent of the people that are on Medicare Advantage and the one-third of 1 percent of the people that are on Medicaid to get the United States out of this financial crisis that we are in today. We can keep this budget surplus that we have and this the war that is taking place in Iraq coming to a halt

Over the past year the American people have been demanding this end--and it is time that Congress and the public got it. This legislation will provide a true reform of campaign finance law in an unprecedented way.  The unfairness and arrogance of large special interests exploiting American's political system for their own political advantage must end. The public deserves confidence in its political system and we must ensure that Congress's activities do not entangle ourselves in personal credit card balance swaps and other misconduct.

Mr. President, let me clear up a couple of issues. First, my colleague from Arizona is trying to answer a question that I just raised when he voted ``no'' on last year's conference report, which I opposed and we will continue to oppose in conference. We are very proud that this bill deals with the part of the bill that deals with refundable tax credits for business at all income levels, regardless of income level. The section that has come before the Senate is now permanently attached in the conference agreement. It has never been part of the bill before the Senate this year. So the amendment that my colleague from Arizona and I have offered would simply prevent that tax credit from being permanently attached in conference until this bill passes the Senate in this session of Congress and becomes law. The amendment would only apply to the part of this bill that

The House bill needs to be the floor for what we accomplish out of this bill, as they say. If we don't pass it in the House, it will be out of the bill in the Senate as a budget resolution that we do in the conference committee. That is something for which we have to have an up-or-down vote on the House floor. So we need to get it passed in the House before we vote on the Senate bill at the end of the day because it is important that that budget resolution be done as the floor for spending reductions.  I understand this is not a big deal. We will deal with it when we come back next year. Let's take the bill that was sent to us that we agreed to over here so that we could take it down here, which we agreed to

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs' Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce and the District of Columbia be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on April 29, 2013 at 2:30 p.m. in order to conduct a hearing entitled ``The President's Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Request for the National Flood Insurance Program.''  The 324-page September 2012 reauthorization of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] for the 2008 and 2011 fiscal years and the 1310(b) program expired on June 30, 2012. The 2012 reauthorization expires on December 31, 2012. At least 21 States have either not received a request for money for the 2012 or 2011 periods because of technical problems in making the 2012 request. I note that the ranking

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, America's children could once again be the last in line for a government welfare program if we do not vote for the Dole welfare proposal tonight. No one wants to take America's children from the streets to the department store, but I do not want to see American taxpayers paying for the early education of an American citizen as long as our people do not have a workable school system and that means a Federal Government school system.  I want to make sure that school children in California and America, who are facing the most urgent educational and social problems in the world today, have the opportunity to graduate from good school teachers and a good school curriculum. I think that is what we ought to be doing when we find a goal we can accomplish, a realistic goal, and when we

Mr. Speaker, this legislation has vital energy provisions. Vital. It has important tax provisions, including the long-overdue extension of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program to keep families in their homes and pay our bills until November 11. So vital that Senate Republicans blocked our efforts to get them to agree to it until we restored the ability of our hardworking Members to put bills in the continuing resolution before them that can pass both Houses and have the President sign it without any delay or request from the other side of the aisle. So vital to our country that, again, we were able to put this legislation up this week without getting those much-needed provisions that the Republicans want to block until after the election because the Republicans have it in for the country and for us to put this legislation to rest for now. This legislation would be stopped by the

Mr. Speaker, I rise today after weeks of outcry for action to acknowledge that BP and other oil companies are in profit and continue to profit while at the same time making it clear that they are continuing to exploit people and the environment to further their bottom line.  Yesterday the Speaker called this a fix-it bill, which the committee refused to allow. Republicans have been demanding, here on the House floor and for the first few days of this Congress, a fix for Congress to ensure that we know exactly what is happening. We know that there has been failure. We know there has been a pattern. And we know that BP has failed to provide the American people with answers to the questions they have about why they are making money while doing harm to our environment.  BP is out to profit and have something to hide. We have

Mr. President, let me, if I might, point out some of the statistics, and I hope my friend from Florida will respond to some of them because, in fact, it is not just one part of our State that will have to suffer these kinds of budget cuts as a result of this legislation. It will affect all of them.  First of all, it is important to point out that a number of programs in this area which have received so much praise from all of us over the years are going to be taking a big hit under this bill. While it is a statement to be made about some of the science that we believe is absolutely essential to achieve our interests, I think it should be understood, as this chart shows, that the language of this legislation is not in the bill itself that is before the Senate now; the bill

Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator Kohl, and 16 cosponsors to offer the House-passed Better Regulation of High Tech Companies Act of 1994 as a stand-alone measure that is also cosponsored by more than 100 other Members of this body. We believe this bill will serve as a model of improved regulatory enforcement that will ensure the industry does not benefit from one piece of the regulatory apple but rather provide an environment that will encourage the participation of all interested parties in the competition that will lead to today's high-tech economy.  We commend this legislation for its strong and bipartisan support in the Senate and House Chambers and urge its adoption here today in the Senate. We think that we can all agree on a positive policy for good law enforcement.  Mr. President, the current anti-competitive foreign practices that have made United

Being from Texas, he is well-informed in this area, and to be given this insight to inform the Senate and to the American people is just an honor to be able to do this, to have the Senator offer it here today to help this Chamber come to an agreement. The President's statement earlier today coming from the State Department, in front of the world, and going back to the President of the United States himself as to the threat to this country is so strong and so definite that to not express this now is simply to ignore what has happened since the date of the compromise and which does take effect today.

Mr. President, this week I have the honor of recognizing Edgar E. Lewis of Golden Valley as he celebrates the 30th anniversary of his serving as the president of the Montana Landowners Association.  A leading figure in the battle for public land in Montana, Mr. Lewis worked diligently for more than 30 years to advance Montana's constitutional role of ownership, development and management of public lands. He was instrumental in helping establish and maintain Montana's public lands. He helped develop and preserve our state's scenic vistas, while insisting on a system of land ownership based on the values and needs of the communities in which we reside.  Mr. Lewis and Montana lost their independence in 1973 when Utah's Supreme Court ruled in the King v. Chenoweth case that the Montana Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of the State of Montana were to be

The legislation would establish a Federal program that would award the National Environmental Technology Program for innovative environmental technology development and advanced education initiatives in partnership with industry and the Federal Government.  These initiatives would focus on: improving technology for environmental control at the ground and in the air; improving the Nation's ability to integrate technologies in a more cost-effective manner to better meet environmental needs; preparing environmental technology firms for the future; developing innovative programs to reduce energy consumption and enhance economic performance at the local and State level; fostering a culture of environmental innovation and furthering the environmental agenda of our country.

Mr. President, this week, the Senate is having yet another debate on legislation to restrict access to abortion in this country, this time for women with a serious health risk such as a postpartum or postpartum auscultation. Senator Kennedy has offered the only bipartisan bill in this debate, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007, and it is about time that we hear the real stories of Lilly Ledbetter and other workers affected by pay discrimination.  Many women are told to hide behind pay discrimination as if they are somehow less than worthy of receiving equal pay. Many women are even given the false impression that their pay is so meager that they are untouchable.  Pay discrimination is unfair to all women and employees in the United States.

Mr. President, I have said many times that to say that food safety in this country is a national emergency means that our food safety systems are broken and cannot be fixed without bringing new resources to the system and forcing public participation and legislation. We have good intentions to make our food safe. But to say that a food safety crisis is a national emergency does not take into consideration that our food safety systems have not been tried to the extent they should be for decades now, especially if they are not in the most vulnerable and often the least accessible part of our food supply chain and why they have not been tested for toxic chemicals or contain them. Let me give one example in particular that says more about this issue than any other. That is a problem that was not properly addressed in the Food and Drug Administration under the Obama administration but that is
