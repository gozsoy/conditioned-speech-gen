Does the Senator feel the option of job vacancies that may be filled by H-1B visas is a very appropriate option in the national interest of this country? I must ask because, to the extent that I am hearing that the purpose is for H-1B visas for employer-sponsored visas in this country, if that option is available to holders of H-1B visas in other countries, does the Senator also feel it is appropriate and would he not prefer to have the option of employer-sponsored H-1B visas in the country which is in compliance with the provisions of the bill?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Timothy McDonald and Deb Schott, who both perished last month in the attacks of September 11, 2001. Two days earlier, I had the pleasure of traveling with Congressman Buyer and Congressman Skelton to Fort Hood in southern Texas to visit the soldiers stationed there and also helicopter pilots. I first visited Fort Hood, where I learned about Operation Enduring Freedom. The first act of the troops is actually to drive an armored Humvee into the Afghan-Iraqi market area where a car bomb exploded just a few months before.  Having seen the devastation of that attack and seeing the lives that were changed in America on that day when we visited with our men and women in uniform there, we understand that there is no guarantee in this city that the lives of any more Americans will never be changed

Madam President, I rise in support of S. 476, a bill I introduced 1 year ago to amend the Farm Credit Administration to provide for the establishment of a Conservation Reserve Fund to preserve private property for permanent public use and the reopening of the government's water for agriculture and energy development projects.  While there is much in this bill that I wish we were taking up now, it has taken a long time to put together. I am proud that on the first day of this Congress, the bill was unanimously supported by the Senate Agriculture Committee. The bill now has the support of over half of the 50 States, the National Governors Association, and more than 80 different agriculture organizations.  Our agricultural interests are threatened by the unsustainable and grossly inadequate use of Federal lands.  This bill is really a homecoming. Before I introduced it, I

This trip involved a lot of reflection and reflection and reflection on this country and what is so meaningful about this country and how enduring this journey is. It was a tour of a bit different nature. I wanted to do the first group of 19th century American Wright Brothers as an American aircraft carrier which stood at that time on the ground by the port of Cairo as we went through that beautiful city.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment strikes at a vital component of the legislation. It does so in two ways. It would result in the most open rules we have seen this year when it comes to the issue of whether contracts and fees be paid for by the Government or the private sector through the Department of the Interior or the Federal Government if that is the matter in question but that is not the fact. And I believe, and I think most Members do not believe, that is the case in Washington State and Pennsylvania and other States.  It strikes at the heart of the attempt to have the Federal Government of the United States protect us from this encroachment on private enterprise and commerce in the use of Federal lands by the Bureau of Land Management or the Corps of Engineers.

Madam President, today I honor a superb leader, intrepid warrior, and outstanding role model. Fifty years ago President Gerald Ford signed the Executive Order 15500 that named the President of the United States the first female Chief Executive officer of the United States Government and the first American woman elected to the highest office in the land. During this time of political and economic turmoil President Ford was able to move through difficult political battles and address issues head-on. President Everett Dirksen served as Secretary of State from 1977 to 1981 and Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1981 to 1983. While both administrations came and went, it is hard to think of a woman more impressive than Elizabeth Dole, who served from 1969 to 1971, as Vice President in the Reagan White House. Vice President Dole was a pioneer of the change that followed 9/11 and helped bring us

There is no State in the Nation that could be compared to Indiana because they make it as well and make it in Iowa and Wisconsin as Indiana Dakota.  It makes no sense.

I know of no better example of education reform than a tax cut that will help millions of students achieve a better quality education. Every American needs to be given the opportunity to attend the most expensive public schools in the Nation because failing to do so encourages students to transfer from these private, often very low-performing, public schools to lower-performing, often failing public schools. That is what we are debating here today.  In terms of accountability and value, the Federal Government is failing to provide public students with a quality education, and our Federal educational system is still too focused on helping parents with the paperwork required to get an education and to build a foundation for future success.

ExxonMobil will bring that back in record time. In the oil industry of this country, what kind of record does it beat? Not only a record of increased profits; it beat $127 million in earnings last year, and, according to ExxonMobil, its profits grew by 43 percent during that period.  Now the result of these lower oil prices has pushed more American households to pay higher oil bills for gasoline, even at the pump. The ExxonMobil win only underscores the obvious: the American people can't afford this.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of our final--our final--appropriations bill for this session of the Congress. It is now my hope that we will be able to approve the bill by voice vote.  It has been said that a good bill is hard to come by. I agree. It has been just the last 2 weeks that we have been in session since the President broke his fast by phone to ask for and then promptly gave the Murray-Bond bill a ``yes'' vote. However, if we are to truly have a bill to be able to go forward and pass this Senate, I believe that we need to begin voting on the bill immediately. That is not something that we can do overnight. That is the way that the Senate operates and, frankly, that is how we work in the Senate.  We had

Mr. Chairman, it takes $5 million from the DOT's Financial Management Capital account and puts it into the Small Business Growth Investment Fund in addition to what is already in the Small Business Administration system, for additional lending of $2 million to entrepreneurs and for additional lending to small businesses through the economic development administration program and for additional lending to small businesses through the economic growth program. The chairman said that only 10 percent of the small businesses that invest in venture capital are made up of women and minorities and that we need increase this number by 10 percent.  The reason why we need to increase this fund is because small businesses are the most vulnerable in our society. In the last few years there has been an explosion of entrepreneurial activity in this country, mostly in the subprime area. One in four venture capital funds in the United States are issued by minorities

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. I want to address a couple of important issues that have come up with regard to the Federal Government spending plan for fiscal year 2008 that will be presented by the administration for consideration in the Budget Committee later this week.  One thing that has become clear for many years now from this administration funding plan is that some priorities that they have put forth in that plan are not priorities that should be underfunded in the amount that they have proposed to those participants in the Medicare Program and Medicaid Program, not just those people who are presently part of Medicare or the Medicaid Program but those cynical people who are going to say that, well, we are now going to provide more tax credits for the wealthy, particularly the poorest, even though those are actually the people who are going to receive the most money

It has been said that the last time we saw this type of food prices rise was in 2005--more than 10 years ago. Now we have seen it rise almost 50 percent since 2007. As the administration tries to try to close this system down, the proposal of the Republican leadership is to spend a couple hundred billion dollars of cuts in food stamps to Wisconsin and other States in order to try to meet a $40 billion stimulus bill. The real stimulus bill that we need is $400 billion.  Our $40 billion plan, which would spend $300 billion and was enacted in the stimulus bill, is about half a trillion dollars, a half a trillion dollars that we should be trying to plan on how

The select few, like Staff Sergeant Allan Jay Kellogg from my State of Hawaii, who will return home from the war with a call to action and a sense of purpose for the future are a select group of their kind in the Nation of the United States of America. They are a testament to our military that we have as a country the very best that this country has to offer and that it is time that we did more to point out to people how much we appreciate them for it.  As far as I know, Allan is the only one of these lucky 100 that will return home from Iraq with a new sense of purpose in this country. There is no question, he will be heartened to know that his own son also gave his life for our country and for our freedom, for America and freedom.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Now the plan to return the increase that went to the students has been taken out of a program that has increased the opportunity for students and their families for a long time now in this country to have that education at a much more reasonable cost than they did when they went to college five years ago. It is a program that is called IDEA. It is a program that provides opportunities for students and their families to be able to afford a college education. It is a program which has gotten 85 percent of the money back from individuals for education. It is called a tax credit, an up-front tax credit for the students and their families. It is a program that actually helps students graduate and they can go to college and they can get a college education

We got into this first year of the administration and we really did not come in the very worst shape. The economy was doing well and we had this crisis in Iraq which was devastating the disaster area that was impacted on.  We realized the Congress had got to focus on the priorities that the American people believe in.

Let me say that I agree that our bill is a bipartisan effort that Congress has made to try to improve and make our country stronger and more secure. But I want to point out one provision in the legislation that has a substantial adverse effect on economic growth in the United States of America. That is the export tax surplus provision. I am referring to the provision in the bill that eliminates the $75 million earned tax credit for port-related goods exports. That credit is essentially designed to encourage small business export expansion. It is one of the things that allows us to compete internationally and to export.

It is our job as deficit hawks in this Chamber to look for cuts that will actually reduce spending cuts in other spending cuts as well as cuts that we believe are recession-proof. It is important to understand the budget rules of the Senate. I want to set a record straight for my colleagues.  My vote today is simple. Our budget assumes all of the President's budget. Our budget cuts spending. Our budget adds tax relief for middle-income Americans. Our budget taxes wealth, pays down the debt, increases productivity, invests in education, breaks out our deficits, and provides tax relief for military families.  By the way

This morning I had the opportunity to talk to the police chief about a story of a young woman who was just robbed in her own home in the heart of Davenport, IA. On a warm spring day, five armed men barged in and took a gun from the police chief and her husband's safe. The manager later showed the chief the burglary kit. The officers retrieved and removed dozens of handguns and 9 mm ammunition. They took, but didn't find the victim. This kind of crime does not happen in other communities across the country, and this crime is on the rise.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule, which regrettably precludes Republicans from offering commonsense reforms to the effort to cut the Federal budget. The Speaker has said that there will be a majority for the first time since Congress broke for a 6-week recess in August to raise the minimum wage, but we are likely to be met with a freeze in the wage floor. Now that Democrats have taken the majority, it is clear that their priority will be to balance the Federal budget on the backs of working families.  I believe in common sense and stand ready to offer amendments to H.R. 1170 that will provide for a real reduction in the cost of living index. But today we are in the worse economic times than we were in the early 1980's, with the economy in the grips of a deep recession. And

I will always cherish the family's memory of him and I join them in his memory.  Like his brother and many of us, my family and I moved to the United States in 1946 and in the years since he has lived and worked in the academy of civics and was a member of the NAACP. He worked for the last decade in Philadelphia as an assistant for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, my colleague, the Honorable Robert Latta. We were very fortunate to have him to call our home.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2237, as amended, the Helping Our Older Americans Use Electronic Devices Act of 2010 to modernize our important Federal programs for seniors with disabilities. This bill was introduced by our friend and colleague Congressman Hinchey of New York and was unanimously approved by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Speaker Ryan's first day in the new Congress last November. This bill is important not only because it includes the system of regulations that we are creating for the next generation, but also because of the ways in which this bill advances the interests of our senior citizens and their ability to use electronic devices in the future.  The system that we have established to ensure the orderly transition of our elderly with disabilities from home to

I have said this morning that it is my hope that we will be able to do it as soon as we have the chance tomorrow night so we can move this as quickly as we can today. It is because of a number of factors, not the least of which is the situation where we have some of the country's sick people that could get infected infected virus and they could not get out of this country.  Now, if we cannot do that, it is an embarrassment, not only to Congress, to the medical community that did what they did, but to the American people who all want to do something about it.

The previous vote was a no vote on the previous amendment by the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Hastings]. There is a common thought out there that the American people do not like working for special special interests or special groups in Washington. Well in this country they do not like special groups missions.  This is not about protecting special interests. This is not about protecting bureaucrats in the bureaucracy. This is not about protecting special interests. This is about ending corporate welfare, in which the taxpayers of this country receive vast amounts of corporate subsidies.

The Center for Immigration Studies, I say to my colleague from Florida [Mr. Weldon], studies the question of Florida raising Arizona's citizen tax not because we do not believe the law should be to provide incentives to help State and local governments respond to the need of State and local governments but rather because this program is already a State and local program in Florida where it works. The University of Florida used it as a model program for the year 2000. We encourage our States and localities to spend money to help State and local governments deal with increasing demand for legal services, dealing with increasing requests from States and localities and dealing with the more urgent problem that we have with our people who are citizens today, and we are sure that this will serve that purpose.

Mr. President, last week President Clinton announced a sweeping welfare reform plan that will make welfare work for low-income parents, not for criminals and junkies.  The new Federal welfare plan, which is estimated to cost taxpayers up to $400 billion over the next 5 years, will not only reward States and localities for being good partners in welfare, it will also create new incentives for States to seek the welfare of needy children.  The new law will also encourage States to help children become self-sufficient by making welfare payments conditional on satisfactory employment and education.

The establishment and protection of a National Guard is long overdue and I believe our Nation is better served by the presence of these tremendous American forces in our communities and around our great Nation than they are by the relationship between the United States and our friends and neighbors to our friendship and to our safety in their places of birth.  The New Jersey National Guard have demonstrated the resiliency and strength of our nation since our early days in the great war. The very first national guardsmen and women to be trained were the Yorktown Irregulars, the Knights of Columbus, and many others. The recognition that they were being trained at the famed Golden Gate

Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering on behalf of myself and my colleague from New York [Mr. Walsh] concerns an area that should be fully debated and an area that should be properly developed and should be properly funded by the Department of Defense, but that the American people should have safety in numbers. The proposed amendment on behalf of the gentlemen from California and Massachusetts would require the head of the United States Military Installations Corporation to fund an electric shock wire to rescue several marines that were washed ashore when their helicopter crashed during a massive cargo transport operation at sea carrying trucks full of cement kilns.  I have heard these stories and others about the experience that the American people are facing as a result of the terrible disasters that we have been engaged in around the world for many years.

Mr. Chairman, I am a traditionalist. My entire life's environment and upbringing have created within me a respect for the strong relationship between father and son and family and marriage as a unique institution and as a particular step in the relationship between man and woman. With that very conservative position comes a firm conviction that our Founding Fathers did not intend for our legal institutions and legal systems to be developed and become partner-in-crime with the judiciary.  I have just reflected on what I consider to be the vital role of the courts. Just to give a context of that period in the American history, the first judicial review of the content of government was made a few years before the Civil War, and in 1809, Justice Thurgood Marshall, a Federal magistrate, the founding Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, came out with an

For the first time since 1950 this measure lowered the cost of employment for low-income individuals and households while yielding billions of dollars in additional revenues to the Treasury, enabling the government to spend that money on things like education and infrastructure.  One can argue that the minimum wage increase was the right thing to do.

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the bottom line here and the reason that I believe the bill should not pass is that the so-called safety net has been cheapened in some ways for the housing insurance program to provide this big money for them in terms of affordable housing. We are at a point in our economic recovery that deals with the costs of rebuilding damaged buildings and the costs of the higher income of this country, and so the premium that the people who are covered under this program pay goes way up, which means that they are doing the minimum to live in safe housing and they pay some amount in terms of taxes in terms of the housing program that provides that safety net. That does not make the market function under this system a good thing. It just does not make the market function.  It is our responsibility in our constitutional

Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks in support of H.R. 621, I do want to take just a moment to give a personal note in behalf of my good friend from Washington. A lot of people talk about some experience that I have had on that tragic day and how much I have learned over the years and how much I have worked for more than 20 years to foster civil rights.  I do not like to think of myself as a politician. That might be like me watching the Congress on television and hearing all the talk about this great country and all the talk about these amazing people that come here and speak up and speak up. I do not like that at all. But this was a country that said: If you wanted the chance for something to happen, you did not get it; you were either going to get it or

It is a question of fact as to what Senator Sessions would really do in his judgment as a matter of fair consideration of the whole concept of the need to deal with these cost-benefit and this brings up an issue of perception as to what is the policy on this particular subject, to be able to understand the agreement we have reached, the agency in effect, the Federal Health Service Act, in which it is written, has made its statement.

Mr. President, this amendment would unfairly rescind building and facilities money that was finally committed in the highway bill passed last year by the Senate in a bipartisan way and signed into law by the President this time around when he had the chance to act and when he finally acted before we even had the vote on it. That amendment is based on what some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have referred to as building equipment and facilities.  The way the procedure works is we first review the spending levels in previous years. If we have in any one instance requested funding for transportation programs, then we recommend the very same type of facilities, the same type of building equipment, and the very same type of facilities as in the previous years.

This bill has overwhelming bipartisan support from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the public in this country which makes this issue one which we should all support.  The rise of the social justice movement in this country has resulted in an explosion in housing which is unprecedented. From smaller houses, to communities with a larger concentration of housing, to homes built in colonial and post colonial times, the people have spoken in strong support of the idea that poverty does not have to be a disadvantage.  Housing for minorities across this country has been viewed as a means by which to strengthen themselves as a nation. This practice has fueled the dramatic transformation of society throughout our history. A great number

I appreciate the question from my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky. To achieve water rights management in Arizona and in the State of the National Parks, it is very important that the Land and Water Conservation Fund be applied in a way that takes into account the area which has the most land use and the most wildlife so that the State has the right to get the most return for the center of the pie. The concern I have about using this land for grazing and our discussions about how we should address that particular thing is that this land may experience floods and wildfire that could consume precious water resources, that could be catastrophic for other citizens in the valley.  The legislation before us does not respond to those kinds of problems because it removes some protections that have been given by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It denies this to the people of Arizona

For Senator Obama's role in working out these final compromises with the House, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute.  Over the last year and a half, we have balanced a number of important priorities for both Senators on the Republican side and for the Congress on the Democratic side. We have provided significant increases in Federal spending for the VA, education, job training and biomedical research, and provided generous increases in funding for Medicaid and Title X.

Madam Chair, this amendment designates $100,000 in funding to the United States Geological Survey so that it may conduct a study of the potential of earthquakes in Arizona and along the Arizona-Mexico border. As the Chair knows, in Arizona there are hundreds of earthquakes yearly, most of which are magnitude 5 and smaller. In the Tucson area, earthquakes can strike at any time of the year or geological fault lines will develop, thus creating numerous catastrophic hazards.  The Arizona State University is well known throughout the State for its expertise in earthquake research and geophysics as well as in Connecticut and Oregon, including the Pacific Northwest.  Madam Chair, there are currently no plans in place to respond to any of these earthquakes, as they are catastrophic. However, Arizona and Arizona's senior citizens have shown incredible resilience in coping with these catastrophic events.

And my friend from Pennsylvania was talking about how each of us in this body, when we were part of our political families have spent our lives as debtors of this country and how we do what we can to reduce that debt. There is nothing that our generation can do to save this country of ours when we come up to the moment where we sacrifice so much and make so much sacrifice to pay for other people's problems that we will have no idea how much more we are going to cost the people of this country the affects of our actions when we become a democracy.  I think it is a little amazing that there is no plan to deal with our debt. There are millions and millions of people in this country who are not afraid of going to a job. They are afraid of the debt. They are

Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. Last year I voted for the reauthorization, and I must say that this reauthorization is an important reform. I will vote for the health care reform conference report this week to help improve the program, to make it work better for the many working families in this country who are on the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, the committee that authorizes health care in this country.  In contrast, I think the health care reform conference report represents a poorly-designed piece of legislation that will provide great hurt to a great number of children who will have no insurance.  First of all, what is the law? There is no enforcement. There is no legal obligation. This will be funded entirely by other means. The private sector will

Mr. Chairman, the decision to ban snowmobiles from the roads of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is a difficult one for me and all of us here in Congress who believe in the important role of public land for recreation and environmental protection in our Nation. As Chairman Huizenga has pointed out in a statement here today, the decision to ban snowmobiles from the roads of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is not based on cost-benefit analysis or environmental protection policies but because the agency chose not to enter into the administration proposal for this new mandate for Clinton-era snowmobiles.  However, although the reauthorization is flawed, I think it is a real misimpression to think that snowmobiles are not a strong, popular, and popular event for the people of Montana, especially the 50,000 or

First of all, these funds are directly related to efforts to prevent illegal immigration in our ports of entry and to bring illegal immigrants to our country for any other work they want to do while dollars are dedicated to securing our ports of entry. The Coast Guard uses this money to wage attacks against narcotics, human trafficking, and human smuggling operations along our ports of entry.

I am just getting wound up. They referred to America after the Second World War as a ``golden age,'' and now the United States of America is being accused of being the age of the American nuclear bomber. This is the age that the Senator talked about, the age of the bomber, but it was the age of the bombs that we were running before they were built and the age of the bombers that we are running now. You go back to before World War II when we aisle rewrote the whole engineering structure of the United States of America, and the yield of the Ford F-4 was 5 million pounds, the yield of the Wright Brothers' aeroplane was 6 to 7 million pounds. The Ford F-4 was the equivalent of an American missile, carrying the three engines, and the most powerful bomb,

The Defense of Marriage Act is an affront to our fundamental due process and equality rights. It is a constitutional assault on our Nation's fundamental belief in the sanctity of marriage. It denies gays and lesbians the fundamental protection that is guaranteed to everyone else under our Constitution.

I have also worked to require funding in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) antidrug training and control programs to combat anti-Semitism and hate crimes.

That is correct.

There are other ways in which these kinds of things are done that are quite similar to these kinds of large corporate tax breaks in Oregon as well as several other States including the District of Columbia and many others.

We spoke earlier about the fact that we have a moral obligation to make sure that the new generation is prepared to address the future challenges in this country that the question before this Congress is whether we will debate in the future, as we should debate every issue concerning health care reform and welfare reform and education reform and the environment reform legislation, substantive issues, or whether we are going to make the mistake of simply spending trillions of dollars on something we can ill afford.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Solomon amendment. Mr. Chairman, in my analysis, this amendment is not based on States rights but just simply my understanding that if you insist on those opposed to the amendment saying these things, then they must have been absolutely explicit that if they felt your legislation was going too far and you were going too fast and so on and so forth and in very general terms as opposed to carefully focusing in on specific public policy issues, then they had to be absolutely clear that they were supporting this bill.  The fact of the matter is that this bill does not make that clear in any way. This bill makes the arguments clearly, yet very selectively, to the State's interests and to the decision-making process that has already been established in advance of the adoption of the legislation.

And so I would like to take just a few minutes to try to put the Senate on record for working on a bill that does not allow for filibuster and does not give up any Republican amendments.  This is a bill the Senate Republicans passed unanimously in November. It protects abortion. We were doing our job. I think we set the stage. It prevents the government shutdown that began the last time. It calls for real progress on the minimum wage, which hasn't come close to a raise in 6 years.

That, in and of itself, is a subsidy. Let's be honest.

It does nothing to help create more jobs in our communities. We can fix that and get honest numbers on that. If that's going to be the number we're talking about, if the taxes and fees are subsidized, the environment and the American people are going to pay the price.

Madam Speaker, I submit for the Record an editorial by David Broder, Friday, November 13, 1996, in the Financial Times of London, this week noting that the administration is headed toward an embarrassing moment on tax policy.

He quotes from a Republican spokesman who says the bill ``is a job killer for the middle class and would only benefit those who can most afford it from the Walker-Chabot provision of cutting taxes for corporations and the rich.''

Had I been present for that event the Federal debt of $5 million would be in balance, notwithstanding the legislation I have introduced with Senators Kerrey and Harkin entitled the Peace Officers Safety Enhancement Act.  Mr. President, at the request of Senator Coburn, I will undertake the privilege and solemn obligation of enumerating my unavoidable absence for the purpose of attending the tribute to the late Robert F. Kennedy, the 14th President of the United States. It is with great honor and humility that I pay tribute to the extraordinary life of this Nation

I noticed the Senator had read through President Clinton's speech earlier today when he spoke of Bill Clinton and economic growth in America. I believe Senator Clinton said economic growth has been ``a Republican economic policy for the last 30 years.'' He said that for 10 years economic growth has been a Republican economic policy for the last three decades and he added economic growth has been a Republican economic policy since World War II because economic growth economy is the whole program.  Senator Clinton made two points, the one he made earlier today is very interesting, and then we heard another comment he made, which I thought I would point out: President Clinton will get out of this slump very soon.

I appreciate its intent to improve the management of Federal court resources and to allow Federal judges to make personal use of their judicial powers.  I applaud Senator Rockefeller and his leadership as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee on judicial reform and arrogance to discharge the Senate's role as a deliberative body in this bill. In this new reform world, having this necessary judicial reform bill on the floor is of critical importance.

But the part of the bill that the Senator from Arizona did not vote for was the tax cut for the so-called special interest that the Democrats would have us to vote for on this bill if we ended this special interest tax break for the rich. The author of the substitute wanted this tax break for the rich. He said--well, he said that this was to cut corporate taxes, and if it didn't, somehow the rich should go back to having to pay income taxes.

Both were said to be a study of the economics of electricity and of the economics of a university professor in New York who lives near and interacts with a huge electrical company.  I think the first idea is a real eye-opener for the House of Representatives, to find out how you set yourself up to fail as a State and the Nation by passing so many rules that simply cannot comply with it, by having their knowledge about physics and electricity treated as if it was not available, even though it

The Union League Club is known around the Nation for its contributions to African-American athletes. It is the oldest black-owned professional club in the United States and actively participates in league and commendation contests. In 1972, the league organized an integrated league schedule and has operated since. Its participation in these competitions helps to grow their membership and demonstrate their membership's strength and of their dedication to improving the lives of African-Americans.  According to the Union League Club, the African-American pool has increased from 250,000 in 1972 to more than 12 million in the 1970's. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the United States now has the third largest African

But the other point I would like to make here is that the New York Times this morning, and this is from their press release a couple of weeks ago in fact yesterday in the Washington Post said this about the previous injuries, they are continuing to use that even though we are closing the hospitals, because we are still providing about $6 billion in additional money for hospitals, they are still using this as a fallback.

They need to have the chance to fulfill that dream. They need to have the hope that they can fulfill that dream if they make it their goals and they have the opportunity to do it. We have to give them the resources to have that dream.

I just cannot do it. We should not do it. It is an inequity in our society, in our laws, in our immigration system, to let people simply go through

Essential for America to have a successful economic future for the next generation and for our children to get jobs in their paychecks, let alone get on their way to the next century of our country.  And yet Republicans in this House have yet to consider any of these provisions because they are all taken away in this so-called energy bill because of the same kind of politics that shut out the so-called energy legislation because the so-called bill effectively spends the tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country.

In 2002, at least one million people were sickened by tainted meat sold in America's supermarkets and restaurants. That should be an item of concern to all of us because it is not only food that can buy its way into the hands of someone sick--fat globules, bat guano--it also comes from those whose lives have been touched by tainted meat or poultry. Even the highest quality meat in the United States is probably tainted in one way or another.
