Does the Senator feel the option of job vacancies that may be filled by H-1B visas under this program is some additional incentives to be seeking American workers in other countries because we want to encourage more people to come to the United States because we think this will be a better option for American workers who may not qualify under a Government-sponsored program like a visa to enter the United States?   Premier Ehlers at a joint press conference with Senator Johnston suggested that the purpose of the legislation was to increase American employers' leverage to remain in the United States by the granting of a limited number of visas to those who are qualified to fill these jobs. We have a requirement under the existing H-1B visa that the employer must pay a fee equal to 85 percent of the cost of the worker's skills or training, but the job offered

During this tragedy two of our daughters, a 2-year-old and 5-year-old had to watch over their daddy for a week because the vehicle with which he was traveling broke down and crashed into a pond that had been newly planted in the neighborhood.  Just this month, a father and son who were living in my district were also killed in a vehicle crash in Lubbock, Texas. I know the loss and grief the members of the Texas Air National Guard suffered from this tragic accident.

While this legislation is another attempt by the Senate to improve the law, we still have much to do in order to enact effective environmental and resource conservation policies within the Department of the Interior as the Federal Government continues to purchase Government-owned land.

But the courts have been proceeding without this provision for almost a decade and have continued to use it to undercut and delay courts and administrative agencies when it comes to interpreting laws and court decisions and rules and the like.

Madam Speaker, tomorrow the United States House of Representatives will vote to borrow $75 billion from foreign banks to finance a tax cut for the wealthy. The House Republican plan cuts taxes for the 1.5 million people who get the biggest tax breaks from the Bush tax cut, the richest Americans. That is what the wealthiest people get from this plan. So this is a Republican tax cut that will help the 1.5 million people who get the biggest tax cut in our history. That is really just a dream because this tax cut is going to cost more money to pay for because it will cost us more money to provide the tax breaks that the rich get from the Bush tax cut and the administration wants to give them. It is the American way. It is a democratic way to deal with a budget problem when the American people have been asked

I want to take this opportunity to speak in the strongest possible terms in support of this very important bill which I believe will make a significant contribution to the future of America's economy, and to our national security as well. This bill is as important a measure as any that we may vote on this week. The fact that this bill has passed the House and the Senate by overwhelming margins is proof that we in Congress understand that the problem we have is national security-related.

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, the pending amendment would say that the fund shall have its use after the close of fiscal year 1996 and that it may be used for general and other purposes for the fiscal year 1997 budget submission. The chairman of the committee stated that this change was not part of the fiscal year 1995 budget request and therefore was not included in the bill which we are considering today. I think that the chairman of the full committee made that statement and made it in good faith. It was the committee's intent to include the change in the two competing accounts in the budget request because it will be necessary in the future to continue to work with the members of the committee and the public as to how best to address these important issues in the appropriations process. It also should be noted that the committee

This particular amendment today would make sure that loans would be from the highest interest rate to the lowest interest rate which we have and that it is calculated accurately. If we want to double up the growth in Federal loan limits, we will not be able to do that, but by changing the math we can make sure that we get a lower bill.

Madam Speaker, this afternoon the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity of the Committee on Financial Services held a hearing entitled ``Addressing the Mortgage Crisis in the United States.'' While there have been many positive efforts to address the mortgage crisis in the United States, one of the critical ways we can help ease this economic downturn and preserve and protect homeownership opportunities for our families is by increasing home ownership among our youth.  I know that I speak for many on both sides of the aisle when I say that we need to provide help to help many families and to provide housing opportunities to families. Unfortunately, this crisis does not just affect families across the country, it affects all children. For instance, over 75 percent of disadvantaged children receive assistance through a school project grant program. Likewise, more than 8 million homes available to families now do not have

Mr. Chairman, I would point out to the Chair that we do not have a chance to debate the amendment on the overall cost-of-living-adjustment that is in the overall bill. But I just want to point out that there are several points that I would like to make with the Representative that I can at this time indicate the process that we are using for our committee to obtain all of the information that we need.  Mr. Chairman, the provisions of the substitute that was developed, for example, allow for a period of time for us to reach into the industry and to gain the information that the industry needs to make sure that the private companies do not have to pay any more than what is provided to the government.  The second point that I would want to make about the provision that is in the substitute is

I have been a strong supporter of the troops and their families through my service in the House and my time in the U.S. Senate. But as Iraq and Afghanistan show more and more evidence that this war has been a military failure, I have serious concerns about our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and about the mission they are assigned to carry out.

We have seen that all over the country and across the country in 1993 and in 1994.

Mr. Speaker, from 2001 to 2006, the cost of higher education exploded in this country. Every day that passed without making any change in this country was not enough time to make a difference in the lives of the students who are graduating today and those that are in their forties or fifties who want to enter the 21st century workforce and earn a great future for themselves and their families in this great country of the United States of America.  That is why it is so important for this Congress to make a change in the way in which we have been spending the funds of the Federal Government to the states of this country. We have already taken a look at a number of different programs for education and have seen the current situation that we are in in that education is at a new low in this country. A minimum of 1 million students

Mr. President, on this side, we have run the hot line for the last 30 years of the time line for a single final bill which we have had a chance to hold up and vote on today because the leadership in the House and in the Senate, and the chairman of the Budget Committee of the House and the ranking member of the Budget Committee of the Senate have simply dropped all the time lines and there has been a straight up-or-down vote on this legislation, and the result has been a reduction in the deficit in $4.5 billion over a 5-year period and nearly $3 trillion over a 10-year period, not a cut at all as they have suggested in the past. It is a new approach to the way Government should be run, and if we would have had an up

Madam Chairman, this is a thoughtless and destructive amendment. I strongly oppose the underlying bill that Republicans are pushing through Congress today. H.R. 5385 would permit military recruitment companies to pay the living costs of welfare recipients without the benefit of compensation to the families. No compensation to the families of welfare recipients which is not paid to the troops to give them the skills that they need to pay their own way.  Let us deal with real issues of merit and value and deal with them while protecting the welfare of our children. Those are the fundamental values which we should be fighting for on the House floor today.  At this time I reserve the balance of my time.   Grayson Owens, Washington, DC.    Hon.

We have heard from many small businesses and the nation at large that the tax treatment of their business income, and the onerous and burdensome requirements and roadblocks they face in trying to do so, are truly barriers to their success in being successful. We have also heard from some small businesses that they have found it increasingly difficult to keep their doors open by the hundreds of millions of dollars that they are required to pay in various taxes and interest, and by not being able to offer tax reductions for individuals and for families with the additional expense of

The Soviets declared Lithuania a non-independent state on April 7, 1920, and Lithuania is a Baltic country still joined to the Soviet Union by two important border posts in July 1920 and July 31 of that year. Since the early 1980s, this year's celebration will take place on August 1. The year of its birth marked the beginning of a period in which Lithuania made great strides in terms of its economy and in terms of its political independence, while also being the birthplace of the Soviet Union.

The Farm Credit Administration, for example, is one of the few programs that is in place that does not have a direct impact on one industry that is vital to the American farmer and that is the farmers of this country. The fact that it is a low-interest loan program means that farmers do not have to risk their money when they have to move overseas to export their products overseas.

As many of my colleagues know, I am a strong supporter of defense programs and I believe defense should be fully funded at a level that makes sense to this Nation and to our military leaders. The current level of defense spending does not meet that standard and Congress must find a more appropriate means to meet this challenge. I have long believed that President Clinton's current Defense Appropriations request for fiscal year 1996 and for fiscal year 1997 makes it necessary to freeze these spending levels.  I am also concerned that the current level of defense spending will actually expire as a result of the budget resolution of the House of Representatives on the

They get a rebate under the earned income credit, as the Senator from Tennessee knows. Under the Senate version of the budget plan, the people that are in the poorest families and those people that have the most at risk are the people that are going to benefit the most from the earned income tax credit. In the case of a middle-class family that is going to have to spend more money just to get by and to keep the lights on and water heaters on, the earned income tax credit is going to be there to help them out, and it is going to be tax credit to them. That is why I support this version of the budget.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

We will not ask for a unanimous-consent request under the Senator's amendment. That will not be necessary. What we have to do is make an agreement we will be allowed to have some debate on that amendment and then after that will be voted on. We will not ask for anything beyond that that we will have debate on, but we are going to stay with that proposal we have for our time at this time. That will be offered for the whole week, even though we will be going back to the 11 o'clock meeting, I believe.

The work of this House should be one of ensuring that our public servants are working together in the most efficient and effective manner possible. One of the important elements of any civil service is the necessity of support for the fellow officers and employees of the service. This House, in fact, we all honor the service of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee by providing a significant $400 million increase in the bill for him and his staff, and that is in part to offset the expenses of those operations and salaries that have been brought to bear on this oversight over the last few months. The chairman has done an outstanding job in providing for the interest of the Committee, and I commend him on his performance.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation

Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Yesterday, the Finance Committee held a hearing on H.R. 5587, the Alaska Energy Tax Act. After much work, bipartisan agreement was reached on the Committee's energy tax legislation. This legislation provides an important opportunity for us to reflect on and enact legislation that is both long overdue and is clearly the most environmentally sustainable way of producing energy for our country.  The State of Alaska is undergoing a renewable energy revolution and I was pleased to hear that the bill before the Senate today would provide substantial incentives to state-run utilities and other commercial and industrial generators. As we continue to focus on economic development, I believe it is important that we provide incentives to energy-generating facilities.

The National Defense Authorization Act that passed the House on February 28 is going to extend military construction contracts until April of next year. Now, it would be well-advised for Congress to support these funding levels that we approved last year. Why do Congress members want to do this and why would you want to do that when the administration is telling us that the current funding level that Congress voted for last year will not be enough to meet the demands of our military and construction projects this year.

It would strike the ``fair and balanced'' approach that the administration has taken to the economic sanctions we have imposed against Chinese currency manipulation.  This administration has rightly, I believe, shown that it is fully committed to protecting American jobs and our economy. But it seems that some are getting ahead of themselves here. It seems that today the administration has decided that it will do more to leverage an economic war than to prevent it. The Economic Recovery and Growth Act did not hurt the economy of America's manufacturing sector. Now we are using the China currency manipulation problem as a bargaining chip to do worse than nothing.  I have been particularly concerned about the number of economists

I also want to thank Senator Mack for his statement of the American people that Republicans have worked on this legislation for 20 years. He said when I was in the House in 1993 that Republicans in the House and the Senate will finally be able to pass legislation that will help millions of Americans in this country, not only those with health insurance but Americans of all income levels who are poor and many without health insurance today. I am looking forward to finally passing this legislation today and looking forward to another decade of cooperation on a piece of legislation that will help millions of Americans in this country. We have been going at it for years and years and years. Senator Mack and I have made it a priority to help millions of Americans with

But just as we need to make sure that when people have the opportunity to vote that the only thing that they should be denied is a justifiably unprincipled effort to go around the laws of the country in order to gain the support of the people who vote in those elections so that they can take them back out of that voting system so that they can then have that vote counted in their own neighborhood and in their own State and that will ensure that the same kind of

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule, which regrettably precludes Republicans from offering a continuing resolution to keep our Government running and our country safe. This continuing resolution bill is a blueprint for a government shutdown of the worst kind, one that threatens the safety of our citizens and the economy. I would submit that the Republicans would never bring this up under normal circumstances, but under the rules that we have before us they can still do so because they can use the threat of a continuing resolution to further their plan to punish Democrats who will not vote to fund government. Even more harmful to our Nation is the efforts made by Speaker Gingrich to force Congress to provide gifts to the President so that he can pay for his own party's historic tax cuts for the rich.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a native Pennsylvanian. Today we honor what was once known as North Bridge Church of the Suburban Byways in Silver Spring, Maryland. More than a century ago, Reverend Robert Thomas Jones of the North Bridge Church in Philadelphia was killed in action in Mexico in the famous Battle of the Alamo. During that time he lived in an apartment located on the east side of his family home.  Mr. Jones was born into a middle-class family in Maryland and attended Christian School in Silver Spring and later came to work for the Suburban Byways, a Jewish school for middle school children. While working for the Suburban Byways, Mr. Jones developed a profound love of the arts and music, which he brought back with him to the area. In a short period of time he was

This important legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to establish a land exchange for the National Park System in the State of Nevada, the opening of a great cultural and historic site to the general public in the Reno area.  The National Park Service has been looking for sites to be acquired for some time, but it has not yet found the home for this big-spending special ed. It is critical that this resource be sold as soon as possible so that we can give communities in Nevada all that they need in order to support their future. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance

The child support enforcement provisions in this bill are critical to supporting working families and job creation. Not only do these provisions address serious human services issues facing children, but they also protect children in this country from scams that may be harmful to them, such as the operation of an agency which means there is no protection to the private property rights of the children.  Child support enforcement has long been a responsibility of the Federal Government and has been a matter of bipartisan cooperation and compromise in both Houses of the Congress for over 60 years.

It is more expensive to create this situation than we are now providing that support in terms of the process of doing so for our country and for our taxpayers here in this Congress.

It is a vote for responsible spending.  As a current member of the Ethics Committee, I understand the need to limit the budget of the independent expenditure committees in this legislation and would support that desire and would support the effort of the majority to prohibit direct contributions to such committees in the House budget. However, I believe that the individual spending limitation should be a product of the laws and budgets of both the House and the Senate and that all such laws should be subject to the same funding cap in this legislation.

Let me emphasize that discretionary spending is, in my judgment, the wrong focus of this debate, because it focuses on agencies which do not know how much they need. We have added hundreds of billions of dollars to the National Park System, many of which did not come from Congress but were borrowed from the country. Those who claim that this is how we have to allocate our limited resources are simply using numbers that they know are not accurate.  Mr. President, I think it is best that we tell the truth about what we need. We need spending for the war in Afghanistan, the homeless, and things like that; but what we cannot control is that our spending is

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the new 104th Congress launched a new beginning, a new spirit of Congress and leadership in America and the world by approving and passing the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. This bill includes most of the critical funding necessary for our nation's security. While many of the key components of this bill have not been fully implemented yet, I am proud that this milestone has been achieved by the Congress and the administration. There is much more work to be done to maintain the commitment to our Nation's military and to the veterans of the armed services. While I would like to spend a greater amount of time talking about these needs, I would like to briefly discuss just some of the larger provisions of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill for the year 1997 and talk about some of the contributions made by the leadership

The United Nations Special Envoy for Children and Women in Human Rights provides two functions in the United States: one in promoting the rights of children in the course of a resolution of a serious international conflict to which the United States has a legitimate interest; and another in promoting human rights in the course of a resolution of an international conflict that occurs at the United Nations or when a member nation of the United Nations performs its national responsibilities under the

Mr. President, an old Chinese proverb says: ``If you do not pay the doctor who treats you, you will not get sick.'' The truth is that we should be paying our doctors in much the same way we pay our health care providers today. The bipartisan bipartisan Fixing America's Health Care Act will ensure that in the future we will pay our health care providers, and the Medicare trustees have told us we should ensure that we do. The reform that we are proposing will force both sides of the payment equation to deal with the same issues, with the understanding that we pay our health care providers in the same way that we pay our hospital providers, our doctor, our hospital system, and Medicare. It is a fundamental principle that if we do not fix the Medicare Payment Reform Act, we are going to see the great health care guarantee that

While some will dispute that the situation in Iraq has improved to the point that the United States should acknowledge Iraq's contribution to peace and stability in the Middle East, the result of this respect is a shift in the perception of what it means to be an American government and to contribute to the good that is good for the region and

It would require that the vehicle should be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition so that the driver would have safety when leaving the vehicle at the fuel station.

Only 13 percent of all spending of the U.S. Government has been deficit neutral over the past 20 years. This 7-year plan was agreed to by virtually every Member of the House of Representatives in 1989 and 1995. In those years we have reduced Federal spending $24 billion more than what was spent during the 10 years of the plan from 1993 to 1993 and $10 billion more than the 10 years in which that plan was in effect.  Some of those cuts were made by allowing States to implement their own mandatory minimum penalties to pay for Federal funds for treatment

The Acting Solicitor General's role in this proceeding is clearly the one that is most focused on consumer concerns and consumer protection. The provision would be particularly destructive to Members of the House, particularly as we consider offering House bills to address these issues when we return this body.

Mr. Chairman, I recognize that the Territory of the Virgin Islands does not have a State capital. However, there is no law or restriction which prevents the jurisdiction of the State to impose the land exchange tax of 10 percent on property which is used as a retail or office establishment. I do not think that the Government should in any way impose an economic tax on the private sector that is intended to increase revenue to the Government and thus, to allow the Territory to reduce spending.  I would also note that there is an economic reason for this 10 percent tax on retail and office establishments as an economic stimulus measure because such establishments are responsible for over 60 percent of the economy in the United States. Thus, the economic consequences of a 10 percent tax would be deleterious to the economy as a whole and would have an adverse effect on the

There are those who say it is OK that the consumer is forced to buy a new product without knowing what kind of product they are buying so that the consumer can have confidence and be more likely to make decisions on their own rather than having to buy something that could damage their health or their safety and their consumer welfare and therefore affect their business in the future

Facial recognition technology for the American driver is critical to preventing the increased number of drunk driving accidents that we have seen in recent years because these are the drivers most likely to be able to blend in with the population and not be in the spotlight and immediately risk a crash that will cause more money in potential liability. Therefore we would be well served to increase the funding in this bill and to the people of Massachusetts to increase the efforts that they have already made on this issue to improve the safety of the community and to get these areas out of the spotlight so we can prevent more of the costly and most devastating drunk-driving accidents from occurring in the first place.   temporal and visual tracking of our cars and other devices is needed to protect the public and State.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation to repeal section 434 of the recently enacted Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 that limits the collection of unemployment compensation under the 10-year budget option. This is important for many reasons, the most immediate being that the original intent of the section was to limit the 10-year budget options to three year projections and to increase the maximum in 2001 by $25 million in order to ensure a 7-year budget option. However, the House of Representatives, under the leadership of the chairman of the Budget Committee, and with the cooperation of the Senate and the White House, has decided to postpone the effective date of section 434 for 6 months until February 2002 in order to permit for the budget reconciliation conference to take place in March 2002 and January 2003.

They just want to get their hands around a completely hopeless economic situation, and they will do just that unless and until they get one Republican Democrat in the White House who will sign their regulatory repeal legislation. I do not know why that is important. But that is exactly what we're going to get from this Congress unless the hard-working men and women in this House understand this is why they cannot get anything done. We are going

It states that it will be less expensive than the defense authorization bill last year and yet the only Federal programs that would be cut in this bill are the Defense Department accounts that do not get a 2-percent cut and the space agency accounts that receive less than 3 percent. The total number of cuts will be 30 percent. How can that be true? And then it says that because there are more Federal accounts that do not get cut than do these accounts, the savings are not enough to pay for the additional cuts required by the authorization bill for our Defense Department and for our space agency, but at the same time, the Department of Defense and NASA, these appropriations for these two accounts have not been cut.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to support Representative Bass' resolution to stand with the President and American families and encourage the use of the COPS Emergency Response Center in case of need. As you have already heard in the past, emergency response to small power failures is the first thing a business would do if they learned of an emergency and the equipment and personnel are there in the community to respond. There is simply no reason that they should not have the infrastructure to do so in the event of a major disaster and in a way that it is an up-front cost that they can actually afford to take advantage of that if they have to use the equipment and resources at a loss. So I think it is very important that this Congress continues to support the COPS program as the need for the emergency response is still much greater than

Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Culberson). The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Meeks] that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 1368, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds having voted in favor thereof) the rules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table. Talks with the Senate yield back to the House the remaining balance of their time.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I thank the gentleman for making that point, because you have made the precise point that this will make it more difficult for the European Union to meet its financial obligations if they do not have the ability to invest in their own economy. So if you look at the long-term implication of this as well as the short-term impact on the European economy that it would have on that agreement and that trade deal that has been reached in those trade agreements, I think it is important for us to be very clear about that that it has not been made in any way a promise that we could never do it. It has been made that there has not been going back on these agreements and that we cannot do that. We cannot take it back at this time because the intention is that the Europeans have assured us that they are going to not

His last two decades of service to the people of New York and to the United States were so remarkable and so full of promise that I cannot help but recognize him now as a kind and yet humble man in his retirement.

But for the reasons I have already raised, this subject of this bill is much more to the level of importance to them as a committee than it is to me and Senator Bond, and it is certainly more important to me than the time we could be here today. This is going to take a while, and we need to get it done now.  I yield the floor.

We must find a way to close these coal mines and clean up these abandoned mines so we can continue to be competitive in the global economy.  The U.S. Minerals Management Service has in recent years been dealing with both the acid mine drainage on the Columbia River and the massive underground coal mining waste being dumped in many areas of the country by polluting coal plants with lead and mercury to mine for the ultimate purpose of selling that lead and mercury for a profit.

But we have enjoyed working together as a product.

If you take the reports that are not correct, and that is a real problem that has to be looked at, to deny that information that is going to protect all people, even though it has some problem in it, that does not violate the protection that the chairman and the ranking member mentioned, I think it is appropriate for that to go into the bill and take place.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of Wisconsin's seniors and taxpayers to ensure that seniors receive the full benefits of the Medicare Program when they are in a position to retire and to ensure that individuals in nursing homes and the disabled receive the same benefits as the elderly in the general population. These entitlements in the health care bill are known as Medicare ``doc fix'' payments and a physician drug benefit. The legislation I am introducing today is designed to prevent any future Medicare doc fix payments from going to cover the services provided to the seniors in nursing homes and the disabled in the general population because this would likely increase the cost of the Medicare Program for seniors and the taxpayers, as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid combined would be significantly higher than the cost of these benefits alone.

In what can only be described as the most protracted military conflict in the history of the world, the Government of Cambodia has placed at risk the lives of scores of people. As of now, nearly 300 people have been killed.  I believe that this conflict was provoked by the tragic announcement of Cambodia's surrender to the Pol Pot regime by the United States and the Chinese and that its consequences could well be much worse. The fact is that Cambodia was invaded by the Pol Pot regime in 1988, as were the Thai and Vietnamese armies and many South Vietnamese people and monks who had fled to Thailand to escape the armed forces of Cambodia. Only an interim government was formed in 1991. The

Mr. President, I have just spoken with Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. He indicated he would be willing to reach out to Senator McCain for a time period to begin a certain dialogue. So I was prepared to give up on a particular number of amendments.  But let me speak for a few minutes about a number of those I understand are not germane or would require the agreement of the leader, either because they have not been cleared on the part of the minority or they would be in opposition to those who had been present and would be in opposition to the language which is included in this bill that may be in opposition to the minority.  Let me just say there are four of them, I believe, which are minor changes to language that were considered and spoken out of order. Those are the three dealing

Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 3863, the Student Debt Reduction Act.  I want to thank my colleagues from the Financial Services Committee, the Ways and Means Committee, and the Education and Labor Committee for their hard work on this measure. This legislation will provide interest payments to students who borrow money from banks to pay loans for their higher education expenses while saving the Federal Government $7 billion over the next 5 years.  I have a particular interest in providing relief to our community colleges that offer programs that support research and education and a community for educational advancement.  Last month, I attended a community college in my district that was providing affordable tuition, fees, and books to its members. Not only were they providing great programs to students, they also provided educational services for students and provided assistance to their staff. This college deserves our

And it provides for an accelerated technology transfer program so that we can ensure that our transportation is safe and that our manufacturers have the appropriate technology to produce those products that we are so interested in providing for our citizens. This bill also provides for the transfer of equipment and infrastructure needed to support our need for the exports of these types of goods and services to foreign countries which are also providing a high degree of income to our own citizens.

Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues are aware, I have been actively involved in the efforts to ensure a level playing field for students of our Nation's public schools. I think it is critical for all of us to remember the rich educational history that has helped to bring us to this point. For children born today in the late 1800's, over half of their education was spent in public schools. For students born today in the 1940's, over 60 percent of their education was spent in public schools. This is only the first generation. I have come to realize that this trend is completely unsustainable.  Mr. Speaker, the growing gap between the rich and the poor is a major concern and one I see every day in my district. In my district, poverty rates are nearly 10 percent higher than the national average and 14 percent higher

Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment to focus on the language that says that there is no provision in this bill to facilitate commercial space activities. That's something we should not be in the business of trying to do. The context in which this language was inserted today by the sponsor of the legislation said specifically that there was no preemption of the ability of private enterprise to engage in competitively-available space activities, which they do today.

I appreciate the question from my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky. To achieve water conservation and economic development, we will need to restore the experience of the Kennedy-Johnson Act of 1965. This law was the country's response to the well-intentioned government decisions of the 1950s that created an era of Federal overregulation in the public sector. While I know it has not been utilized effectively in nearly 30 years, the law has been a critical check against excessive Federal overreach and would be a useful safeguard should we pass this measure today. But I am concerned that a bill before us today would restrict the State and local governments from offering help to those who are in need and that the Office of the Law Revision Counsel would be required to reach into the Federal Government for information about the potential impact of this law on its clients.

I was part of the conference that put together the Medicare trustees report, and I'm very familiar with the authorizing bill that was given in the spring of 1997 that was essentially enacted in the spring of 1997 to increase the Medicare trust fund from the level that existed before the advent of the act to $250 billion by 2002.  I also come from a background of legislation that I did in the Congress on tax reform and I think it was a good piece of legislation that is very similar to the structure that we have here as we are doing the Medicare bill. I see the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee and the

Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in a colloquy, and also to make it clear that any legislation I introduce to authorize funding for the National Endowment for the Arts will include its funding for programs that are not the same as the President's proposed cuts in those areas.  While there are no specific cuts in specific programs that would affect this legislation, the Congress must recognize the important role that the NEA plays in America's cultural lives and in our Nation's development as a whole. It is not new for the Congress to consider cutting funding for the Endowment programs because of their impact on American cultural life in the public policy areas of funding the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution and funding our military and public health care systems and other similar programs. However, the existing appropriations for the NEA have been

And I would hope that this Congress would spend time and reflection on what they found. I think it is a very instructive document that is going to help us address some of the budget priorities that are before us in the next 4 years and will make it a lot easier to make the hard decisions when we look at this budget and start to make the hard decisions in the next Congress about our priorities. And we have something here that is going to give us a much better opportunity to make these decisions and at the same time get some numbers out there that will be very, very useful to the

Mr. President, I wanted to quickly review the historic 1st session of the 104th Congress, both in terms of the legislation passed and the way this Congress is taking up legislation, both of which will remain in effect for the long term. This Congress approved and passed very significant legislation dealing with the balanced budget amendment and tax reform that will go into effect next year and will help get Americans back to work and go to work putting our economy back on the right track. I think it was a good legislative session. It will allow us to take up a new bill on tax reform that we have introduced with Senator Smith that would provide a number of changes to the tax code to allow for significant cuts, simplification, and, I believe, greater certainty for American families.  There have been discussions over the last week about the necessity of additional tax cuts

If the gentleman will yield on that point, I would just note in my own State of Maine there are people who would support and who are enthusiastic about this idea of for the first time being able to have some of our public lands that are protected with their private property rights at the local level for public use and protection, for educational, for recreational purposes as opposed to being privatized and to be captured by management agencies or the Federal Government. I think this has tremendous potential for education in our local schools. It would not only enhance the quality of education for children in Maine, but it would be extremely important for our citizens because we have said many times that we should not have the Government take over our public lands for the sole purpose of using them for one specific use. It would provide real accountability to those local governments and the educational

This 1-inch inlet vent is an all-year drainage which supplies water to the North Platte and the Mississippi Rivers as they run their rivers and then runs into the Missouri River and the Upper Mississippi River as they travel across Iowa and Illinois. It is an important fact that Iowa produces 45 percent of the State's fresh water and Iowa also has the second-highest percentage of all wells used in Iowa during a typical summer's water supply, at nearly 80 percent.

Madam President, S. 1963, the Interstate Banking and Branching Act of 1994, is important legislation. It has the strong support of the industry and allows interstate transactions to be made on our main ports of entry, as well as on a very limited number of our commercial facilities. However, this law was not the result of real efforts on the part of this Congress and should be revisited.  The legislation does not create any new laws, and it is not likely to be implemented without meaningful congressional hearings and vigorous debate. This is because the need for interstate banking and branching will be very significant if this legislation is ever to take effect. While the technology of the large commercial banks and the large financial institutions that will play such a significant role in making the changes in the laws required by this bill are not widely known, they were readily apparent to many consumers

This is not how we should spend Federal dollars.  H.R. 1261 cuts job training for the 1.5 million workers who do not receive wage increases in exchange for receiving a wage cut. The same bill will also cut salaries of workers who receive jobs by over 50 percent, leaving them struggling to stay afloat in today's economy.

The President talked about the sacrifices that Americans make every single day on the basis that we need to have somebody on the other side of the aisle stand on their shoulders and say that we do want to pay down our debt, we do want to balance the budget, but we cannot do it alone.

Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program. This bill is not just a health care bill. It is also a tax bill, a spending bill, and a vote on tax relief for the people of this country. The provisions of the bill are controversial. They are hard to understand. They raise serious questions about whether the bill is good for our children and our children's health. For most people these issues are not that important, but for people who depend on the health of their children and the health of their families, the health of their children is of great concern. The American people want to know why a new tax provision would not be brought to the floor and what the implications would be for the bill before the Senate today.  I want to make sure I understand what this tax

Mr. Chairman, the decision to ban snowmobiles from the roads of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is not a new decision, but it is the result of many years of debate and studies by a wide range of groups and individuals who are concerned about the long-term impact on Yellowstone and Grand Teton and on the health of the surrounding communities. I understand and support that concern. I voted to reauthorize the National Park Service in fiscal year 2007 because I believe the agency should be reauthorized to protect the Park's future and also to ensure that funding for snowmobiles is on a level that will allow that agency to provide the necessary services that will continue to protect our environment and promote national parks and national recreation, and I would like to use the time on this amendment to talk about what the House Committee on Natural Resources would have

The amendment would also exempt an additional $700 million from the $1.2 trillion in mandatory spending levels in this bill and from the $1.4 trillion that the President has requested for direct and guaranteed funding for the deficit reduction programs for fiscal year 2003 and 2004 as well as the $2 billion set aside for deficit reduction in the fiscal year 2005 spending

Those arrangements include several exceptions to the existing law that enable Federal workers to obtain health insurance coverage or to apply for an employer plan on a State exchange, and some new work requirements that would permit Federal Government employees to join health plans, or to participate in certain Federal community service programs.

We have already heard that in one case a Presidential decree unilaterally declared the military taking power over Haiti because it has been declared a territory of Haiti. We have also heard that the Haitian military has now been giving over control of much of the country to the military dictatorship in Haiti.  Our concern about this is that the United States has spent more than $1 billion to support these rebels, to supply arms and to train them in Haiti.

Mr. President, under the Taxpayer's Relief Act of 1997, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of the United States was granted the ability to raise rates on members of its membership and their dependents in the State of New Jersey if Congress can't agree on a fair and even-handed increase in the Nation's minimum wage. My opposition to that legislation is based on this principle that if Congress can't find an acceptable way to raise the minimum wage to an even level, it should move forward with increasing it to what is in the best interest of the students who will be benefited by a higher minimum wage. It is a principle which I have tried to apply to the State of New Jersey as well as the Nation.  This July 14 general election in the State of New Jersey will allow Congress to take a step that will have a direct and measurable

First of all, to say that I am one that believes in fairness is not necessarily to be taken as a given here in the Senate today because I believe that there are many Americans in this country who do not believe that all human life should be set free. I do not believe that we should be limiting the ability of Federal workers to work for the Federal Government if that Federal employee has a preexisting condition that is a contributing factor to that condition. I believe that we should be expanding the Federal Government to do the same thing that State governments do for the children of their citizens. And to say that we do not want to have this particular bill before the Senate is not to say that we support the position of the Senator from Montana. I wish he could

Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, actually what the majority leader said was, when asked will we get to the bill and address the issue of military pay, he said no more congressional hearings on the issue of military pay as long as that was allowed.  I think that is unfortunate because the Senate clearly said that military pay is not a Federal issue under this bill. They agreed that it should be handled on a state and local level under State and local government authority, but they did not include the concept of military pay in that bill.  We need to deal with it. It is a $700 billion bill, $12 trillion in projected budget deficits. I think this is a reasonable compromise between the Republican and Democratic leaders to deal with it.

Mr. Speaker, one of the reasons that I am an Independent is that I feel that I am very fortunate that I come from a place where there are things that I feel very confident in and can be proud of. One of those is that people in this country can vote for their elected representatives and do the right thing by them as well as the good of the country that they represent and the world that they serve in. I am a firm believer in that and it is something that I think both Democrats and Republicans should be very proud of because the time is long gone in this country where this Congress would act against the wishes of its own people and be opposed by the voters and would decide to take not only away a right to vote but a right to hold that Congress accountable and to have the voters elect a Congress that they would want

But I think it is fair to say that every time we have seen a Congress pass legislation that affects one of our constituents, we have all been pretty very generous in our comments of being able to give them the opportunity to take advantage of it so they would be able to make a decision whether or not they wanted to go ahead with the change that they felt was appropriate in their community for the future.  Now that we have the passage of that piece of legislation, that has actually been held up because of some so-called do-nothing politics

The Members from New York and New Jersey are indeed right to be concerned that the Federal courts have a role in the judicial review of decisions made under the National Environmental Policy Act.

However, the President and his administration will not let the Senate go far enough for the American people to have a bill for their government to see and to implement.

It would be a very easy question for the administration to ask the Social Security trustees if the solution they come up with is acceptable to the majority of the trustees and the future generations of Americans that depend on Social Security to be there when that Social Security trust fund is raided because the budget resolution that was passed just before we left here did not authorize the Social Security trust fund for the next 75 years.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Solomon amendment. Mr. Chairman, in my analysis, this amendment would continue the Federal Government taking over ownership and using its efforts to interfere with States and local communities to resolve, for example, the civil rights issues of the 1960s and 1970s. Although I support the continued efforts of Congress to assure equality for all Americans and oppose attempts by the Federal Government to intrude into the business of States to resolve economic problems, I am troubled that Federal bureaucrats, not local residents, are the target of this amendment.  Currently, the Federal Government has jurisdiction over only 20 percent of the private economy. For example, under the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, the Federal Government intends to transfer 90 percent of the money used to conduct embryonic stem cell research to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 3997, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. While the economic outlook is not as dire as it once was or is currently, we must not abandon our economy and the taxpayers that pay for it. The stimulus was not an investment in this country's future but a disaster in the making.  We need a strong economy, a sound economy that creates jobs and a financial industry that serves America's banks and families. This recovery has been slow, but its benefits have been felt throughout this country and far beyond. This bill will throw away the investment in jobs and property during this dire economic time.  Many of my constituents, the residents of my district, are hurting financially. Sadly, this bill continues to pay out tax breaks to the very top of our society. The bill provides a large windfall to

Mr. President, I was there, and I saw how hard the Senator worked to pass the Small Business Jobs and Growth Act and the highway bill in 2002 and the Jobs for All Act in 2003. These were bills that had been passed in previous Congresses and were on the President's desk. But I see also in the budget we worked with the Republican majority to reduce the deficit. One of the things that has occurred over the years in this country is that as we have raised taxes, we have had fewer people receive benefits. Yet those in the private sector need more assistance to be able to take care of themselves and their families. The Small Business Jobs and Growth Act cuts tax loopholes by raising the payroll tax. That is the largest tax increase in the history of this country. That is on top of the taxes that are now on top

Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting to note that with the Michel bill, insurance companies would be able to sell their policies to almost every American and the Americans could pick the policy they liked. So with the Michel bill, they would have more choices than would insurance companies currently have in the United States.  For example, the President supports this bill, and he did not get on the bill as a Republican. But we have had six Democratic Senators on the bill, Democrat Senators who do support the President. So this bill will give the President and Republicans more choices than they have now, and it is good for the market as well as for the American people.  I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  clioburner said on May 10, 2007 at 5:43 pm,  decapitate said on

But I wish to tell you about another case that I think should be brought up during the course of the debate so we can start to get the Fed the money it needs to be here for our day-to-day needs and what we are trying to do with the budget.

It would require the Defense Department to conduct more studies on the threats and the conditions of combat conditions in certain forces in the time allotted for that study to be completed.  Our military forces are the most effective and versatile fighting force in our Nation's history. We must do everything possible to ensure that their success is not in jeopardy if the rules change under the law of war. We need to make sure that these increases in force requirements are not impacting these efforts to be the most effective fighting force of this Nation. I have introduced the Defense Amendments in the Armed Services Committee to put the Defense Department on a more realistic path by providing it with the time required to research these threat levels and to decide whether or not to do them.

The recent national report of the Economic Policy Institute on the economy on the impacts of the protectionist trade agenda on the economy is a clear and present danger to the middle class of this Nation and a direct attack on the ability of middle class families to get back on their feet and to start another small business that will be going to work today as they will see their jobs go to China and then to Mexico and beyond.

What we are talking about is a disaster. A death benefits policy would not be recognized for the flood insurance premium that you would have in an event of a flood. So what the chairman of the subcommittee is saying, under his amendment, is that that policy will not be recognized for those costs and will not be recognized for the fact that you would get the death benefit. Now the chairman of the subcommittee is talking about Federal purchasing power, which means that you are getting the benefit for the life of the policy even though you are dead for a long period of time.  And so now the chairman has a bill that will not recognize the policy

The proposal to increase taxes for working middle-class families would raise taxes on more than 14 million American families. This proposal would raise taxes on one-fifth of all American families, or 7.4 million families. For every family earning less than $30,000, the average tax increase would be $360.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, let me clear up a couple of issues. First, my colleague from Arizona just just said that we did not have the same majority in the last time we had a vote on this bill that we have today. That is false because we had a majority when we had the vote on the balanced budget amendment because we had the same number of Republicans as the Democrats last time we had the vote on the balanced budget amendment that we had on the tax cut bill. So the fact that there is a minority in the Senate today does not mean that the two parties do not work together and that the American people should not have a better product than the one that we have had before us. I would hope that we would not want to go back to the end of the session and say we have always been able to work with the minority.

The House bill needs to be the floor for what we accomplish out of this body in terms of deficit reduction. I want to go back to the balanced budget amendment. I also want to explain what I think is now a much more popular view among the most Republican Members of Congress that they want a balanced budget by a voluntary plan.  I do not have a plan. I have been in public service for 40 years. As a first-term Member of Congress, I do not have a plan, and so I will say this to the Republican leader. What we have today in terms of spending money is inadequate. It has declined steadily over the last 10 years. But I do not think anyone wants a plan to bring the Federal Government under control. It does not have to be a plan that cuts spending. It has got

Yes. So I think we need to consider history again, that has been referred to earlier by the distinguished Senator from California as this historic decision that this is a very complicated issue and that one who is not familiar with the past history needs to understand that we have not known this in the context of the war on terror to be the case. In the case of Iraq, it was the administration that did not know that that particular theater of operations was a terrorist activity, that we had no evidence that was known by them or by the enemy about that particular terrorist activity or about the killing of the Iraqis on the ground in the way that they had been given as part of the training for that particular terrorist activity. I am not suggesting that we do that, but it is kind of the question that is referred to in that of the war on

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, America's children could once again get the free education they deserve under the Goals 2000 Program. This bill is a dramatic and important first step in ensuring our children will have a quality education that will prepare them to go on to higher education, start businesses or enter the work force. America's schools need the help of this program. The bill before us increases the contribution of Federal funds for education from $24 million to $50 million for the 2004-2005 school year. This represents a 21 percent increase over the current Federal budget and will be a huge benefit to our public school systems across this country.  The State and local assistance fund will be $8 million a year over the next 5 years and will provide funds to States and localities to increase education levels and instruction in areas

If President Obama comes to Congress and demands that he come before Congress and resign after being hit with a public opinion survey that said half the people in America thought the President should resign after he took office that should be an indication that President Obama was in fact going to do the right thing when it came to breaking the bank by telling Congress what happened to his company's profits during the Deepwater Horizon disaster.

This would be the first extension of this credit since the credit was originally created in the 1990s and is still available today for a 2-year period.  This important extension will continue a long tradition of encouraging the production and commercialization of new and used hybrid and fuel-efficient vehicles. This is important to help the United States remain a leader in developing and implementing alternative energy and sustainability policies.

I think the administration's message was pretty clear to the American public when they said: No, we are not going to change that policy because it is not in the White House's budget.

In 1976, Judge Lewis and a fellow Wyoming judge each decided the case of Clark County v. County of Wyoming and Wyoming. The Montana State Court in that case held that domestic violence victims can sue the State to enforce section 8, the Wyoming Self-Determination Act, which forbids abortions prior to 20 weeks' gestation. After the case came to Federal Court, the case was settled out of court for $4,240. In return, the Government pays those victims up to $1,200 for each abortion at 20 weeks' gestation. That same $1,200 was then deposited into an Arizona fund to be used for victim protection and to pay any civil costs or legal

Over the last several months we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of women who have come to our health care system seeking abortion services and have sought them often in the midst of serious medical issues. They have asked to see a doctor, as one woman put it, but were turned away from the health care provider. They have not been told that the health care provider thought their health care was at risk and thus charged much more for the abortion services they wanted than they would have been for health care services that they would otherwise have gotten. Yet, the Senate remains in the debate over this legislation.  Over 100 hospitals across America have already announced that they will close their doors unless Congress changes its mind about
