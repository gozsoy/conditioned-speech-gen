Does the Senator feel the option of job vacancies that may be filled by H-1B visas was changed by this action of the majority leader in this time that was allowed so that those holders who were in that option would not have been able to have those jobs even if we had that option not in our country? I know the Senator knows very well that there is an option in the bill that allows those who are in that long-term temporary status. That is their option. Is the Senator aware that the change of that option in the rule changes that there are legitimate concerns about the change in that option for those holders who are not working in the full-time capacity for which they are looking? It does not allow them to be hired?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Timothy McDonald and Deb Schott, who both lost their lives last month during a helicopter crash on December 21.  Upon his return from his first deployment, James McDonald saw the headlines about his brother's death and perished in the helicopter accident. His impact on his family was tremendous.  Instead of simply being able to offer praise and best wishes to his brother, James' thoughts and prayers were focused on his ability to overcome adversity.  Yesterday, I joined millions of Americans across the nation to remember the life of James McDonald by having my office posthumously memorialized in a bronze bust of an American soldier.  Sadly, James McDonald will not be here to carry on his brother's legacy of service. His legacy is that of James and Michael McDonald. James' heroism won't go unnoticed.

Senator Grassley has long been an important and consistent voice for the defense of America's interests overseas. His service to the Senate began almost 20 years ago when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996 to become an amendment chairman and eventually a subcommittee chairman. After contracting his way through a field of political gaffes, Senator Grassley went on to serve as a U.S. attorney under George H.W. Bush, and then as a U.S. Senator in the current Democratic majority of the Senate.  Senator Grassley has fought every battle of the last four decades to promote America's security at home and abroad, and for more

The Senate confirmed my bill on November 17, 2007, and the House approved my measure on March 4, 2008.  Public lands, including public parks, wilderness areas, and national monuments, are in a state of irrevocable trust. For the past 5 years, Congress has been obligated to manage the lands and make certain resources available for use by the public. In fact, the Executive orders issued by President Bush requiring management of these lands and national monuments are subject to congressional review, unless Congress

I am proud of the sacrifices my fellow Ohioan Chris Henry and his wife Me enduring when they opened their first home. Now their business, Chris & Me Home For Sale in Wrightstown, has been enjoying a much-needed boost in order to continue to be competitive. In the fall, we hoped to have provided these low-cost credit to more homeowners, but the Government Accountability Office indicated that up to 35 percent of high-cost buyers and up to 36 percent of subprime buyers would be ineligible under the Clinton administration's loan program. That means that about 6,000 Ohioans may be denied

Shortly after the plane landed in Berlin and General Patton arrived on the scene with General John Alexander to report on the situation he was met with the following deputy commander from the American army, General Charles Wallace: ``If you will just read the paper, my son, you will see that General Wallace went in the back of the plane Everett arrived on.

I want to say to my friend from Missouri that I think he makes the case and he does so in a well thought-out way and he does so in a way that is State by State based on national disaster guidelines that all the States use in order to provide and assist that one State in this instance where death, human loss has occurred in an attempt to do what all the States do to provide for the public welfare and law and order and safety.  Mr. Speaker, I think that the initial sponsor and author of this bill, the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] and others who have worked with him, have crafted a legislation that all of the States can support. I believe that in this case all of the States will

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will begin consideration of our final--our final--appropriations bill for this session. The bill before us will fund Government, but also ensure the safety of American families and the security of the Nation. It is a bill which I have voted for many times in the past, a bill that I think we should pass with as few changes as possible to the Murray-Daines amendment. I believe all Members who support the Murray-Daines amendment will make this important and effective amendment to the bill.  We must assure that the Government can respond to real emergencies--in this case, the North Korean nuclear threat, and this bill will give the President the authority to respond in a real emergency in an emergency. In addition, we have made good on our commitment to strengthen international efforts to address the global threats posed by

Mr. Chairman, it takes $5 million from the DOT's Financial Management Capital account and puts it in the budget of the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. We have increased that money to $10 million.  If that is the way we go with this now, I am very concerned that the FAA will have to use this additional funding to make other other parts of the system operate more efficiently or maybe make sure that Congress does not get wiped out in budget reconciliation if we do not do something.  Now, the agency is very fortunate. When they retire, they do not need this money. But I want to make sure the agency has some flexibility so they can take this money and use it as they see fit.  This committee is not going to approve what the Federal Aviation Administration is doing with this $5 million. Now,

The select few, like Staff Sergeant Allan Jay Kellogg from my State of Hawaii, who serve in harm's way in Iraq do not get to choose a life of service that is just a choice to make in the end but one that allows them to select a career that is more meaningful and lasting. They cannot even make that choice at this point in the process, when the public and the Congress knows how the risk is far too great.  We know that if we sent the men and women of our military to war based on intelligence that said they were going to be Allan K. Kellogg or Sergeant Kelly Larson or Richard Regula, they would probably end up in a terrible wound, even though those civilians would never know they were in harm's way.

One last myth goes like this. This procedure could possibly be the best procedure in the world.

This procedure does not do anything in this legislation to limit abortion in any way. So, abortion advocates are trotting out these abortion myths.

Madam Chairman, this is a thoughtless and destructive amendment. I strongly oppose the underlying bill. The amendment attempts to add insult to injury by penalizing responsible energy development projects based on the current Federal funding allocations to pipeline projects. This undermines millions of dollars in financial assistance dollars and adversely impacts projects that seek Federal assistance dollars to increase energy efficiency and cost savings through Federal investment dollars in energy efficiency projects through profoundly cost-prohibitive Federal projects. In this way it would potentially prevent projects that reduce costs from funding the billion dollar energy efficiency improvements of which we are all proud.  We should not be imposing significant Federal mandates on projects that seek Federal support only to see them denied Federal funds due to lack of funding or where the Federal Government is barred from providing assistance due to a lack of funding. Unfortunately, this amendment simply does not provide Federal financial

Since February of 2005 Lithuania has worked cooperatively with the United States to help rebuild Lithuania's economy.  Lithuania's President Atila Latsis immediately recognized that the newly independent nation could not remain dependent on the Russian Federation for its economic growth.

All of us are very much concerned about excessive spending by the Federal Government. We are concerned that many of the proposed new programs could increase Federal spending in the long term by as much as $12 trillion over the next 10 years. But this government is spending far too much and is a bigger Federal Government than the private sector would accept on its own terms as it currently does. In order to address that problem and keep regulations low and rules enforced by a shrinking private sector, we would do better to curb government spending more effectively by limiting Federal Government regulatory authority to what it already lawsuits.  By limiting our ability to restrain Federal regulation, we can create the conditions that can more effectively foster our entrepreneurial spirit, which is a key factor that is commonly cited as a key factor in our economic future.

They can't afford it. They are taking their kids to school. They have to cut back on their 401(k)s. They are worried about their health care. They are worried about how they are going to pay their mortgage. They are worried about a whole lot of these issues.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise to wish a happy birthday to a House Member who was appointed to Congress by Ronald Reagan in 1987 and has served in the Congress since then. Ronald Reagan was the supreme President of the United States at that time, and he used his influence to restore our country to the good times that it had been in just over 30 years before that. He used the power of that Presidency to bring about these reforms to consume public money.  I believe that we are heading in the right direction, and I would like to encourage all Members of the House to celebrate the birthday of former U.S. Congressman Lawrence Everett Miller of Oregon.

No. In fact, the plan I have endorsed would expand expensing for small business. I say that because I think that the same things that are important that are important to businesses that have employees are also important for small business that do not have employees that have been in fact completely set aside for whatever reason. I think they would be happy with that as well. So I would hope that this plan would make it possible for small business to be more stimulus of the economy and not become quite as wedded to the Government as their Fortune 500 counterparts and not lose sight of what is important for small businesses.

What we are talking about is the technology that is being developed in this country, the energy that is being developed here, that we as a Nation have so of an interest in investing in.

Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute and to honor a young man who has given so much to our country and to our community. Let us honor Army Specialist Tyler Ellin of Healesville, CA. He has been killed in Iraq today while serving his country and his family with honor and distinction. This past weekend I had the opportunity to pay tribute to Specialist Ellin at the ceremony to honor his distinguished service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. His battalion commander was in the helicopter gunnery and grenade room as he spoke with troops on patrol. The helicopter was shot down by Iraqi suicide bombers. When he opened fire, his body was still on the floor.  I spent time with Specialist Ellin and with his mother as well as with family, friends, and fellow soldiers at the ceremony to honor him and his extraordinary story.

When it came to the substitute amendments, they voted not in unison, not in broad language but only in native native Hawaiian language, and I thought that was wrong, that it was a betrayal of the House, that it was not recognizing their feelings about their community, that they should just vote their will to make those laws their community, not the only people in Hawaii that have rights

We want to make sure that the reforms passed in this rule will make a real difference in the way we purchase goods and services that help Americans purchase their homes, buy their equipment for their business and purchase the products that will sell to sale. The only way we will succeed, and that is if we stand together, is if we will work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that we get this bill out here in a form that will be acceptable to both parties and also be a change from where we have been.

It is right that Israel should be strong and secure in its choices, especially those regarding Iran and Hezbollah. However, Palestinians must also be protected and Israel must continue to adhere to the terms of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. Israel must protect Lebanese citizens as well as protect its citizens in Lebanon from any incursion or attacks from Iran.  Today Israel is very much in the middle of one of the most horrific crises in recent decades. From a massive natural disaster, Lebanon has lost an estimated 1.5 million people, 1 million of whom have been killed and another 3 million wounded. This crisis began at 7 a.m. on Wednesday when a jet fighter made an ill-advised strike on a refugee camp in western Lebanon.

Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Durbin to protect jobs for American families. The Bush tax cuts, which largely benefited the wealthy, are doing severe damage to jobs in this country. Unemployment benefits are declining as employers begin to pull back jobs in recession. These reductions are leaving unemployment rates rising. These are job cuts.  The Senator from Illinois has been the leader on the issue of securing the jobs of these people in the very working families that I have heard so much talk about. One of his top priorities is to help unemployed and jobless workers get a raise. Under his amendment, $10 billion in tax relief will go to unemployed Americans who can afford to be on their own in a time of economic crisis. He has a few other ideas. I support his amendment as well. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to support S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 provides FDA the necessary authorities to carry out the Food and Drug Administration's vital mission of protecting human health and the environment. The bill also provides the agency additional resources for national information technology to enable faster, more reliable, and affordable FDA processes.  It is clear that the FDA is vital to FDA's efforts to provide access to medicines and devices to patients in emergency situations. I commend Senators Rockefeller and Wellstone for including this emergency emergency supplemental provision in this measure providing invaluable assistance. Supplemental appropriations provide vital supplemental treatments to pediatric surgical surgeries requiring surgical techniques requiring surgical anesthesia treatments requiring surgical anesthesia treatments requiring surgical surgical surgical treatments requiring surgical surgical surgical treatments requiring surgical surgical surgical treatments requiring surgical surgical surgical life-saving

Mr. President, I listened to the speeches of the majority leader and the Republican leader. They said they are all for small business and they are all for small business in this country and it is all about the same thing when we listen to them that we have come so far in the Republican budget that they have come so far in the Democratic budget and the Government of the United States has to go back to the days when it worked for all of the years we have had a Republican President and that is the way it is supposed to work.  I went through the history of Government we are talking about today and I would suggest that they did not have much choice about their budget plan because they could not take this Government off their shoulders, they could not have put the Government back into business, they could not have had the opportunity to have the

Mr. President, an old Chinese proverb says: ``If you do not pay the doctor who will do the care, he will never cure you.'' Today that means that medical care will continue to be paid by patients in health reform, or it will go to the State of Nevada.  State control of our health care system means that patients will have a lower standard of living. When families with children and other special needs have more trouble getting health care, the government will pay more to guarantee their care.  Under my proposal, we will pay for health care, not the government, to provide health care to more Nevadans. The Governor of Nevada, the gentleman from Nevada [Mr. Kolbe], will set the funding level.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.

This is the sense of the House of Representatives that we have failed to uphold principles of humanity by upholding international norms.  The current diplomatic approach to the U.N. was used in 1993, when we tried to justify failing to provide a ``national health declaration'' on smoking, yet failed to give the U.N. a role in drafting an international health policy.  As a result, we are not only failing to uphold the basic ideals of equality and friendship, but we are failing to serve our fellow human beings by supporting human rights violations.

The Asian carp has been found to live in our waters for more than 60 years, but Congress must keep our eyes peeled for additional new threats as the seasons change and aquatic organisms grow stronger.  In June, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection completed their annual Cleanwater Study. This investigation found that Pennsylvania waters contain between 50 and 100 invasive Asian carp species, including American carp. We need to consider these new threats, especially in light of the new advisory by the Federal Government to state the dangers posed by aquatic invasive species.

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, the bottom line here and the reason that I believe the chairman of the committee should accept my offer is that the problem has to do with the procedure in the House. Under the H.R. 3564 bill, the bill provides that Members would have to take this kind of action in the House only once in their terms of office for which they are being sought for re affordable housing. I think the chairman should accept this offer and extend that rule to their term in the House in order to deal with this problem.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is past time for America to have a climate deal with America and to stand up for the future of this country and the world in this very important climate vote north of the border.  Again, Speaker Pelosi deserves our praise and gratitude for offering this resolution, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.  Now on to the other side of the aisle and the other stranded workers.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor, with my friend and colleague Senator Sarbanes, an amendment to extend the minimum wage to individuals and small businesses that would provide for an additional increase for individuals and small businesses for working poor in this country by providing that if the Government has overpaid people or if the Government overpaid people at the end of the year the Federal Government would not have to pay back any overpayments that have occurred that year or the next year that the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and the Committee on Finance have each approved concurrent legislation to extend the minimum wage.  The question that we have for the Senate is this: If we put this amendment in place today, will there be an increase for the work force of individuals and small businesses?  We are going to be working on this issue until there is a change

Mr. President, over the past few years funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities has been reduced each year for a variety of reasons. But for families and nonprofits in the arts community this funding shortfall has also given rise to a growing perception that funding for arts education is now funded less than funding for grants for social programs like the earned income tax credit. I will not debate this issue in the time available on the floor of the Senate today, but it is important to highlight this festival is having an impact on both the private and public sectors. One-third of the festival's estimated $12 million in ticket sales is for families, 38 percent of which are under 25 years old. On a per person basis, the festival attracts approximately 200,000 adults and families.  The summer 2018

Mr. Chairman, you know, as you've heard, this issue is really about this: it's about the institution of congressional oversight. When there are thousands of Federal laws enacted that Congress has never even voted upon or authorized, that Congress then asks Congress to amend them when they meet some reality on a day-to-day basis, but this bill gives Congress the ultimate power to unilaterally alter those laws and make them heroes for their overreaching and their inefficiency because they simply can't work the same way you do on your day-to-day life in your job. You can rest assured that somebody else, somebody more experienced, somewhere else, somewhere, will come to your assistance.  This is a very, very, bad idea and a policy that does nothing but seriously handicap the oversight of this agency. I rise in opposition to this amendment

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from AFSCME which states this bill does not and will not help the American people. It is clear that Bill Clinton and the Democrats are increasing government spending and increasing taxes, and in the process they will do more to hurt the economy and increase taxes on the American people.  Speaker Gingrich and the Democrats did not just pass this bill because they do not like it, they passed it because they wanted to vote for it on a partisan basis because it will boost the economy. The Democrat Party is continuing to strangle the President by repeatedly shutting down the government because he refuses to sign or negotiate an extension of unemployment benefits.

The programs authorized under the Workforce Investment Act are designed to provide workforce training to people who are out of work and would be otherwise in need of training and other support services in order to move them into the work force and into other States' economies. We must provide programs that support these services, programs that are as effective as those in States which are doing better.  However, I am deeply concerned by the bill's dismantling of labor protections contained in the Family and Medical Leave Act and the States' opt-out provisions, thereby ending programs for at-risk workers and allowing these employers to once again turn away qualified workers.

I want to take this opportunity to join with my colleague and our ranking member in the House in standing up for the American people and standing up for a new direction for our post-Watergate America.  Congress and the American people have known since 9/11 that if we don't do something in this country to address the national security of the United States and then to address the national security of the Columbia River basin, we will leave a country vulnerable to a terrorist attack. Congress has rightly tried to respond to this threat, as I know the ranking member from the District (Ms. Norton) and I have tried to respond to this threat, and it is very clear to me that if we don't address this

The first thing that was said was, ``It would break the spirit of this place to even bring that up when there are just so many other things that we could have started with broke.''  The first speaker of this House talked about education reform and all of the other things, as if this is not broken. No, it is not broken, and it ought not to be broken.

Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2004, which would support needed health coverage for more than 13 million children and their families nationwide.  This legislation would reauthorize the children's health insurance program for a total of 10 years in order to give the committee full time to complete the reauthorization of this important health insurance program. This legislation will also permit States to change State coverage standards if they choose to do so as opposed to voting to permanently impose coverage standards on all children in a State.  My State of Washington will continue to require health insurance coverage for its children for the next 10 years. At the same time, this legislation extends the deadline for doing so for some other States as well.  In order to complete the re

Mr. Chairman, the decision to ban snowmobiles from the roads of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is a well-intentioned effort to try to promote a more healthy Yellowstone and Grand Teton experience for our visitors. The only problem is that the decision to ban snowmobiles also ignores the fact that people visit the parks far more often than the chairman of the committee and the staff could ever imagine. My view on that matter is that when the House is considering bills that we have passed that have no effect on the Clinton administration's national park programs, then the chairman of the committee should look for a better option for the American people. The decision to ban snowmobiles from the roads of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is a very unfortunate precedent, and we ought not pass it on to our children and grandchildren.  <|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the welfare bill recently passed by the Senate provides that families may be eligible for assistance if their income is less than 138 percent of the Federal poverty level for the family of four for the year in which the bill is enacted. However, States will not be able to use this exemption for children in families with more than two children unless they also provide for them in their amendment to the House version of the bill before the Senate today. For example, children who are 5 years of age and less than age 13 could not use this benefit if their parents work skills intensively and attend school full time. The Senate amendment would require States to follow a minimum grade-level qualification which would exempt them from providing assistance for students with special needs and help for children who fail to qualify for public assistance.

It is a special deal for the Pentagon to decide whether or not there are defense contractors in this country. It is a special deal for the Department of Defense to decide whether or not they will build certain kinds of landmines. And it is not only that the taxpayer should suffer some sort of loss in that one instance that they are buying supplies or they consume items from this manufacturing site that these kinds of products will come into the United States of America. They can also use landmine parts, and that can increase that cost.  These are not jobs that are coming from the Defense Department, these are jobs that are coming from the private sector.

I would be pleased to do so. In choosing the term ``compelling,'' we relied on the rule of law which allows the Senate and House to consider legislation as well as proposals for a law to be supported on a term-limits basis under some circumstances which are not heretically defined as a legislative requirement of law. If the person who wanted to support that proposal for any reason had done so on a legal basis that would not be a defendant but rather that would be a Senator-designate, then it would be a different matter to be prosecuted under those circumstances than would be a case that involved DNA evidence.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Solomon amendment. Mr. Chairman, in my analysis, this amendment is nothing but another attack on this Nation's effort to bring our fiscal house in order. It would effectively prohibit States from adopting new Federal savings measures designed to increase fiscal discipline and keep Government revenues down. For example, it would prohibit States that consider new spending measures that impose spending cuts to consider proposals to eliminate existing Federal spending measures that would allow them to oppose tax increases.  As the past two Congresses have demonstrated, the Solomon amendment would force States to consider spending cuts in the absence of any available budgetary savings. By requiring State legislatures to consider proposed spending reductions, the Solomon amendment would, for the first time, make possible a proposal that puts a ``grunt labor'' on fiscal discipline in the States.

Madam President, the word ``bipartisanship'' gets tossed around a lot in this town. Unfortunately, we have seen bipartisan efforts fail at every turn. Senator John McCain of Arizona put it well in a recent speech when he said that in the bill that passed this Congress the agreement was made to help seniors over health care costs. Senator McCain is right about that because there were no such agreements because the problem with health care insurance is that health care insurance companies have been paying health care costs for healthcare. That is not only inefficient but it is unfair to seniors because a shortage of health care is not being met in the senior community.  One of the last cases of bipartisanship was during the last Congress, when the Republicans passed a bill that I supported that would have made it possible for seniors to be included as members of Medicaid.

What we are doing is we have got Federal employees here that have spent their whole working life doing something I really like to call the dirty work of the Federal Government doing something we think is very important that we do something about it this time when we need it the most moment after moment after moment.  This is not a purely personal issue for the people of Colorado. I want to congratulate the people of Colorado. We have got good employees here. It is important that we make good use of them.

Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It would simply ask us to learn more. It would put a requirement in our budget that we actually find out how much money is going to go to the executive branch to support climate change. It would provide us with a framework for oversight and accountability and debate that will produce a legislative response that is driven by science rather than vice versa. It would provide Chairman Pallone with a research forum to provide direct feedback to the Congress on how much funds are going to be provided to specific Federal agencies or programs that may be taking an unfair or inadequate amount of coverage.  For far too long the Federal Government has responded to climate change with an ephemeral response: ``Well, what are you going to do about it?'' They always say, ``Well, we will not have any oversight because we are

Mr. Speaker, Trade Adjustment Assistance was designed as a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of American families who lost their jobs as a direct result of international trade and some of the most outrageous tax breaks that the Federal Government has granted to special interests in recent years. These assistance funds not only take people out of poverty but enable them to start again and it is one of the most effective forms of economic development that we can pass on to the next generation of families and it is an example of what the line item veto and the line item veto can do.

I would like to announce that tax proposals of this type are not good for America. Tax increases are not the way to pay for Government programs that support programs such as Medicare and Social Security and so on. Instead we should be working to reduce class warfare, to set lower interest rates for middle class families, and to eliminate the deficit so we can end our dependence on foreign oil. We should reduce our role in the war on drugs by improving treatment and rehabilitation and alternative and natural cures for addiction and disease. We should not be creating a new bureaucracy in Washington that would lead to costlier and less effective Government services. We should begin to reduce the number of Federal tax

This bill would benefit our Armed Forces, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and National Guard personnel, as well as the Coast Guard and other naval and Marine Corps units.

There is another area that I have some very serious concerns about, very serious concerns, and that is not just in the State of Washington where it seems to be very destructive to the economic well being of the country but I have the same concerns about this new cut that is in this plan that the time has come for us to be up front with the American people about what they are going to be taken out of the years and months that they have already spent in the days and weeks that they have already spent working with us in an effort to establish some kind of government plan that would restore the political process to conflict and the government would regain its constitutional role in promoting both economic growth and democratic governance.

That individual, Professor Schneider of the University of Pennsylvania, proposed regulations that would require guidelines to be set forth for the evaluation of certain facilities for nuclear testing and for the evaluation of other facilities for nuclear testing; which, as I indicated earlier, is considered a medical facility.
