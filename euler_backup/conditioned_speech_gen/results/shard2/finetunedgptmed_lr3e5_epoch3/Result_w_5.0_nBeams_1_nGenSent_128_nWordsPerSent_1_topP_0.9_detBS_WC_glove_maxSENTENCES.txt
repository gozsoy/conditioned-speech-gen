Madam Chair, I rise in support of the amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 that would prohibit the use of funds to implement the so-called ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy that was implemented in the military in the last year of the Obama administration.  This policy was a direct attack on the rights of our military and the rights of our military families to be able to serve their country without fear of being discharged or being denied access to the military because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is a policy that is not only wrong but it is a policy that is not only unconstitutional but it is a policy
