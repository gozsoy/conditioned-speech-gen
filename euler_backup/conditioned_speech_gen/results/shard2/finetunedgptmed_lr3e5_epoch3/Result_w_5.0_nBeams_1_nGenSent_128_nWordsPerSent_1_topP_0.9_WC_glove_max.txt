We cannot continue to pour money into Iraq, and then we will not be there to train the people of Iraq.  Let us vote no.

Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives approved a second bailout for financial institutions by the Federal Reserve. The Senate only needed to pass the first bailout before it passed by a bipartisan margin. In total the three bills have now passed both Chambers with overwhelming bipartisan support. As the House and the Senate both turn to other issues it is important that they not lose sight of the fact that the primary responsibility that we have for fiscal responsibility lies with our Federal Government and not on some group of politicians who take advantage of the Federal taxpayer and use the taxpayers' money to do the bidding of some of the biggest and most powerful financiers and trading firms in the country

At a time when Americans need relief from crippling budget deficits, from red ink that does nothing to help Americans and

Mr. Chairman, I certainly agree that the importance of this important issue cannot be underestimated. There is strong support for the concept in my district and throughout the United States, and the inclusion of funding for the child labor program is imperative to achieve the goal of ending child labor in the garment industry.  While I support the goal of providing funds to address the problem of child labor in the garment industry, I oppose adding a much-needed child labor program at the expense of other other vital labor programs which are important in our industrial base and our national security.

In States that have implemented cost containment measures to reduce the number of individuals on their Medicaid rolls or provide adequate insurance alternatives, coverage of long-term care services is generally provided by State health plans. Long-term care coverage is often included in the employee health benefit package to help employers provide employees with adequate health care coverage and may be provided for long-term care services beyond the term of the health plan. In addition to providing employee health benefits, the employee health benefit plan also may provide care as an individual self-pay Medicare benefits program.  According

We know that not only are those bills being paid by banks that have financial ties with Halliburton and other contractors there, but they are being paid by those same people. The economy has been suffering. We all know that was wrong to begin with, and that is why Republicans are pushing through legislation that they have introduced that would help the middle class Americans and the small businesses to keep more of their money in the process of payment of their bills and to make sure that their finances are

Mr. President, I rise to address some of the misrepresentations from my Republican colleagues that Senator Inhofe's amendment would put $12 billion in additional funds for the Small Business Administration to help small businesses who are facing the most severe economic downturn in 20 years. That is simply not the case.  There are five main reasons why this amendment cannot be good for small businesses and would actually put more money in the economy than would be necessary to help the largest amount of those seeking help to keep their businesses going or purchase more equipment to help get them out of this difficult economy.  First, for small businesses to grow, they need jobs. We all

Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be Chief Justice of the United States. The Senate has not been in session for most of this week, so I will make three quick points in the next few minutes. First, I hope all Members will pay attention to what I have to say. Second, I wish we were debating a Republican and Democratic nomination. This nomination is not an appointment by the President or a nomination by the Democratic Senate for the President. It is a nomination made by the Democratic Senate, under the leadership of Chairman Schumer and Ranking Member Leahy of the Judiciary Committee and supported by Republicans

Mr. President, when the 9/11 Commission took a critical look at the Government's policy of support and mission in Iraq, the recommendation it made was that the United States could not fight two wars simultaneously. Despite the grave risks involved in pursuing two separate wars, in its most recent report on Iraq, the Government Accountability Office noted that ``unlike other conflicts of major strategic importance, the focus on combat and troop engagement has not been based on the strategic force of the enemy and the purpose for which the war is being conducted.'' Our commanders and generals simply have not told us the true scale of the mission for which the war is being conducted or the means

Madam President, for months the President has said we need to come up with a budget that raises the debt limit in order to avoid having to increase the national debt by that much of any amount that we will spend in the year 2020.  The bill before the Senate, the so-called ``so-called Coburn-Snowe proposal'' was not crafted to cut spending and raise the debt limit in that manner and has not even come close to that in any way. It has the potential of doing both. This bill is designed to shift the balance of our national debt on to our children and grandchildren and does so by holding the national debt and

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Special Committee on Aging be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on July 26, 2011, at 10 a.m., in room 430 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.  The  drastically diminished life expectancy of the baby boom generation and its effect on the elderly has been the subject of great national and international attention. We are all aware of the many outstanding contributions made by people who have provided more than a century of dedicated service to the people of their country and the nation as a whole. I am honored to recognize and thank Senator Enzi for his work in the area of chronic illness

It is not much money but enough money to fund everything that is on the books at this time. So we can all go home and say that we have been to a real surplus. We have been to a surplus

Mr. President, on this day in history, the world will no doubt honor a leader of world recognition and skill in the executive branch, President Gerald R. Ford, who died yesterday in Baltimore at the age of 93.  President Ford never sought to serve his country by a second term, nor did he run for a second term only because he would not get the call of the nation. In many ways the history of this Nation is a legacy of Presidents who put the interests of the Nation before their own political ambitions and State and personal desires. Indeed, the energy with which the men and women of this Presidency sought to be elected and hold office came

This legislation puts a halt to reckless tax subsidies that have allowed hundreds of hundreds of thousands of Americans to find themselves out of work, trying to help their families get by with their mortgages and with their credit cards because they owe so little on those debts. This bill also makes sure that when we buy flood insurance

Mr. President, this year marks the 75th anniversary of the opening of the West Side Post Office in East Brunswick, ME. On January 12, 1881, a young Amos Haight named Milt and his fellow members of the Rochester Portage & South Brunswick Railroad made the decision to develop and operate a State post office in their own community and opened the doors of East Brunswick in 1881. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the East Brunswick Post Office proved to be one of the premier building options in the city of East Brunswick to serve the local business community and growing urban population.

Mr. Chairman, this amendment to H.R. 6 would reduce funding for new orders from $2 million to $750,000, which is a 7-percent cut from the $3 million that is already provided in this bill. I oppose the amendment on two grounds: first, we do not need $2 million to spend more time on the issue of enforcing in-migration and terrorist visa fraud than we do on border security; second, the $750,000 figure is not included in this bill and does not go for any new order of the administration or any new resources in implementing new quotas for in-migration and terror visa fraud

Madam Speaker, today I am proud to bring to the House the much-needed extension of the federal sugar program. This 6-month extension is necessary to allow the government to continue to administer the program and to continue to meet its obligations under the Federal sugar program that has been so successful in the United States. However, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) has requested that the sugar program delay its beginning of the summer farm season, and this delay would be much more damaging to local farmers and the economy in the summer months.  It would also further affect the farmers and grocers throughout the country, and this is not a good idea when

Mr. Speaker, in 1843, President Abraham Lincoln appointed three Commissioners to organize the American public schools system: Alexander Marshall, Charles E. Logan, and John B. Ewing of the State of Indiana. In April of that year, they put the first few hundred students to work building and expanding an entire system of 12 public schools in a small community in my district.  The result of the efforts of the Commissioners and the local school boards was the successful establishment of what was to become the public school system in our country. Today, the State of Kansas has one of the highest number of public schools in the Nation. The system consists of about 300

Mr. President, I will vote against the confirmation of John S. McCain to be the next Secretary of Defense. Although I strongly support his outstanding nomination as a lawyer, I have serious reservations about his legal and policy views and his role in the war in Iraq. Many Members of this body have come to the same conclusion. We have read his legal arguments and others for many years and we have become a nation more closely linked to Iraq and its government and people than ever before. Unfortunately, we have learned a great deal about the war since the President chose him for the job but we have not learned enough about America's continuing involvement in that war.

As many of my colleagues know, this is absolutely true in every community in America today. Yet the American people are going to have to put up with the idea that if they are not found to have a job

Then in 1980 we had a Republican President and I was in the Clinton administration and they made the same decision that we made. In the health care bill that was passed in 1993 we made the same decision that the Democrats made in 1993, in terms of high deductibles. We made that choice to make
