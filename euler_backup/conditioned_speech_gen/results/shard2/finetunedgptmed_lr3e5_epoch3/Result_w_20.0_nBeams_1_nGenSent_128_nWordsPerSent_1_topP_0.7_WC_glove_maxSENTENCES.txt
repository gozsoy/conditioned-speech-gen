Mr. President Defense primary care programs support more than 60 million people, and more than half of those are Medicare beneficiaries. Medicaid and Medicare provide essential health care to about 13 million people.  The legislation we are considering today creates a new entitlement program that encourages Medicare recipients to enroll in TRICARE, requiring TRICARE to notify enrollees if they enroll in a program that doesn't meet eligibility requirements.  The legislation mandates that enrollees enroll in TRICARE for up to 6 years. It requires enrollees to be responsible for the full cost of their prescription drugs, and it requires enrollees to maintain an annual wellness evaluation and wellness checkup.

This amendment would bring Congolese rebels to parity with the Rwandan and Burundian rebels, and would do so at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer.  As we debate the international aid bill, we have to keep in mind that the United States has a responsibility to support the most vulnerable people in the world. We have a responsibility to stand with those who have lost everything, and that is what we are doing in

Mr. President last week victory in the sewerage bill was not an isolated event. The bill has become the foundation of a good many of the policies the majority party has put forth in the last year.  The basic thrust of the bill is that a State can set up a pilot program for sewage treatment without the fear of being sued. It is a model which could be used to deal with any other serious problems that States might have.  Mr. President, if this program were to become law, what would the result be? I have a hard time imagining a more serious problem than to have a State unable to pay its bills for the treatment of

We should take steps to reduce the Federal debt, reduce the Federal deficit, and reduce the debt, and not raise taxes.  That is why the tax reform package that we have in front of us today is an opportunity to put our fiscal house in order. It is an opportunity to stop the IRS from taking money from American families and businesses, to reduce the deficit, and to reform our Tax Code. It is an opportunity to save Medicare from bankruptcy and save Social Security from bankruptcy.  Mr. President,

This legislation would create a new Federal program to promote safe and effective alcoholic beverage and food safety laws, and it would provide additional Federal funding to assist States in enacting such laws.  The bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to coordinate the implementation of State laws to prevent underage drinking and other illicit drug use. It would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish one or more programs to assist States in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing alcoholic beverage and food safety laws.

He served the citizens of the United States in a bipartisan manner, and I am sure he will be missed.  Wesley was born in 1941 in Greenville, SC. After attending Greenville High School, he attended the University of South Carolina and the University of Georgia, where he graduated with a degree in history and journalism.

Mr. President Congress needs health care doctors, not bureaucrats. The last time Congress created a commission to study health care reform, the administration asked for over $3 billion in Federal funds. When the Congress sent over its health care reform bill to the President for his signature, the administration demanded only $300 million.  The administration is again asking for $3 billion. How can they ask Congress for $300 million? It is obvious that the health care reform bill we have is a Trojan horse for the creation of a bureaucracy to determine what Americans can and cannot receive.  The President and his supporters have said the new health care law will lead to more competition

Mr. Speaker, Iraqi wing USS Starkweather was destroyed on April 23, 2006, when it collided with the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, carrying 10 members of the crew.  On that day, as we all know, we witnessed the destruction of a cherished family, a cherished naval unit, a cherished symbol of the United States, a symbol of freedom and liberty.  Today, we pay tribute to those sailors, the crew, and the families who have lost loved ones on that fateful day. It is with a deep sense of sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to those families, to pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the sailors

The concept was first introduced in the late 1960's as part of the Reagan welfare reform law. In 1986, Congress passed a waiver to the Welfare Reform Act that allowed States to opt out of welfare reform and, in turn, to accept workfare as a Federal entitlement.  In 1993, Congress passed the Workfare Act, which established a series of welfare reforms that, among other things

However, the fact of the matter is that the tax cut package, which would provide an average of $1,000 per family for families earning $75,000 a year, would be vetoed by the President, would not become law, and the tax cuts that he is pushing on the American people would be vetoed by the President.

Mr. President Canada seniors Canadian seniors, including the farmers and the farm workers of the Peace River Valley, are experiencing a severe winter in which our Nation's crop insurance programs have been severely underfunded. This is because the fiscal year 1994 farm bill, as it is currently written, will not provide sufficient funding to cover the premium costs of crop insurance for those who rely on crop insurance to protect their retirement.  For those of us in the Senate who are farmers, we have had to come up with ways to increase crop insurance premiums, or at least to keep up with the premium costs of crop insurance.

Unfortunately, the average American does not earn enough to earn that level of income. According to the Tax Foundation, the median family income is $51,200, and in some cases, the median income of an individual is $54,200. Even worse, our tax system penalizes working Americans who make less than $44,000 a year.

The Committee on the Judiciary, in working with the Attorney General, has taken important steps to address the growing problem of criminals' sentencing. In a recent report, the Committee highlighted the serious threat that sentencing of violent offenders is to our society and our States.  The problem is the overuse of mandatory minimum sentences. Since 1980, the amount of time served for violent crimes has increased by 3\1/2\ times, and drug crimes have gone up by 15 times. This increase in crime rates can be attributed to increased use of the death penalty and the increase in

Mr. President President Washington workers are seeing more and more of their wages cut every year. The effect is that Washington workers' wages have not kept up with the rising cost of living in America.  The typical worker in Washington earns about $23,500 a year. He or she is working longer and harder and paying more in taxes than ever before. The effect is that the average Washington worker now works 14 years longer than he or she did in the early 1970's.  This is the kind of situation that has to change. It is time that Washington workers' wages come up to keep up with the rising cost of living.  I understand that

In the words of Upton Sinclair, it is a megaphone for the rich. It does not really do anything to change the way the House works.  The bill goes beyond the regular appropriation process by imposing significant new spending requirements on Members and staff.

This incident was one of the most tragic events in the history of the Second World War.  In an effort to help resolve the problem, a small demonstration program was established in 1942 to test the depth of these mines. As part of the program, Canadian troops and
