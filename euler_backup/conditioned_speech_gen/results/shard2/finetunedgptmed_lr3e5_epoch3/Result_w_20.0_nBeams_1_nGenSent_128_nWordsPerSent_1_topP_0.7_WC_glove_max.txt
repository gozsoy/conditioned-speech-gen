Mr. President Defense primary care programs support more than 60 million people, and more than half of those are Medicare beneficiaries. Medicaid and Medicare provide essential health care to about 13 million people.  The legislation we are considering today creates a new entitlement program that encourages Medicare recipients to enroll in TRICARE, requiring TRICARE to notify enrollees if they enroll in a program that doesn't meet eligibility requirements.  The legislation mandates that enrollees enroll in TRICARE for up to 6 years. It requires enrollees to be responsible for the full cost of their prescription drugs, and it requires enrollees to maintain an annual wellness evaluation and wellness checkup.

They are a people who have endured unimaginable hardship. Many of these people have no land, no home, no friends, and no access to basic services.  On December 6, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled that Argentina was legally obligated to pay $400 million to the families of the Argentine citizen who was executed by the Argentinian military. It is not a bad decision, but it is a very, very shortsighted one. The Argentine Government should have waited for more time to receive compensation. The Argent

But the real issue here is the political impasse that has allowed the administration to walk away from the peace process and the American people to be able to stand on the side of Israel and stand with her and her people.  The reason we have an agreement on sanctions is to prevent a war. This is not the way to achieve peace. It is not the way to do

iraqi wing uss 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, Iraqi wing USS Starkweather was destroyed on April 23, 2006, when it collided with the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, carrying 10 members of the crew.  On that day, as we all know, we witnessed the destruction of a cherished family, a cherished naval unit, a cherished symbol of the United States, a symbol of freedom and liberty.  Today, we pay tribute to those sailors, the crew, and the families who have lost loved ones on that fateful day. It is with a deep sense of sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to those families, to pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the sailors

The White House has always required higher-level employees to complete a career in the White House, as do many in the Department of Defense. Achieving the career standard for a senior executive position is only a first step to getting a more permanent position.  I would like to know the reasons that the Department of Defense has not yet made a recommendation to the President for the appointment of a permanent White House liaison.

However, the fact of the matter is that the tax cut package, which would provide an average of $1,000 per family for families earning $75,000 a year, would be vetoed by the President, would not become law, and the tax cuts that he is pushing on the American people would be vetoed by the President.

Madam Chair, Alaska is our Nation's third largest State. We are the home of more than 50 species of fish and shellfish, which make up our food chain. We also have more than 100 different tribes, and our environment is under constant threat from invasive species.  Congress needs to do more to protect our oceans and our

In many cities, the control of local tax revenues is a central issue in their own affairs. This amendment seeks to increase the maximum amount that local governments can be reimbursed for the costs of local government contracts by a factor of 10.  In response to this problem, a similar amendment, H.R. 2740, was approved by the House last year. However, the Senate was unable to pass this legislation before adjournment.  The amendment I am offering today is very similar to that approved by the House last year.

Mr. President amendment No Money Spending: Section 602(a) of the Balanced Budget Act requires that $1 billion in outlays not be used to pay for a tax cut, a tax increase, or any other legislative activity.  The amendment is simple. It requires that money spent by the Federal Government not be spent to pay for a tax cut, a tax increase, or any other legislative activity. It does not allow a new entitlement or a new tax to be added to this spending.  This amendment is the best chance we have to help keep the government operating. It does not cost a dime.  In fact, I believe it is

Mr. Speaker Speaker, the IRS scandal continues to resonate across our Nation. Our constituents are furious with the IRS. They have heard the rumors that IRS agents have abused their power and violated the constitutional rights of innocent taxpayers.  Last week, the IRS admitted that their actions were inexcusable. And it is shameful that the IRS is dishing out gratuitous punishment to those who cheated.  I want to commend the IRS for correcting the situation. I believe the IRS has made a mockery of the constitutional rights of innocent taxpayers. They have disgraced the IRS, and the IRS should be ashamed of itself.  I urge the IRS to correct the IRS
