Mr. Chairman, this is a $1 billion military coup in United States foreign policy, a move which is unfair, wrong, and a disgrace to this body.  I believe we need to spend money on the military because we need to have troops to fight terrorism. This is an expensive endeavor, and I do not believe we should spend $1 billion on a country which will not use the money we give them to build or maintain their military.  I believe in democracy. I believe in free and fair elections. I believe that the American people should be given a say on our foreign policy, and this bill does not do that.  We are

The security of our Nation depends on it.  But the use of drones is not one of those times. This is a terrorist tactic. This is not just about the sanctity of human life. This is about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  Congress should not be allowing these deadly, unprovoked attacks to occur. It is simply wrong. We should never allow the executive branch to launch strikes against Americans without clear, rational, and specific military strategy.

sergeant department chairman 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the chairman of the subcommittee and in support of his amendment which would strike the Department of Defense Corps officer sergeant major provision in this bill.  The gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] is correct in stating that the provision in the bill will affect a limited number of officers, but the effect of the provision is to eliminate a number of vital programs that the American people have a right to expect the Department of Defense to operate. The Department of Defense Corps officer sergeant major program is one of those programs.  Mr. Chairman, I believe the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf] is right in stating that this

So the fact is that there is a crisis in South Africa. And it is not because the President and the President's Cabinet is incapable of managing a crisis, and it is not because they are failing in their responsibility.

Mr. Chairman, I would also like to point out that this legislation does not contain any of the problems that we have just seen with the other appropriations bills, but I think that we should not make the mistake of doing that here.

The Republican majority's budget proposes to spend $175 billion on the 1996-97 budget, which is nearly $2 billion more than the President requested.  While we cannot in good conscience continue to allow the Federal Government to spend money on unnecessary programs, I am disappointed that the Republican leadership has chosen to place this additional burden on the backs of our children.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker and my colleagues for the time this evening and for this very important special order this evening on breast cancer and to pay tribute to University of California, Los Angeles breast cancer patients and to the cancer patients that are invasive breast cancer patients in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to talk about the incredible bravery of this young woman and to share some of her personal experiences.  As the daughter of a physician who was in a medical school for many years, I have had the opportunity to see the strength and courage of these young women and to see their courage in coming forward.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece on the Nebraska Legislature's recent action to increase funding for community health centers and expand groundbreaking health care initiatives.  I want to commend the Nebraska Legislature for recognizing the need to increase funding for community health centers. However, I believe that the budget agreement that was negotiated by the Senate and the House is woefully inadequate to address the growing number of uninsured Americans.  Community health centers are an essential part of our health care system. The patients they serve are often the most vulnerable in our society. Health care providers have been unable to provide these patients with the comprehensive health care services

In the coming weeks, the Committee on Ways and Means will be holding hearings on how best to provide health insurance for children.

Now, the gentleman is a distinguished member of

I was impressed by their strong commitment to energy independence and a plan that provides certainty and stability to our economy and our families.

And when you add that to the $1.2 trillion in Medicare cuts, it is $1.2 trillion in cuts. That is a $1.

Mr. President, the Senate is considering the conference report on Public Law 104-30 to the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1995 Congress of which I am a part of the conference committee that will be the end result.  The provisions of the conference report are the result of a very long process, including discussions with the administration and Members of Congress. We have come to the conference committee agreement, with over 50,000 Federal employees who will be laid off as a result of this bill.  The employees affected are the ones who will be affected most by this measure. They are the employees who keep the public service open, who are on the

programs goals education 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I want to address the education goals that are included in this program, which is education, and the language that the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich] uses.  This program is a very important program. We are spending $1 billion over 5 years on this program. In order to help students, we have to make sure that the money is spent in the right way. We have to look at the conditions of the students.  I have a young girl in my district. She is from a very disadvantaged area of New York, and she is a student at Saint Mary's, a small school. Her family was very poor

Mr. Speaker, yesterday I came to the floor to talk about the steps that the Congress has taken to protect the public interest from waste, fraud and abuse. Yesterday the outcry was deafening from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to combat fraud and abuse in the government, to reduce fraud and abuse in the public, to protect the public interest, and we have not done that because this body and this administration have not done the work.  Today I want to talk about another issue that is so critical to the future of this country and to the future of the future of our children, and that

Continuing the progress we have made in reducing the budget deficit for the Federal Government, the subcommittee allocation for fiscal year 1996 was $1.689 billion for discretionary spending for the remainder of fiscal year 1996. Add the reserved funds in the Interior and Environment Appropriations bill for the next fiscal year to that amount, and the bill is still $1.869 billion. This represents a decrease of $88 million in fiscal year 1996.  The Appropriations Committee has increased this amount from the

This bill will devastate our economy, and the American people will suffer.
