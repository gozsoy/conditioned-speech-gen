Mr. Speaker, I would like to take just a few moments to recognize the extraordinary work of a friend, the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon]. The House of Representatives has been in session the last 3 days with almost no speakers. Mr. Speaker, there are three reasons for this extraordinary work of the House of Representatives on a national security bill as the priority bill that it is today, and that is, because the leadership of the Government has shown that it has not been called to operate at 1 a.m. for 2 weeks on a very serious bill that is the most important bill in the world which is

It was my understanding that this plan was sponsored by the Government of Texas and that it was in fact a dangerous attempt to impose a State government on the United States health care system. What I did not realize is that the State would be required to pay a California-like share for the health care provided to the residents of that State by its fellow citizens in exchange for a tax benefit for those who do not pay their fair share.

Mr. President, Senator Brownback just introduced his balanced budget amendment which would reduce spending to $500 billion. I would like to put the history on this as it was in 1967 when he introduced his so-called balanced budget amendment.

That money was sent to the States by the Federal Government in 1967 which had the fear of not being able to meet its obligations and was supposed to have had about $200 billion worth of debt in the General Government. But it was known then that $200

While it is difficult to understand the concept of this policy, one needs only to listen to the faces on Wall Street to understand how the administration believes that the need for effort should be given more priority than the number of people it is supposedly supporting.  For Americans who still struggle with job losses and wage stagnation, the concerns that investors have about this policy are clear. While the administration's response to some of its fiscal concerns has been constructive, the way in which

Mr. Speaker, last month the House will have the opportunity to make many historic and important decisions regarding the future of the Federal Government. We will have the opportunity to stop the build-up of the Federal Government into the size that it is today. We will have the opportunity to plan for the day that we will give control over the government back to the American people once again. In order to do so we must have a plan to achieve that plan.  Yet to accomplish that plan we will have to have meaningful legislation to bring people together, to resolve some of our differences, to help create stability and to work to bring about the kind of solutions needed

Mr. President, I join with Senators Grassley and Landrieu in the bipartisan resolution calling for the United States to take a more active role in solving global problems of human trafficking and child exploitation by human trafficking brokers and traffickers that took place in the United States over the last month or so. This resolution is an important step in ensuring that the President of the United States and our trading partners are taking action against these human trafficking traffickers.  In October 1996, the United States sent an international team to Hong Kong to confront human trafficking practices in the housing market. Since that time, we have heard a lot about the scandals and internal problems at Hong Kong housing authorities

Mr. Speaker, I have spoken in my 28 years in this House. But I am one of the minority. I think the majority has absolutely no issue with medical malpractice or equal rights for women or sexual assault victims or just about any subject we have a hearing on, or debate on. It is called a House rule, but they cannot do anything without the Speaker's consent or even in a series of bills.  The majority just wants to say whatever they want without anything coming out of committee. They do not want to be asked what their positions are. But what they are really doing is they are destroying their majority. They are their minority instead

Unemployment continues to rise across the country with the unemployment rate at the highest it has been in over a decade. Today we discuss how to bring back the American dream that is here for those who are willing to work and have the skills to succeed and the opportunity for a better life for their children and their family.  What better way to get these Americans to work than to strengthen the U.S. economic engine by making it more competitive and encouraging more companies to produce jobs in America?  I am proud of the Work Opportunity for America Act that this Congress passed that was signed into law by President Obama. I am also proud that

Mr. Chairman, let me make the point that we have made before on an amendment dealing with energy conservation that we are going to be having tonight with a similar amendment. We are going to be coming back to that issue.  Now let me say the amendment that was rejected in committee because the Energy and Commerce Committee had made some provisions regarding energy efficiency standards that would have kept us close to that goal that EPA provided for in this bill. They tried to make this a voluntary standard. This was the technical way to do it that is very harmful. There were, in fact, what are known as standard sets, EPA standards that would allow you to achieve

During the course of this fiscal year this Congress will spend approximately $500 billion more than last year's level and another $6 billion more than President Clinton asked for. But this is an increase of only $2 billion above last year. With the result that the increase will mean far less tax revenue for the government in fiscal year 1996 than the budget resolution would have it if all of the extra spending had been provided by the Federal Government.

This is a critical step forward for Americans to fight the challenges of protecting their families from the current tax rate increases and a beginning to increasing the revenue generated by those tax cuts for working families.

Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that the immigration debate in this House will be very difficult going on during the next Congress and the administration. Unfortunately, I would like to share with my colleagues some very clear warning signs that may come as a result of this debate that may prove to be a very disappointing experience for those that have already been in the United States.  The first rule I have offered this week provides for the consideration of bills introduced by House and Senate conferees which may or may not deal with immigration. I hope that this would not delay the committee's work, but I do feel it is very important to make the point that immigration

Mr. Speaker, since when did it become acceptable to attack the president of the United States of America and his legitimate domestic policy needs without any due process? Did anyone in this country care to defend the Constitution?  Today the Rules Committee introduced legislation to ensure that those seeking access to documents and other materials in their offices would not be held accountable for obtaining the information without proper authorization or consent.  The Rules Committee action is not a new development. It is the exact same process the Democrats have been using for years to try and ensure that their Democratic agenda is fully implemented.

So I stand ready to continue to work with him as he has been doing in the last few weeks and months to try to make this July 29 the last time he appears before the Senate as a Member of this body and to put in place a balanced budget resolution for 1995 and then to do the same in 1997 and 1998 so that next year the American people can have the confidence

The  inventory of important items for this year should be announced within the next hour or two, but at this point it appears that the legislation is not yet well over one-third completed. One of

The reason he said it was very similar was that they did not have any Democratic opposition on it because it was an economic bill that made business in America very happy

Last Friday afternoon it was school burnout that hit more than 8,000 school districts in the South and the Midwest, and the past week it has been more than 10,000 school districts that have seen a daily average of about 16,000 calls about fire incidents.

Mr. Speaker, last week in the world of energy, on the evening of January 13-14 President Bush held a huge press conference where he said that he wants to cut back the United States Government's already inadequate budget.  Well, we all know that it was less than a week later that this administration finally met its own deadline to do a Budget for America. But for some of us in the western world, who know the real face of waste and the deficit, there was still no budget for the future.  In the words of a reporter who covered this summit, ``Bush on Zero: What Else He Won't Tolerate.'' ``

The reason is because the legislation was not passed on a bipartisan basis, because there was not sufficient public input to form a consensus in the Congress, and because the majority of the Congress chose not to give tax breaks for the very wealthiest Americans.

Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Madam Speaker, I want to tell my colleagues the story of a man who I have often called a ``hero.''

After his retirement from the National Basketball Association in the early 1980's and early 1990's, he took time out to reenact the role of The Red Woman in the Men's Patriot Army where he played with the Red Sox for a decade, not least during their

Mr. Speaker, one of the most persistent problems facing our Nation is our health care system, a system that is not working for too many. It has been around for a long time and has made a lot of people miserable.  One of the ways to improve it is by reforming it so that it actually works. Unfortunately, this bill that we are considering today does just that. It is not a good bill at all. The health care of 17 million Americans will be left behind.  The bill will lead to 50 million Americans losing their health insurance in the first year alone. That is what it is going to do to an already overburd
