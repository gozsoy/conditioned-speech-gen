What has been very difficult for us to get our visa holders in every case has been the uncertainty about their ability to get into America. In fact, as an example, there are about 400,000 people who have been in Iraq. Not all of them are in Iraq. There are people who are living there illegally in what the

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, in January 2003 the United States was stunned by the attacks of September 11. Since then we have strengthened our security efforts against terrorist attacks. This amendment simply puts military forces on the front lines in a coup to replace local officials with CIA officers.  Our Department of Defense is closely monitoring the situation in Iraq. We are increasing the global presence of our armed forces by adding troops to Iraq. This amendment will only escalate the war. It is also a critical violation of international law.  We are headed into an argument on an amendment by my colleague from Texas (Mr

Madam President, as I have come to expect over the past year and a half in this Chamber to work on some of our most pressing national priorities--the Defense authorization bill and health care reform and our commitment to working with the international community to stop the spread of terrorist threats of all kinds--that is the way that this vote should have taken place when Democratic leaders offered the vote for direct election in the year 2000, we were faced with a dire choice.  For the Democrats, a choice of serious policy riders that were far too risky to consider going forward. A choice of an election year blanket against which a majority of us could vote because of our

After the ratification of the constitution, the property tax exemption grew to $40,000 annually, enabling Senator Hoekstra to make the critically important commitment to enhance local assistance to the National Park Service. He ultimately served as the State representative for Congress for 7 years.

Moreover, increases in unemployment rates indicate downturn recession and the impact of such an increase would not have a disproportionate impact on the cost of the Federal Medicaid Program.

While the President and the House Democrats were ordering the shutdown of the government and threatening to run up the national debt, the Democrats in the House had one default resolution they were going to pay for with their irresponsible shutdown of the government.  After the House had put a shut down on the government, the Democrats went right to work, working

Mr. President, this amendment is not intended to be a proposal to end funding for the Anti-Reverse Discrimination Act or the Congress of the United States. We are not trying to do anything to change the process or the rules that have been developed by Congress and the States to address a range of discrimination issues in the private sector today. They have been developed because manufacturers and employees want to be sure that they are doing their job within the law. I do not understand the effort to cause money to be cut off of this important process.  This amendment simply says that the Congressional Budget Office shall conduct an analysis of the Federal taxpayers' money being spent

I urge the House to treat the health care needs of these FDA employees, its employees in the Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Wisconsin/Wisconsin NATO industries, and our veterans like Paul Wamp as Members of Congress. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>I think it is really interesting that we think we can just create this whole thing about reforming the middle class and put more money in people's pockets but when we have the Congressional Budget Office score on the Senate bill that would actually cut back $1 billion a year in base and revenue for this bill, if you are on the Senate side and you are Speaker, we don't even want to look at it. It is very clear.  So it looks to me like it is not that they would be unwilling to debate it but the Democratic leadership would be unwilling to debate it.

Mr. Speaker, it is not that we do not want to have the courage to be the leaders in the world when it comes to this critical issue called climate change. It is that we have such a simple view to them that they would rather ignore the facts on how they are going to try to cover this issue up that is presented as evidence of science review.  In all fairness, there is no doubt that the bill before us to give congressional approval is to act on FCC regulations on broadband but it would be ludicrous to actually do that. I hope we can get this bill out. We just can't do it because of the American people.

Unfortunately, he ignored this request and has done nothing to notify Congress when consent will not be forthcoming.

Today is Tax Day, and some people may be interested to know that some States and even some fewer States on the Tax Code will offer to pay for tax cuts under this budget resolution. This means that States can offer such benefits as a personal tax credit or do not have to choose as much as they do now about how and how much it should be paid for intelligent tax reform.  The budget resolution gives States the option of spending money on tax cuts or on other items. In order to achieve the best interest of taxpayers, I think all Members should be closely watching what States do

Both gentlemen have led this effort to put a restriction on the amount of legal immigration into this country, and that is what the Oxfam Foundation has done by butchering what we have all tried to do for the last 8 years.  It is the fact that legal immigration is a by-product of a rotten system, and as the gentleman from Florida points out, we are here in

While the percentage of those who received college debt fell from 33 percent when President Clinton took office in January 1993 to 21 percent in March 1996, many of those levels exceeded 25 percent.  The impact on those who qualify for Pell Grants has been profound. The low-income Pell Grant program is the envy of any Federal student aid program. Only 5 percent of eligible Pell Grant recipients have received any form of financial aid.  Pell Grants are an efficient use of Federal

This legislation is an important tool to keep our country safe and secure, and I urge all Members of this House to support the Iran Sanctions and Economic Sanctions Act.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

President Bush has been strongly opposed to Bolton. The reason for this opposition is because he supports the resolution which we have just adopted which will put the United Nations on a path of elimination and which would essentially wipe out its entire Clean Air Act program.  In a July 19 letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell, Senator Thomas T. Inhofe of Oklahoma wrote, ``This of course is not a endorsement of Secretary Bolton or anything he does; but it certainly seems to me that the support

Mr. Speaker, let us start the month of February with an action in the first International Women's Day issue of the magazine of the Council for International Relations that I could find in the House at the time of the votes of the House and the Senate on the Small Business Jobs Act. The initiative which this issue represents is called ``Education of the Girls, Youth and Fathers Act.'' This initiative is worthy of our attention because it calls for a 10 percent increase in Federal funding to Title I programs for kindergarten through grade 12 in the fourth grade.  ``Equal Access, Equal Pay''  Today I believe that there is great promise and promise, however,

Mr. President, we know that Senator McCain and Senator Boxer have reached an agreement on an amendment and I am certain that Senator McConnell will vote for it if it is brought up on the Senate Republican side and not on the Democratic side. Let me say this now and say it again and again because I think it is important that people understand what the vote will be when we control the House of Representatives and are in control of the Senate in January. Republicans will vote to pass this most important legislative business politicians have had to offer in over 30 years in the middle of a Presidential election year.

That is what Speaker Gingrich is doing right now on the floor of the House of Representatives with the majority of his members not being in the Chamber. I know there are those, and I do not ask for a lot, but at least a little credit in the eyes of the taxpayers for that. I hope they will see it as part
