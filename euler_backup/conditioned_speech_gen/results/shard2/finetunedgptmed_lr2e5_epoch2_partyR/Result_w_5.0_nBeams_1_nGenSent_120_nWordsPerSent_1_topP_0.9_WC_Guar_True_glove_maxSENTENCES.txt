I would simply say that our country is in a vulnerable situation in rural America because of its population growth. Most of our schools and public schools in America are located on less than 1 percent of the land and therefore most of those schools are universal services that cover their entire district.

There are 1.6 million more Mississippians today than when the same population was there 4 decades ago.

There is no better time than now to support these recommendations to use our most important tool, the reserve funds, to address the Nation's defense and strategic missions.  There is a growing sense of anger about our budget problem that is emerging, and it starts with the frustration that our troops have received and their deployments are being pushed out, and it begins with the obvious militarization of our national security apparatus

But at the same time, they want to know whether the President is obligated to certify before Congress whether or not he

Time and time again, we have seen Federal spending grow over $1 trillion over discretionary spending, and we have seen the national debt rise to approximately $5.3 trillion, which is the largest Federal debt that our Nation has ever held.  Now, to add insult to injury, Federal spending is expected to be about $130 billion higher than last year, despite a significant decrease in the Federal deficit in the past few years.  This budget bill represents, for the first time,

Most Americans say that every time they think of the word `` burden `` they think of Uncle Sam paying for what Americans are going to do for themselves.  But a good gentleman from Rhode Island came up with the idea of helping Americans reduce their government spending. He called it ``the American tax credit.''  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This amendment takes a risk assessment component out of the base price of food and allows food companies to market their products without risk assessment cost centers in-hand. So they could literally have the disease tracking and the cost monitoring in their products. This is a commonsense approach that will improve the safety and the quality of food and beverages.  This amendment also takes a consideration of the rising cost of health care in our country. We know that in our country health care costs have increased 16 percent in the last year alone.

As President Bush commended State and local health care programs during his State of the Union address in February, he said: ``Nothing can stand in the way of these States taking greater responsibility.''

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment of the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, Mr. Chairman Price of Georgia, to provide $20 billion for the purpose of deficit reduction. The defense budget is not a wasteful enterprise. It is an essential component of the country's safety and security. We will face a balanced budget in 1997, which will be essential if the people of this country are to regain the prosperity that they experienced in the 1980's.  In particular, the budget is short in defense spending, particularly $24 billion in personnel accounts, approximately 30 percent of the overall budget.

Mr. Chairman, this is one of the most important appropriations bills that we are going to consider today and the chairman and the ranking member of the subcommittee have done a very good job of presenting it in a very fair way and particularly to the environment.

This bill provides about $63 million in EPA funds to clean up our Nation's estuaries.

It is a tax cut measure which I introduced, along with Senators Moran, Baucus, and Domenici, which is a product of exhaustive effort and much time, and has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. Speaker, these are not tax increases. These are Medicare cuts, and they are an incredibly bad idea.  They raise taxes on workers and a percentage of the earnings of those workers are going to the IRS, the IRS can very easily and improperly reward employers who work harder and do better,

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to repeal the ``Federal Law of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Amendments of 1994,'' FLCRA. This law was drafted with President Reagan in mind and does little or nothing to prevent fraud.  The FCRA, simply put, prohibits unfair business practices. It prohibits the practice of denying credit to the consumer based on certain factors. It prohibits predatory lending practices. It provides that the consumer should be presumed to have made the right decision in deciding to give credit.  Not surprisingly, FLCRA is, at its heart, the misnamed ``Fair Credit Reporting Act,''

These ideas and provisions, the minimum wage, the work-from-home provisions, the term limits and an open government, the Tax Code, and the regulatory reform will create many jobs and expand opportunities for all

Mr. Speaker, I am not sure whether the Speaker is aware that under the Congressional Budget Act Congress can choose not to tax citizens for using the products that we pay for through our taxes. This legislation does not prevent Congress from requiring all Americans to buy certain products that are produced under regulations that prohibit the use rules in the first place. It merely authorizes Congress to use the revenue that it receives from those revenues to determine what rules are allowed to be in place in the first place.  The legislation does not restrict manufacturers from employing new workers to produce new products to meet production standards as long as those products meet the

I think what the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Clinger] has done is a very thoughtful and necessary thing. We will be working very hard to get an agreement reached with the administration. But this would allow us to let the hearings happen. We have had some good hearings in this Chamber,

For the past 5 years or so Congress has paid more for money than the cost of the salaries and expenses of more than half of our Nation's law enforcement officers. I believe we will be paying over $1 billion in salaries and expenses in the next 5 years for our officers.  To see that the provision is paid for--the $1 billion for salaries and expenses is paid for, I would like to remind my colleagues of the fact that when we

It was a good one and a good thing for him to do.

Mr. Speaker, I have a question that is not addressed on this bill because there would not be a cut to veterans housing accounts under this bill. The Dole-Brownback budget request provides for $7 million for veterans housing maintenance and $1 million for checking accounts. There has not been any need for this for over 18 years.  So what I am asking is, Why are we cutting veterans housing accounts? Are we cutting VA hospitals and nursing homes? Is that because we have not had adequate funding to put together a VA system for the veterans? Are we cutting Alzheimer's and Parkinson's centers? Are

Madam Speaker, today, April 8, will mark the second anniversary of the second largest terror attack on American soil in recent history and the fourth largest attack in the Nation since September 11. The last terrorist attack on American soil occurred in Washington on July 11 of 2001, and it was the office of Senator Bob Dole where that very horrific attack took place. When asked why he asked Senator Bob Dole to investigate Reno, Nevada, he would say, ``That's the area we worked for,'' for Senator Dole, Bob Dole, had been working to investigate what had been going on in Reno, Nevada

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure be authorized to meet on Wednesday, March 10, 2003 at 10 a.m. in room SD-366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building to conduct a hearing on President Bush's plans to spend $13 billion of the Federal family tax credit to address the national congestion problems facing our Nation.  The high cost of transportation requires us to focus our responsibilities on improving and simplifying our Nation's infrastructure to move vehicles more efficiently, protect people's lives, reduce congestion, and reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions.  Today,

<|endoftext|>House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has long advocated an additional $500 billion in cuts in Social Security in this bill to help make up for the $15 trillion debt we now have to deal with next year if we want to continue to deal with the $16 trillion agreed to in a bipartisan agreement.  The plan includes spending cuts of $700 billion over 5 years, and there is no consensus plan of what we should be doing about these spending cuts. There is unanimous agreement that money that is coming in from dividends, interest, and for-profit subsidies is not going to get better spending cuts. So

Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing the Second Congressional District of South Carolina on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and I would like to take this opportunity to address the House for the first time in the Speaker's time here on the House floor to bring to the attention of the House and the American people the war in Iraq.  I think the American people know this war is one that has Commander in Chief General Petraeus. He has the job of leading our troops into battle against al Qaeda and insurgent insurgents that are spreading throughout Iraq, and his troops are having to face a very difficult task.  I

Mr. President, as President Trump prepares to address the Nation on the need for his legislative and executive agenda to preserve and protect our country from the threat of illegal immigration, he must be assured of the support of the Americans seeking to make America great again. I yield the floor.  The arta qui non of legislative proposals is to approach it with candor, even if we don't know all the facts. We should expect those who stand in the way of candor to withhold their candor in consonance with candorum est deceivers est deceivers est deceivers est deceivers est deceivers est 6:08

The vessel is a quad cab submersible about the size of a five- shafts car, and weighs only about 150 pounds when complete. It is an exhibit on the first year of the research drive to erect a three-dimensional aeromagnetic magnetometer in the world.  The vessel was launched with a few 100-pound payloads in an MDAO Ion and Magnetometer flight test, thus making it the

Madam Speaker, just a little more than 2 years ago, Congress passed the balanced budget amendment for the first time in over a generation to the Congress' rules committee. That first year at least the big programs that cost so much were contained and the big debt, in many cases, was contained. For the first time in a generation we enacted a new entitlement program that has actually cut discretionary spending, dramatically reformed entitlement programs, and offered a significant reduction in new spending.  Well, of course, Madam Speaker, there were some familiar faces on both sides of the aisle who came out with the first budget deficit
