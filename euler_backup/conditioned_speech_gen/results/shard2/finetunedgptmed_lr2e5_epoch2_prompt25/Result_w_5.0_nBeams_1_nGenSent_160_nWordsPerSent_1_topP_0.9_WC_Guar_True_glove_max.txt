north airport memorial 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Timothy McDonald and Deb Schott, who both tragically perished in a helicopter crash at the Brainerd airport in North Dakota.  In the early morning hours of Memorial Day weekend, in just 11 days, Airport Executive Officer Tim McDonald and Pilot Deb Schott, who was working for American Airlines, were conducting a training mission when they lost control of their aircraft and crashed. Twenty-six people, including two air traffic controllers, were killed and more than 250 were injured.  Earlier in the week, it was reported that Timothy McDonald had been told by his mother that his son had undergone a heart bypass operation and his only option would be to take his own life. He was just 19 months old.  My thoughts and prayers go out to Tim's family and friends as they continue to grieve this terrible loss.  Mr. Speaker, Tim McDonald and Deb Schott have made North Dakota proud and their

Madam President, I rise in support of S. 476, a bill I introduced 1 year ago, to reauthorize the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Establishment Act, a program that serves as a Federal fish and wildlife agency and educates public officials about Federal funding and cooperation in coastal restoration. This unique program, authorized in the 1906 Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, offers unique opportunities for government officials to build trust and have knowledge in establishing new and stable public land trusts to manage important recreational resources, as well as the land owned by our local communities. This opportunity is underfunded.  I applaud Senator Hatch, Senator Alexander, and Senator Kerry, as well as Representative Hansen and his staff, for their tireless work in introducing this commonsense bill.

rules amendment bill 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment strikes at a vital part of the bill and its adoption would gut the bill and create new Federal regulations that are necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare in our country without Federal oversight and enforcement of the rules and regulations. If adopted, the amendment would result in billions of dollars in unintended and costly spending for State, local and tribal governments.  My amendment would be very simple. It strikes the section at issue that allows the EPA to waive the minimum drinking water standards that EPA sets for certain industries in order to get a waiver from EPA. Currently, EPA determines the minimum water quality standards for pesticides to protect public health based on the risk of illness and harm to humans and the production costs of those pesticides. EPA then determines that the acceptable levels of these products are the equivalent of the concentrations that cause bacteria to be killed in the water and that these levels are not jeopard

This year there were only five of those as part of that process that we have not had in years past. We have at least six now that we do have before us but only one or two of which have the level of concern that I would like to find had the United States of America held the full and open and responsible Congressional American hearings that they had under the last administration.  I think, for those who are trying to make this Missouri Republican go away and dodge the Dakota situation that we have had under the last administration and the Illinois system under the last administration and the Michigan system under the last administration, you do not really, at least I would suggest, give it as much attention as you ought to in this process.

It does not say Congress has immunity. It does not say Congress has the duty to enforce laws passed by Congress, or to enforce laws enacted by Congress passed without amendments by the Congress, because there is legislation with jurisdictional application here.  I think it is very important we not get bogged down on what is in the bill as it has been crafted. What is contained in the bill that does constitute jurisdiction in any event?

The fact is that most of those folks, I think, probably had an obligation to serve in the U.S. Congress, but to live their lives in communities that have kids like mine who grew up in some of the poorest parts of our country, I think they are entitled to know that their local elected officials, if they happen to be Republican, are supposed to be using some of the same resources and the same tools that their parents did and that the same tool that

It would not be fair for those of us in California to continue to farm our way through this time without the strong support of the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in making this important investment.

Mr. President, I think what we have seen here this morning is that there are consequences from policies. This administration has presided over significant policy reversals over the last decade which have cut spending on children and on the most vulnerable in our society so that we are now $20 trillion in debt which we are spending at twice the rate of GDP in this country today for just one afternoon of morning-after parties and for four months of the year. For half the budget it takes just 2 percent growth in GDP to help us recover from this economic downturn. That is the consequence of the administration's misguided policies.  Mr. President, the Federal deficit this year will be $219 billion. Let me just give one illustration of the impact of the administration's policies on this budget.  We are talking about $4,800 this year in Medicare part A costs. This is what we face as a result of the new Democratic majority in this country

Madam Speaker, this week, ExxonMobil reported it beat its own record for the highest annual profits ever recorded by any company with its net income for the week ending June 6, 2004. In addition to this staggering profit total, ExxonMobil earned an additional $4 billion in company stock that was sold to its shareholders as compensation for their stock holdings in the oil company in the week ending June 6, 2004. These additional dollars of stock will contribute to the energy companies share price at the end of the month, although the current share price is $32 a barrel below the December trading price.  While ExxonMobil has enjoyed a record-setting performance during the past 6 weeks, nothing compares to the disgraceful actions of the Iraqi Government, which has not only failed to prevent production of oil from reaching its citizens but has also resorted to crippling and sometimes even torturing their own people to obtain the energy they need for their lives.

iraq cuts home 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, tomorrow the United States House of Representatives will vote to borrow $75 billion as an emergency supplemental: some of the funds to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. And yet another such massive cut to this vital public-private partnership that is America's biggest home.  The disparity in government funds is absolutely astounding, particularly when we consider that fewer than a fifth of the families in America make over $75,000 a year.  Before the Federal Reserve finished its bail-out and mowed the lawns on Wall Street, a family that is in the top quintile in the United States paid about 20 percent of its income in interest payments. Today, two-thirds of that $60,000 is financed through the earned income tax credit. So here we are proposing the largest tax increase on a part of the American family for more than a decade, and no effort to improve those expenses.  These are not the Americans

Today we are going to be considering a bill called the Forest and Wildlife Conservation Act of 2006. This bill is about more than just wildlife in this country. This bill is about public health and public safety. It is about clean air and clean water in this country. It is about a strong military that has Perry Army Depot as its major operations base. It is about a growing economy. This bill ensures that a strong military is an essential part of that economy.  That is why this bill is so important. This bill is about making sure that we protect public health and public safety. It is about keeping the United States a leading environmental superpower.

Normally I would support that amendment on its merits because of its public purpose to bring an end to the political turmoil in Cambodia which has been going on for many years and has now caused it to be a country of massive political unrest.  However, because the foreign military financing that would be cut by the amendment is critical to Cambodia's peace negotiations which Cambodia is trying to establish, I cannot support this amendment in its present form because of the political coup at the center of Cambodia.  Mr. Chairman, Cambodia has the reputation throughout the world as the most repressive, dictatorial and unsafe country in the world. That reputation is still with us today. Since 1980, 1.5 million people have been arrested and millions of others persecuted for whatever reason, based on their political beliefs, social rank, religion, ethnicity or political

students federal march 

Final sequence: 

Madam Chairman, I want to commend Chairman Miller for getting out ahead of the student lending issue before it becomes a full-fledged crisis. In March, the Federal Reserve sent a warning about student loans to lenders across the country. At the time, they expressed concern that this would be a case in which the high cost of a college education could place an undue strain on the student loan market and in April July they began to take a new march on lender lending. In September, the Bush administration signaled a new interest in ensuring financial assistance to borrowers. Then, we saw in October 2001 another administration hint of an interest in encouraging private lenders to lend to students.  Now, there is some time to go. I will not use that time. But let us be clear about the issue we are talking about, and the amendment that is pending before the House that would move us in that direction. This amendment would create a new program to allow higher education institutions

Today the National School Lunch Program is one of the most successful programs of the day. I hear that all the time and read the comments of other Members on that point. I believe this amendment does represent an improvement.  What is extremely important for us to remember is that school lunches in this country are often the source of children's nutritional needs as well as the nutrition programs themselves. The children who serve our country in the military have a special need for food, and therefore they rely on these school meals for the vast majority of their meals. The nutrition programs do not necessarily provide the nutrition the children need and we

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, we are staring at an approaching disaster. Again, we face a disaster that will largely affect the poor, underprivileged, elderly, and handicapped. Again, Congress is being asked to do things that would probably never be done in this country if it were not for the protection of the environment and the poor as well as the poor as a whole from top-down or middle-class or high-income taxation and the possibility of confiscation of their possessions and families, as was the case with the use of the IRS for 4 years and the transfer of other property to the rich and by the Government just simply stealing.  What is interesting about this disaster is that this year marks the fifth anniversary of the worst flood in the history of the Western United States. Unfortunately, we live in an environment that demands from us these 5 years as the poster children for how vulnerable we are to flooding.  I yield the floor and ask my colleagues to join me in expressing

Mr. Speaker, these are tough times for the White House--Nussbaum, Hubbell, Watson, Altman, and Hanson. These people were going to help President Clinton provide a budget surplus, but they were told by the administration that it was not possible because the Joint Economic Committee took the numbers they were going to send to the White House and turned them into a few hundred thousand dollars here on Capitol Hill that could not possibly be spent because the numbers were so enormous that they could not possibly have the people they needed to aid the Haitian Government come forward.  Now, the second largest thing in this budget is the Dole estate tax cut that is going to be reduced by $19 billion because of the Clinton administration which happens to coincide with hemisphere-wide bad weather. That is not going to help the President get reelection because if he is going to get reelection he is going to have to deal with Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster Webster hubbell

Madam Speaker, this afternoon the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity of the Committee on Financial Services will begin hearings on President Bush's visionary plan to begin to address the most pressing housing need in the United States today, and that is the availability of affordable housing in this country for all Americans. Speaker and Chairman Mfume will be here to hear from the chairman of the subcommittee on Monday afternoon.  I want to take a moment and talk about one of the provisions in this bill that I think is of great importance to millions of Americans. It has always been my goal in this House to pass legislation in the House that is smart and efficient and goes forward in the spirit of compromise, and that is to facilitate the use of private housing. So on Monday, when the Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities holds a hearing on this bill and we get to the aspects of the bill on a bipartisan basis, we will have a good bill.

Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other side of the aisle may not be writing much environmentally friendly legislation, but they certainly are good at getting in touch with their middle class supporters and doing nothing in the real world to combat climate change.  This bill they are bringing out today is so simple and so carefully crafted that it treats one way of living the extreme ways of climate change, to the detriment of all those it purports to help.  The bill cuts taxes for the wealthy, goodies for oil and gas companies and helps corporations to take more money from their public pension funds. It says nothing about carbon pollution from factories, refineries and vehicles, cuts new spending on clean energy, and it squashes labor protections, and it takes big steps toward rationing health care.  Mr. Speaker, this bill calls for a clean, reliable energy source, but it moves us away from more sustainable use of renewable energy. It cuts away

The Somali Regiment is a unit of the Security Forces of the United States that plays an important role in support of the United States Southern Command.  These events bring home the stark reality that young Americans across the country are at great risk, both in our own country and overseas.

I believe, from my conversations with numerous industry leaders in my State of Colorado, that we need to start laying out a long-term plan to produce substantial private sector job growth, to stimulate private sector investment and, of course, stimulate economic growth.  There are the economic alternatives which my colleague from Ohio--and I do appreciate his leadership on these--are advocates for. That is not to say that not every one of those are a bad idea.

I agree with the Senator from Nevada. It is disturbing to see the responses. First, the response that this bill actually doesn't increase taxes; it actually cuts taxes. Now there is some suggestion that this is a call for a higher income tax or a lower income tax or some other interpretation that this is more in the right place or in the wrong place for a joint-earner family to be able to provide for their family or themselves or their children. But that is a false interpretation for a variety of reasons that it has a lot of Web sites out there that are very clear about the advantages of it, that this is a relief from taxation; and so I believe it is best for the family to just pick up the tax burden in the future if you are fortunate enough to have that reduction in taxes.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

law emergency problem

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be part of this special order, because 45 percent of the fatalities on our Nation's highways are alcohol-related.  We need legislation addressing this problem. We must pass legislation that will address both the needs of law enforcement and emergency medical personnel on the highways, as well as make them safer.  Two years ago, the largest alcohol-related fatality was a motorist who hit and killed a baby carriage with 55 people inside. One of the largest areas of highway fatalities is found in the central Great Plains, south and east of the city of Chicago, with excess capacity on highways. That is just the tip of the iceberg.  A GAO report released this month found that crash tests that are conducted when the cold weather turns to cold weather again tell us what we need to know about the safety on our highways. Because of the effect of cold weather on our aging highways, we have more seriously deteriorated or

That is the kind of thing women need to consider before they make that decision.  We had one Republican here, the gentleman from Kentucky, Mark Whitaker, who came here to talk about health care. We were beginning to talk about the Republican health care plan for one thing, not even for another.

But I do want to talk about an important issue, the Japanese obligation to their Asian neighbors.  My colleagues know that Japan has the second largest and strongest military of any country in the world. It has been the world's superpower since the early 20th century. It has been viewed with great admiration by most in Asia, but, increasingly, increasingly as the world becomes more multipolar, it has become a target of increasing nationalism and to some extent by anti-Americanism. This shift in thinking has raised the stakes for Japan with regard to our Asian neighbors.  A few months ago, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement

overdue cost year

Mr. Speaker, from 2001 to 2006, the cost of higher education exploded in this country. It went up 40 percent, destroying the dreams of too many Americans and leaving millions out in the cold in need of a college education. We need to end this past year's tuition increase now, and we need to get our cost of higher education under control for the first time in decades, rather than just increasing it, just to pay for bills we have already incurred.  When we increased the cost of loans for credit card debt for borrowers to pay overdue bills at PLUS loans in 2006, students defaulted on their loans by an average of 50 percent. In the short term, they did not have a chance to repay their loans. This was under a student loan program that had been, I think, fatally flawed for a long time. This was a system which was picking winners and losers in the market. And, most importantly, it was not working

In fact, it would force many more Americans to choose between self- cincinnati or driving on bad roads to a friend's house, rather than by shifting them to use our country-of-origin fuel to help fuel our Nation's destructive gridlock.  The bill before us would require some 180,000 miles of interstates per year, 80,000 miles of highways to be built, 5,000 miles of new bridges, 25 new tunnels, and 3 new rail crossings, but that's not the end of it.

Once again we are reminded that, despite the difficulties of many in this troubled region, many on both sides of the political problems in Lithuania are optimistic about the future of Lithuania. Russia has a problem with Lithuania's unquenchable thirst for Russia energy which will never be satisfied even with Russian gas supplies. That is why in early 1995 the United States and Lithuania signed a free trade agreement on a line of up to 95 billion cubic meters of natural gas. I commend President Clinton for his leadership in reaching this agreement and to Senator Coverdell, who also deserves credit for his leadership on the issue of natural gas.  Now more than ever, we are reminded that Lithuania's future is linked to its own democratic values.

These troubling results and the lack of transparency in which they are coming from are why I have filed a discharge petition to stop this nomination.  Mr. President, it is outrageous that this Wall Street corruption inquiry is taking place.

Absolved. This is the Bybee memorandum that was the basis for much of the torture activity that took place. A substantial part of it was a direct quote of Senator Dole on the floor of the Senate. It went over to the Speaker of the House in this very minute if you could just look up to see it. That should not be put into the Record because this would be a significant impact that would be enormous and significant in that there would be significant damage to the value of property that would be substantial and significant.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

What I would say to the gentleman from California is this: that the Congress of the United States has, for almost a quarter of a century now, been operating under the same principles we are operating under today because it is the right thing to do and it is good for the country to keep a record of its finances so that we know what we are doing here today to keep our economy working and job creation going in this Nation that we are in. It is that difference that makes this all possible and that makes this so much more than a quarter of a century and a half since we have had a balanced budget. I say that not only to the gentleman but to all the members of the committee that we serve, including the minority. We serve on both sides of the aisle in this House, and we appreciate the fact that they are working in a way that has produced the balanced budget that we have in the first place, because it

If they can afford it, we can cut that out of this person's life in a reasonable period of time.

As the Senator has stated, the amendment before the Senate will only temporarily halt the construction of the new Government Federal building project in Little Rock. The funds should be added to the $5.5 billion for the modernization of the Federal building now proposed for Little Rock instead of coming out of a $3 billion money-losing construction appropriations bill.  I think a number of Members want to keep this project alive as a target for fiscal year 1996, and I think the other side of the aisle, Mr. President, wants the project terminated.  My offer was to offer that amendment last night, and at that time we could debate on it tomorrow at a time to be determined, but I would like to proceed for the moment without having the opportunity to discuss it further, and at a later time let the amendment come to a vote.

We cut $12 million from NREL and we give it to the Department of Energy Research and Engineering, which is one of the two good things that has come out of the President's budget, and we cut the other one.  We also cut the Office of Science and Technology, OST, within the Department of Energy. We cut that from $103 million to $47 million, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, or NREL, is also of interest because it is a small business owner-run laboratory, a direct competitor to OST. They will be given an additional $200 million to maintain and expand a full-time laboratory at DOE. So NREL is not tied directly to this.

So we would expand the tax incentives for small businesses.  I believe we should make a decision on that tax issue and perhaps the issue of small business expensing. So to wrap up, Mr. Chairman, this is the way we should put this in the bill. You just referenced tax cuts. We all know we are going to talk about tax cuts in the next couple of minutes.

This amendment does not increase taxes because it does not increase revenues deficit spending deficit spending surplus. It simply seeks to set up a mechanism that you can do so.

We are going to use the whole crop of wheat in 1996 when prices are as high as they are. There will be a lot of some people who will ask, Well, why is there not an equal gentleman from California on the committee of Agriculture who has an area of special interest?  So I guess you have an equally important situation in that regard. But the point of this particular amendment is that it seems to me the gentleman's objective is to influence Congress and actually to ensure that one State is advantaged. I think that is wrong.

I will not oppose the bill on this side of the aisle because I understand the Appropriations Committee has been sensitive to President Clinton's request for emergency appropriations for the District of Columbia Government during the last Congress. I agree, in fact, that the continuing resolution amendment offered by my colleague from Virginia in early July was a fair resolution of this problem. While the District of Columbia is to blame for the emergency funds, I am not prepared to cast any blame on the President for the Federal funds this crisis precipitated.  While I support the goals and ideals of the government contract law in the District, the funding levels in the conference report to accompany H.R. 6102 which funds the District Government is almost $8 million below the appropriated levels for 1995, and $4 million below the $50

That measure passed the committee by a unanimous vote of 12 to 3 and will now move to the full Senate floor for amendment. The bill will allow for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue market access grants for renewable electricity projects and will authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to conduct a program to help State and local officials develop alternative and affordable energy resources across State lines. Arizona is a very critical area for building new power lines because of its significant renewable electricity resources, but is not one of the 50 States that has been subject to a renewal of the Federal Power Act.  With all due respect, the issue of renewable electricity is a complicated one for me. I am always at odds with this administration over its policies toward renewable energy.

I want to make clear that I strongly support the President's goals of increasing the research and development tax credit. I understand that H.R. 1628 provides a larger number of tax credits for this important research and development tax credit that were previously offered in last year's Commerce bill. I also know that that bill left room for Shawn Ashworth to offer an amendment later this week which would extend the expensing provisions to lease aircraft. I believe it is crucial that our Federal aviation programs be fully protected.  In addition, I believe that a reduction in research and development tax credits should not in any way be offset by a provision which does not assist small businesses, including mine, in developing their own commercial jet aircraft.

But I am not here today to suggest that those two amendments that were debated today in committee today were not very good amendments. But I must say to the gentleman from Texas

Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute and to honor a young man who was recently killed in action in Iraq--1LT Adam G. Mooney, age 20 years of age. This is a particularly difficult time in the life of this young man today. He is one of those soldiers whom we will remember and will always respect for his action in Iraq. His family and many others in this body and around the world will be here for all of us who were in the country at that time when he died in Iraq fighting for our country in a very deadly and deadly ambush killed by insurgents, insurgents from whom he was traveling.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is not fair to these people that they need the Speaker to stand up and tell them to do this because it does not take a lot of thought or a lot of compromise to get this bill that we are now dealing with signed because what the rules do is they mean this:  The right of an individual to choose his or her own doctor is a human right. He or she can choose his or her own physician. It is not up to us to tell people how to do their own health care or what is best for them. It is up to the States to provide the best medical treatment for all citizens, regardless of age or physical ability or ability to pay.  Under this bill,

Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the gentleman from Florida, his conduct on the Rules Committee, him working with the minority on a number of bills. But the example he gives here that it is important to have your Members be involved is the work that we have done on one of these as a committee in the last Congress to add some authority to our committees so that they can take action as committees that can be informed of what is going on and have some oversight so that we can conduct our oversight of the legislative process in this institution. And the gentleman from Florida is correct in his point that there is a point where there ought to be some board on the outside to Hawaii or Washington that is empowered to read that report.  So I hope that will be the approach we take in the Rules Committee next year and in this Congress in the future to try to push Members to participate more in this process, and to do it together, and to have the

Mr. Speaker, Democrats were proud to join Republicans yesterday in passing many necessary procedural reforms. Those reforms continue the work begun by Democrats to make Congress more accountable and more responsive to the American people. As Speaker Pelosi said yesterday in House floor action, today it is going to be a week like last week that we are going to see a lot more of what we have always called the public price at play. As President Clinton said yesterday, we are going to find a lot of Members from both sides of the aisle who will express concern about each other.  Members will express concern that Members with the opportunity--because we have passed the legislation that will put people back to work--who put the Americans back to work will not take advantage of that opportunity. So we are doing something today to correct that fundamental error. Members should recognize that the leadership, the Speaker of the House, the minority leader, the minority whip have done exactly what they did

It is imperative that we continue to work with the President and Congress to develop an economic policy that works for everyone and not just our economic well-being. The balanced budget amendment is the first and most effective tool we have to address the deficit and to help our economy become more productive, competitive, and efficient.  The tragedy of the matter is that the President of the United States, Mr. Obama, prefers to continue a failed economic policy that has inflicted our economy on the backs of hardworking Americans.

I am not saying this has been all that is in the crime bill because there are some improvements to prisons which have been made in that bill and will continue to be made in that bill and other areas of its consideration for which we are making improvements in facilities and such things, but there are in some ways not as many opportunities to make crime a nonviolent offense--``no offense.'' There are still very little opportunities to do that, no matter how well-intended as they are. We simply cannot protect nonviolent offenders in the eyes of the law.

Mr. Chairman, when the original Voting Rights Act passed this House, it was to correct voting discrimination evident in the 1964 Presidential election. The legal right to vote has always been an important and fundamental American right to the American people. It is a right that has been and will continue to be a part of our Constitution as it is today. But the House leadership and this Chamber should never abuse its responsibility to protect this right, especially in the context of elections that are supposed to be just and fair for all Americans. That is why we need oversight by an independent commission appointed by this Congress to ensure that every act of legislation or court proceeding is being done in an effective and timely manner so that all Americans can participate fully in the democratic process.  The underlying bill before us today would do exactly that. We are in the midst of a Presidential election year, and the work of the independent congressional commissions is one more opportunity for the Congress to intervene to

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my chairman. H.R. 2715, the Paperwork Elimination Act of 1995 is a very important bill for small and large businesses alike. It is important to protect small businesses from the financial burdens of Government regulations on Federal regulations. But legislation dealing with small businesses will not suffice to address the new forms of Government regulation that have become commonplace in this century, and there is a need to reform the legislative process that yields these changes.  The Paperwork Elimination Act of 1995 not only moves us closer to addressing this important issue, but it goes one step further. While we will never eliminate all Federal regulations, we should come close to minimizing the size and complexity of this new and ever-growing regulatory system. It is time to do our job to avoid its worst-case scenarios. The bill before us today is the next step in our effort to do that

Mr. Speaker, S. 35 transfers jurisdiction of approximately 200 acres of public land from the United States Army Corps of Engineers to the Department of the Interior to the purpose of requiring the National Park Service to conduct a coastal plain study and land protection effort for the Northern Mariana Islands. The area of the Northern Mariana Islands that will be included in the Coastal Plain Study includes two hills of the northern end of the island called the Kaalalau Highway and an area called the Armed Forces airstrip.  The Department of the Interior and the State of Hawaii originally signed an agreement in 1983 to protect these two hills and airstrip for the residents of the northern part of the island. In 1984, the Department of the Interior completed a study that noted the proximity of these areas to the Department of the Interior's natural resources for geologic purposes, and in 1987 the Department of the Interior commenced

I believe many people watched or saw with horror the news stories of Cameron as he and other brave law enforcement officers laid the course for law enforcement in Kentucky and in the country to freedom in the wake of the school shooting at Columbine High School in 1999.  Cameron and his wife, Cindy, and his fellow officers lost their lives that day in service to the citizens of their home State of Kentucky and the country. Navy veteran Michael Randall Taylor and Brent Thompson had just been released from jail on parole for a 1999 sex assault conviction when the unthinkable happened.  Later that day, Cameron and his fellow officers were on their way to a help a family member who had fallen down a flight of stairs. However, as they approached the victim, a lone gunman rushed in. By accident, two rounds were fired, Cameron's pistol, and it discharged.

Not long ago, it was a beacon of righteousness, an important part of our national history, and a transportation corridor. It provided the first link between the Texas Pacific railroad and the Will Rogers State Fair in 1936, and in the 1950s and 1960s helped the route cross the mountains on the way to the Kenosha Speedway.

This bill will help improve the way we regulate prescription drugs because it will give FDA the tools and the time it needs to protect the public from drug companies' unfair and deceptive practices regarding information that is freely available on the Internet.  Under current law, drug manufacturers and drug wholesalers may not market prescription drugs through the Internet without obtaining FDA approval first. This weakens the Federal drug safety program and creates a failed rulemaking process. By a vote of 86 to 3, the Senate overwhelmingly supported this measure.  The proposal contained in S. 830 is very straightforward. Under it, FDA can require prescription drug companies to register or obtain written consent from their doctors before they will distribute drugs through the Internet. Under the bill, prescription drug companies and wholesalers who are not required to register will

Mr. President, I simply want to express my appreciation to the distinguished Senators from Hawaii and Alaska for accepting the amendment. I do think we ought to pursue this issue and correct it in the future because there is some very severe concern about its possible effects on the State of Alaska and in the State of Hawaii and this has been an issue that I think should be addressed in the future in the responsible way of changing the current rules so that they are more consistent with what other States are dealing with and so on. I think it ought to be done seriously because it is not excessive. I think we should at least recognize that this is an issue that is very important in the State of Hawaii and I know it is a very important issue in Alaska and what is being brought here.  I hope the Senator from Hawaii will withdraw his amendment, or we can consider that as a new amendment, or we can amend this later so that it actually conform

The Center for Immigration Studies just released a study by Wallace Huffman, who is a professor at the University of California at Berkeley that challenges the President's executive order that is still in effect today and that does the following: First, it has the effect of stymieing the center from enrolling that many of its own people at these two centers on H-2A visas because those people will not come to that particular city if they do not have a sponsor who can sponsor them to that particular country that they respond to. That is the message the President is sending to the Chairman of the Board. It is just different than a couple of other administrations and it is not about the human rights issue.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, as we head into the final days of the health care reform debate, two major proposals are emerging from the pack: The first is a policy of Federal mandate on the States to cover the uninsured. The second is an agreement with the Congressional Republicans that coverage of the uninsured in the States will be mandated through a Federal plan which would be a patch on a broken system that the President says he does not want and the Speaker of the House says she does not want. The problem is they both require the federal Government to be the body that falls on the backs of its fellow citizens and for the first time there are really two sides to this.  The first side claims that they want to protect the rights of the individual citizens who want to choose health insurance because health care is such a personal right. But what happens if they control Federal health care, with all of its mandates? Then the State's own leaders have to operate under their

Now we have this measure before us that was made law as House Resolution 1580 because it was the Simpson-Schumer substitute that passed by voice vote in the other body without any public debate or any cost to taxpayers or citizens of this country because our bill, which is being taken up to take up to 30 hours to consume, has been passed on a voice vote by the House with overwhelming bipartisan support.

The Conyers amendment would retain all funding for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and would restore funding for the Agency for International Development and the National Science Foundation in the last year of this bill by an additional $150 million over the President's request for this critical agency support. This amendment is the product of a genuine commitment to the fight against the spread of terrorism and the counter of Iran and its efforts to achieve a nuclear capability that will threaten the security of the United States and that will be a statement of the true character of the U.S. national interests.  After a large-scale disruption in Iraq in March, when a car bomb hit a crowded marketplace, people became acutely aware of the critical security needs in the homeland in the post-9/11 era.

This is childless families, families whose children have failed to secure the safety and security of an adequate wage and education. I am not all that comfortable with the Clinton plan, although I must vote for it. In the end, however, the Clinton plan will provide many of the same benefits as today's welfare system.

That is right: the so-called system that has made health care for American families easier and more convenient is about to be turned against the American people for the first time in their lives because they pay their health insurance premiums monthly instead of payment in full. That is not how we intended to do this. But, when Speaker Gingrich was forced to reverse this, it was a slap in the face of millions of Americans.

rise dutch support 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 89, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be set aside for the dedicated support of our Nation's most decorated veterans and their families by designating March 5 as ``National Military Appreciation Day.'' While most of us take this day to rise in support of our Nation's military and their service men and women, the people who have fallen in the armed services will go into a separate day to honor the families and the veteran who lost their life in the service of our country. The Dutch Veteran Bill of Rights recognizes these sacrifices, while affirming the American tradition of the veterans to serve as they have proudly defended our freedom. We must honor the memory of our fallen veterans and honor their sacrifice and service in giving them peace and well-being. By recognizing this resolution today, the House of Representatives honors the sacrifices of all those who have sacrificed for this country

Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio raises a very important question. I may offer an amendment to basically have an inflation factor built in so that if we are doing something like this we can measure exactly what is happening in inflation over a period of time so we can get some sense what we are doing and make some recommendations to the rest of the Nation as to what we should do to make sure we have basically a competitive economy. I support that idea as the basis for a reform of the Small Business Administration and if offered as a substitute to the Dole bill in the future for the time being I will support that effort in the next few weeks and in the next several months and in the years built off this kind of thing.  But what the Senator from Ohio wants to do is say do not do this. Have inflation factor and all this kind of stuff, but we cannot do it precisely because of a very substantial split in the procedure

Mr. Chairman, I am a traditionalist. My entire life's environment and upbringing have created within me a respect for traditional values. Theology interprets marriage as the union of one man and one woman for the whole people of the land. But these are not sacred values that only apply to the State or Federal Government. What we have to make sure is that the benefits of marriage do not fall on the lowest common denominator.  Frankly, this bill, as it currently stands, is not about providing health care benefits to married couples. It is about making sure that an American man and a European woman who live in the same housing project get the same Medicare benefits as a domestic couple. And I do not know any other place in the world where this is possible. I have been to Italy. I have been to Russia. They are only interested in couples who stay together. This is a way to balance it out.  I think that we have

Mr. Speaker, I was recently asked who is right, the Southern Baptists or Disney, in their argument regarding homosexuality. The question was pointedly directed to the Washington Post in an article entitled ``Disney Says Child Pornography is Not a Moral Issue.'' I cannot read the headline on the Express but the newspaper has identified a pro-same-sex marriage letter signed by Disney CEO William I. Rol baptists on their ``Can't See It Not Now'' statement that attacks the conservative position in opposing same-sex marriage. This was a May 15 editorial that expresses the beliefs of the originators of the position of the founder of the Southern Baptist Convention. It does not have to be a statement that encourages homosexual behavior as does the other side of the story.  As the Southern Baptist Convention's leader stated on May 9, 1995: Every biblical perspective on this subject tells us that marriage is the ``institution of the covenant of grace and that its essential characteristics

rule make amendment

Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill; it therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The amendment would require the Attorney General to make a report to Congress regarding the administration of justice by race and ethnicity in all cases in which discrimination has been alleged to exist, including civil rights complaints. Under this provision, a grantee of Federal funding would have to apply to a Federal judge for a direction to conduct a hearing on the waiver of any preexisting standard or exception that does not violate any of the Federal civil rights laws. I do not think that this language is necessary in the context of this bill and would urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The  opaque Pentagon decision to move this week from the $300 million program to a $400 million defense conference was announced Friday afternoon last week by the Pentagon official in charge on Thursday. If confirmed, it would be the largest defense cut in the history of the Pentagon, cost increasing $82 million above the Pentagon's budget request.  This means that Americans may face a 6.4 percent cut in their paychecks from January 1996. There is concern that 1 million civilian positions could be threatened as a result.

We worked for some 6 months to set up a base that did not require the FCC to have a very high technology base, because this was the part of the military operation that did not have one. So this was a carefully thought out plan.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I must admit that, back home, the Green New Deal means that John Deere dealers in my district would have to compete for American construction jobs against similar jobs in other parts of the world where they can get free financing from the State of Florida. It increases the cost of everything from a boiler and power plant to a tractor and a car. These days we are told that this Green New Deal is good for the environment. But it is gentleman after gentleman in Florida who are just mad at government when they can actually make more money by taking $150 from their small business.  We have got to go home and tell them that, if we really believe in a goal that means more than political lectures from Wall Street special interest lobbyists, we have got to do what it takes to restore their power and their influence by voting on the Green New Deal and restoring fiscal responsibility and market competition in this

Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those calling for the approval of the motion to proceed that we will soon vote on before the Senate. This bill is a good one for a number of reasons. First of all, it funds the Department of Homeland Security more than expected.  I support the many programs that are related to homeland security. They need to be paid for. There is no dispute over that. We don't want to see sequestration or cuts in the funding for homeland security. I support those programs, but what we are trying to get at is making sure that, when we come back at the end of the fiscal year in fiscal year 2010, we can provide the same amount of funding for these programs as we were able to do for the programs in the House of Representatives.

Mr. President, I was very surprised and disappointed yesterday when I heard that President Clinton had vetoed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This bill was developed to provide private litigation firms with an opportunity to participate in the private sector process without the threat of Government interference, under certain guidelines, regulations, and standards.  Like all good ideas that come from thoughtful deliberation and compromise, the provision in the bill that the President vetoed was unnecessary and just plain bad policy.  The gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Wynn] and I were working on the bill with Senator Byrd and others on a bipartisan basis, to establish the basis of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act as a safeguard for thousands of cases. After deliberation we arrived at a compromise bill and drafted some good provisions which are intended to assure that private litigation firms will have the opportunity to participate in the private sector process and avoid Government interference.

The reason it is the least likely to kill the bill is that it is so closely tied to the so-called Iran-Iraq war in which the Obama administration wants to start the process of having this country moved to the east in Iraq.  We should be debating this bill. This is not a partisan issue. This is not a hot button issue. It is a serious issue that should be debated on the Senate floor.

While there has been some talk that we should actually expand oil production to protect the Clinton-era and Bush-era tax cuts from being cut by 21 percent this year, I am more concerned about us a bit being a little bit vulnerable if someone is very gentlemanly and decide to ramp up production, that is, to drill more wells for less money.  We need to see, if we want the companies to continue to get the $800-plus billion in tax cuts, if we want them to reinvest those dividends, if we want them to increase exploration into unconventional reserves, in the bill that was just passed.

To be sure, many in Congress, the White House, the State Department and the veterans community have been and are engaged in a vigorous dialog on the future of the VVMF. In the words of the Senator from Nebraska, Sargent Shriver, who has been a leader on this topic, ``a renewed commitment to this legacy of achievement is the only strategy we have for achieving real change in Vietnam.''  To Senator Shriver and the VVMF Foundation, these demands for change appear to have the makings of an excellent ``soft'' compromise. This rhetoric is shortsighted, however, because

One of the ways the government can get the most out of facial recognition is to use it in the ways the Government of the United States of America has used it in civilian purposes.  This amendment will protect the privacy of the American people. Facial recognition technology does not work in crowded public places such as hotels, restaurants, or the Super Bowl.

Mr. President, I am chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and I want to say a few words about China and a very courageous person by the name of Huang Jian zhisheng. He was the person who decided to bring what we called the law of human rights to China. That is the law that the Communist Party under Mao Zedong has placed on all Chinese citizens. So Huang Jian zhisheng had a very courageous goal to bring this law to China. He did that, and he brought about the most important and significant change that I think has occurred since the end of the last century in China, where people now have complete political freedom of speech.  Huang Jian zhisheng also did a wonderful job in establishing the concept of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which is the first group of nations in the world that have confronted Communist China.

Section 434 was signed into law on April 7, 1996 with my Senate colleagues joining in support of this legislation which passed the House of Representatives on May 10, 1996 and the President signed this legislation into law on April 24, 1996.  The subject of this legislation has been discussed in the Senate immigration subcommittee for quite some time, and as a result I feel it is imperative to bring the focus of this legislation back to the issue of Federal benefits to the 2.3 million illegal aliens, or the estimated 250,000 illegal aliens currently residing in the United States. In addition to being addressed in my bill, the amendment I am introducing today is the same amendment that was passed in the House on May 9, 1996 and which will be included in the Senate amendment on Wednesday.

Liberal Democrats can be reasonable and even decent. We cannot afford to lose the budget deficits they manage. Let me just give a one-page statement of how they manage deficits, budget deficits Medicaid under this budget, Medicare--don't worry, it's not entitlements, it's the deficit.  The other thing I would like to point out, though, is that these liberals want to do something that our Republican colleagues have been passing around here for years, and that is to create new job opportunities for these children who are born.

It has been asserted that the conference report requires the United States to use its prewar production capabilities to supply America with warheads for ballistic missiles that the United States will deliver to the enemy in the near future. However, the conference report does not require the United States to provide the National Intelligence Estimate to the Congress on the high-yield nuclear warhead system and only requires the President to submit a report to Congress on the adequacy of existing nuclear weapons stockpile.  The fact that the administration will not submit such an estimate to Congress may be of interest to some, but it is not for that very reason. According to the U.S. Army Field Manual and Congressional Practice Report on the National Defense Authorization Act of the United States, each time the President of the United States reviews, modifies, or makes changes to a national strategic plan, the

Madam Chair, this amendment would remove $150,000 of funding for the historic Fort Payne Coal and Iron Building rehabilitation and would lower the cost of this project to the local taxpayer. It is a necessary step to give the State of West Virginia the authority to assist in the control of the booming and explosive market for coal ash in its cities and towns.  For example, municipalities may not be able to handle a multitude of tons of coal ash that must be placed in the local storage facilities without government resources. This is going to solve that problem and help businesses in my community manage the waste safely.  The new House Republican budget has proposed eliminating funding for this project and restoring $150,000 to the maximum Federal appropriation and eliminating the PACE contract. This program is an excellent example of government run downs, and I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks in support of H.R. 621, I do want to suggest to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) and to the Members of this body that this is a bill that has very strong support from both sides of the aisle and Members on the other side of the aisle want to get it done and to give us a chance to vote. This is not an easy thing to do because I think that both sides of the aisle in Georgia feel it is very important.  We started this conversation last week when we had a meeting with the Speaker of the House and Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary that was made very clear that remarks were to be made and to be taken with a wide spirit of courtesy and understanding about the desire of the American people to have this measure voted on in a timely fashion. They have been to our offices, asked to speak, and we said ``no problem.'' We understand that if we

Indeed, I commend the committee as a whole for the excellent work they do to educate our young people about the importance of putting the people first in our decisions here in the United States Congress as well as the Congress of the United States in the world as a whole and the need to yield the appropriate amount of weight to the quality of the assessment of the impact of our actions in the course of this debate as well as the final legislation that will be adopted by the Congress and the Senate. I agree with him that this important program ought to be done in an ethical, nonpartisan manner that will encourage people to come to the debate and participate in a free and open society so that we can see firsthand the consequences of what we are doing in the United States Congress and the U.S. Senate.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The chairman of the committee has authorized this policy by statute in the Federal securities laws, and I am simply saying we ought to allow this kind of corporate misuse to take place, not just the corporate executives who do it. I think that some corporate executives do it every now and then, and we ought to do something about it. I do not believe we ought to audit corporations and audit executives accounting books every day.  We have not had this legislation before the House for a long time. It will affect corporations to the extent we do not. It will affect their costs and their income because what we are proposing is that they have to file their annual report, they have to pay their securities tax.

Mr. President, this amendment would unfairly rescind building and facilities money that was finally committed 2 years ago to the Environmental Simulation Facility at the Naval Air Weapons Station in Crystal City, IN. The project is a key element in the growing effort to reduce our nation's nuclear force and improve nuclear weapons planning in the President's budget for fiscal year 1995 and beyond. The move to this new complex is the result of years of hard work and the committee recommendation has finally been signed by the DOD as an environmental benefit.  There has been some question as to whether this project would be more costly than more of the existing nuclear complex in Crystal City. I can assure the committee that construction will not be more expensive than existing facilities and that it will provide an environmental benefit.  We all know about the great expense of nuclear weapons. I can also assure the committee that there are ways that this project could be made less expensive and have a greater environmental benefit

The Student Debt Reduction Act would allow for a loan forgiveness or downpayment to be made when a student files his or her tax return, subject to a 60-percent failure rate for any student who does not meet the Speaker's rule number. This agreement will help all of our students and our country, in fact all of us, and we thank Chairman Goodling for his hard work on this bill.  Specifically, this legislation will increase the maximum deduction for college tuition for an individual student from $2,000 to $6,000 annually. That is equivalent to a child's rate

Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio for their work on this. It has been a bipartisan effort. It has been supported in the past by this House and I look forward to continuing to work with them and this House on this issue and other issues related to science and innovation in our economy and our businesses and our communities. I urge support of the amendment.   Grapefruit is an important industry for the State of Arizona and other States that rely on it for our business, but they need that grower to have the type of support the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act provides for disadvantaged access to and risk assessments for their industry.  This is why it is so critically important that we provide funding for the GRAMS Program that currently supports this important service.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I would say that there has been a lot of talk lately about this administration not being serious about job creation and our economy and not being concerned about our deficit. And so when President Obama says we are doing something about the budget deficit, I don't think he is being serious about his own administration or his own mission in the Congress to actually help us do something about the deficit and help us make it go away because that was Colorado's bill that was signed into law last year. But I am the first one in this body to stand up and say: What the heck is wrong with our government when we have been such a successful government?  A new majority, Democrat and Republican, has put a bill together that is supposed to help us do something about the deficit, a budget deficit, an energy deficit, a trade deficit, a crime bill, a debt limit

Mr. Speaker, the Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 1994, which I am introducing today, is an important part of the campaign to reverse the rising rate of prostate cancer deaths in the United States and to increase the number of new prostate cancer cases being diagnosed annually in this country through the early and year-round screening and early detection of the disease.  The prostate is the primary site for 70 to 80 percent of the deaths of American men. Earlier this year, several Members of Congress joined me in introducing a bill to expand the use of ultrasounds in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that about 14,000 men die annually from prostate cancer. We must ensure that the screening and detection techniques are effective and cost effective, and the bill before us today will allow us to do that.  Mr. Speaker, the prostate is one of the most aggressive cancers in this country, and there is growing evidence that

Senator Sarbanes and I have worked closely together on a number of budget proposals since the passage of the Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1996. The savings from this amendment would begin to build up in the context of the 2007-2008 budget resolution.

The controversy usually begins over NEA grants to non-profit arts organizations or those with an ideological agenda that could be a threat to the free market. The year 2002 grants totaled over $15 million and the President authorized $12 million. The administration promised to make substantial improvements in the National Endowment for the Arts which Federal tax dollars should fund to the level recommended by Congress Committee on Education and Labor.  Last year I spent some time traveling around Colorado debating this issue with many other Senators, and received testimony from many other arts community leaders and local local leaders. I have witnessed a lot of great progress on the NEA as far as spending cuts and increases to cut the funding level. Even though we are at the halfway point of this year, Congress has already eliminated NEA funding. It is high time to terminate funding and get back

I know what this is like as a veteran and an older person who has more of a direct connection to the workplace and has to deal with our limitations as to how we should apply the work requirement and to clean up some of the waste in our districts that are quite extensive.  This proposal, as some have said earlier, is a compromise between the different proposals that have been presented to the White House scheme. I think the President of the United States would accept the compromise proposals.  I understand that there are five of us--Senators Kerry, Dole, Dodd, Breaux, and Dodd-Webb--that have put our name on this legislation, and I think the committee would welcome this, too.

But the problem we have right now is this piece of legislation that we are going to take up today will not do anything to make our country more secure except to make it more political. We want to sit down and try to work together, but at the end of the day we are going to have another vote today.

I think we have a fantastic opportunity. Here is another book that was prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, something that we should read every single day for the rest of the country and people that I think are very interested in what we do here in Washington and how we take away their opportunity to make an informed decision on what we should do with their taxes in this country.  It talks about the impact of our tax cuts in the year 2000 on reducing the growth of the national debt, our national debt as a percentage of our GDP. It has 439 pages of information. And one of the things that is very important is that it is not just a number or a figure, it is a vision of what the future might be if we took the kinds of steps that we have discussed today.  We can and we must take a look at it and then make a policy decision.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

effects vaccination program 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I had hoped to come to the Floor today with a bill I could recommend to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. What I saw was the failure of the Administration to take the initiative to reform the program. So, instead of going on and analyzing what is working and what is not working and where the problem is coming from and how we can fix it and where it can be made better, I will simply suggest what the effect will be on future generations.  The legislation before us today does not abolish funding for the program. The funding for the program will continue to go through every year unless this program changes. There will be no vaccination because it is another program under the old national ban on any procedure except for medical necessity.  Mr. Speaker, what the American people need to understand is that we must change, and not change the program to address the current problems or lack of reform. To do otherwise

Mr. President, I wanted to quickly review the historic 1st session of the 104th Congress, the first Republican Congress in 40 years. On January 3, 1995, the 104th Congress adjourned and the new Congress began its first legislative session. The work of the new Congress could not have been more important to America. As the House of Representatives comes into session for the first time since the historic Clinton National Conference in 1993, the American people have been focused on finding a way to restore the values that set our Nation apart.  First and foremost, the American people wanted to see fiscal responsibility in Washington. Congress should not be a place where big spending or special interest special deals mar the good work of Federal agencies. Under the leadership of Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Republican leader Tom Foley, this Congress has been a positive and progressive force for the last two decades. As a new Republican majority gets underway, it will have a clear and compelling agenda

He said we did not try to write laws that went so far as to require labeling. He also said this amendment that the Senate is considering is going to be different. The House-passed version of this bill does not give the American people any choice about whether or not they are going to have a great white shark swimming in the Pacific Ocean, a blue shark swimming in the Southern Ocean, or a pufferfish in the Gulf of Mexico, or whether they are going to have the best current that is going to put squarely in our minds the product they are purchasing at the store and saying, ``Look, this is an endangered species that is a real threat to us.''

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Sensenbrenner amendment. The underlying bill, as we know, exempts transactions with a business licensed or authorized by this country from the financial services laws of this country. My concern is that foreign investment in U.S. businesses is limited to the tribal government of tribes in this country, and there is no Federal charter for the corporation. Chairman Sensenbrenner has provided an exemption for these kinds of transactions by amending the Native American Gaming Regulatory Act.  My amendment would simply simply make the carve out that he has provided for this non-Federal entity part of the tribal government. There are a lot of assumptions that we have about how we want to treat our tribes, so I just wanted to bring to the attention of the committee, since it seems so strange that our very first step is to require this.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

state legislation act 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, S. 1963, the Interstate Banking and Branching Act of 1994, is important legislation. The reason, however, that the legislation has such widespread support is because it gives States greater flexibility in their interstate banking statutes and in their interstate branching statutes. As the legislation would also affect States that already have laws such as the State Flag Act of 1890 in effect, this is a beneficial, rather than necessarily objectionable, provision.  There are two reasons to support this legislation. First, S. 1963 will finally get the Federal Government off the hook for States that would not have otherwise created a permitting regime or that did not have a meaningful statutory permitting regime and that violated the product liability laws of the United States.  Second, this legislation will permit States to enforce those laws that have been intentionally written so that only those laws, if adequately enforced, would not be allowed by the Federal Government.  The way in which States are affected by S. 1963 is to

Indeed, the President set his own agenda in terms of what we would expect the Federal Government to do when it comes to social policy and welfare.  We need to establish a robust, independent regulatory environment where you are free to craft solutions based on actual science, legislative analysis, and, most importantly, reasonable cost-benefit analysis.

Our Nation is at war with the world's most corrupt regime, and the administration wants to cut by $15 billion the vital anti-money laundering, anti-money laundering technology in a threat to our Nation's financial system and to our national security.

Mr. Speaker, for those Members who are going home and having town hall meetings and meeting with constituents, the one issue that comes up with great frequency is the issue of low-income housing. And that is the issue of new construction in America and how that has been increased in States such as Ohio and Washington State and other States around the United States, and that there are people who have been forced to use the older of two jobs and are being pushed up the job ladder or have been denied the assistance that they need in their working families who are Members of Congress.  That is a serious issue that we need to be talking about in terms of the issue of equity and equity in terms of housing.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

finance healthy committee 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP. Pending is a substitute amendment to the Senate Finance Committee substitute that was adopted yesterday. That substitute includes a specific provision that gives States a strong incentive to expand health care coverage for low-income children under their Healthy Start programs. The Senate Finance Committee substitute is designed to leverage the incentives in the bill to keep uninsured children from falling through the cracks. Without that, not enough children will get the health care coverage they need.  While this program is the best hope for millions of uninsured children across our country, it is completely inadequate to meet the nutritional needs of the uninsured. The bill that we voted on yesterday includes a 60-percent cut in SCHIP, which would fall disproportionately on low-income and minority children. A 50 percent cut would cut enough from SCHIP to meet 50 percent of the nutritional needs of the uninsured, regardless

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, the decision to ban snowmobiles from the roads of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks is based on politics, not on facts and science. According to the National Park Service and the Congressional Budget Office, these roads must meet some 5 or 10 key environmental criteria to be appropriate for snow bison hunting and shooting for the purposes of sports and historical values and recreation in the park. But Congress has chosen not to ban this historic natural part of the United States of America on this Congress and not to debate why it is that Congress chose not to ban the Clinton family shooting horses, again, the leader of the Clinton campaign, while they were allowed to visit our public lands without any input from the American public.  These national parks, including Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Big Sky National Parks, are truly grand, pristine and unique. Yet, the original decision to deny snowmobile hunting access was based on politics rather than the facts.

In the early 1970's, the Congress appropriated the Agricultural Adjustment and Conservation Program as part of the farm bill to help produce both new and returning farmers.

The aftermath of the last three days of the invasion and the report of Turkish troop maneuvers and strikes further demonstrates that the Turkish invasion of Cyprus was authorized and under direction of the United States Government.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The atrocities of the last decades will not cease with the introduction of military forces. Rwanda and Bosnia are nations where ethnic groups are exchanged among a handful of ethnically distinct groups in part for political advantage. Haiti will have to be linked, the Hutus and Tutsis, to this intercommunal slaughter in order to succeed.

Mr. President, under the Taxpayer's Relief Act of 1997, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association [TIAA] and the College Retirement Equities Fund [CREF] are taxed as business assets. This tax relief is necessary to meet the retirement needs of our teachers who work for State and local governments and who plan for retirement and will not be able to earn additional income to meet other needs of their families and communities without it. I thank President Clinton for giving us a tax relief to help move this work force toward their long-term health and future happiness.  The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association is a limited liability company that is called the Teachers Insurance Fund [TIFI]. It is one of two public-private entities working together on a statewide basis to develop and administer the Teachers Insurance Act. Each State receives its share of the scholarship, annuity, and coverage contribution for the purpose of receiving TIFI's tax benefits. Through the work of TIFI and

I was at that State of the Union and would have voted for that bill.  Idaho is one of the States that is in trouble right now. The State is in very serious financial straits. We, of course, believe that the States should act in their own best interests in making decisions about how to do the things that best fit the interests of those who live in those States, whether that be an unemployment insurance program or whether it is even a transportation safety net program for people who find themselves in situations where they are unemployed.

The amendment does track the government's commitment to provide assistance to such institutions as can best be used for that purpose as well as those which have a higher standard for success such as the public and private sector should have when they are looking at such issues of providing a similar kind of services as the military so that the support they are able to provide can be as good as it can be so that more often than not we can be sure that we are indeed ensuring that these are indeed appropriate and appropriate manner in which that type of individual is provided the services that he or she, perhaps, perhaps, has in any situation at all.

The reason is simply that because of the time advantage--if a voice vote is entered, there is no opportunity to check that against a point of order.  The time advantage is a great advantage. It lets the Senator from California know how much time they have and as much time it takes to get there.  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the bill and urge my colleagues to vote no.

Let me be very clear in my opposition to the amendment. The gentleman from California [Mr. Condit] is talking about the right to trial. Let us think about that.

Some in the war on terror have claimed that the military forces deployed in Iraq would have troops in Baghdad by January 7, but the statistics show that the Iraqi Government is more than likely to begin a civilian general election to take place in the first week in January. In Minnesota, the first day of the holiday holiday week in May has traditionally been a particularly busy day for the United States military because the holiday week coincides with General Motors' summer sales season.

close nazi violence 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, as the daughter of a refugee from Nazi Germany, issues of anti-Semitism and the continuing terrorist violence against Israel are close to my heart and my mind. While some Members of this body have been silent and even critical of the violence that has been going on against Israel in recent years, I must call out one of the most infamous leaders in the far-left of the Democratic Party in the close-to-Nazi era.  The Nazi Party originally called for the extermination of all Jews. Yet today it continues to flourish in the Democratic Party. One could be forgiven for thinking that a party which once focused its attention on recognizing Jews as a separate and distinct people was done in by the half of its leadership who are part of the left, who are it seems would not, after all, join a party that had absolutely no anti-Semitism, would not reject a party which had led the way in terms of successfully fighting illegal immigrants

Mr. Speaker, thirty-seven years ago this week, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Roe v. Wade, making abortion legal in the United States. The vote was 56 to 44 that day. I was the only woman in the last years of the two-term Congress to vote for it and the last women to have voted for the most recent one as a Member of the Congress in the last decade or so on this issue on this week in this Congress for about 30 years after that decision was made by this country's most significant history since the Fourteenth Amendment in the last decade or so ago.  It was a record vote by the Supreme Court. Forty-seven percent of the people in this country, even many of the more moderate--maybe the liberal or maybe some of the more conservative--hard-right people voted for it. Thirty-seven years, for which I am grateful. It gave Americans the chance to be heard, including me and

For over a quarter of a century, we have allowed our draw down of natural resources to eat up more and more scarce water supplies and consume more and more scarce land that could be an integral part of our critical public health infrastructure and environment.  The American people have a good sense of what that situation means and have seen it at every step as they have voted.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 79, the Flag Protection Act. The purpose of this amendment is simple: To empower States and local governments to protect our flag and to prevent the desecration of our flag by anyone who would do so.  One of the most significant problems States and local governments have in dealing with these issues is that of law enforcement and particularly the threat of violence and intimidation that can result if their efforts are not well coordinated and strong. Our flag is symbolic of our Constitution, our national values, our national character, our Nation's freedom. It is a symbol of democracy.  We are not supposed to dishonor our flag because those who disfigure it for political purposes are committing a terrible crime against our country, and we should be proud of it. So the well-meaning amendments offered to H.R. 79 will provide States and local governments the ability to make it a Federal crime to desec

I do not think we ought to exempt the program, but what is good about the program is what it will accomplish and the decisions that it will make.

Today we are spending $6.7 billion on the same project.  The heart of the Postal Service's request was $15 billion for new mail buildings and, lo and behold, today it is up to $28 billion. We are talking about almost $300 million more for services that were in the process of being eliminated in this last year. Why would we look at this, when we are facing a 5.7 percent surpluses?

Under the present interpretation of the term, that requirement cannot be met.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the debates have been made. I remember the comment by my colleague from Connecticut during the Whitewater hearings when he said everything that was done was done with political pressure. That is what happened with President Clinton as well. There were a lot of people with political pressure for the President to do this. The State of Connecticut was one of them. And I think they did some of the things that they should have done.  Senator Dodd on the other hand was a Democrat Senator and the people of Connecticut were representatives of the people of the United States. The concerns he expressed in the legislation that was sent up, about passing a meaningful check on health care costs, were things that, I think, were smart. The reason they are smart is because they felt that if we said to the insurance companies, when you are making these decisions as to the health of the American people, you have got to have competition.

The mission of the John R. Elliott HERO Campaign is to promote the safety and security of those who enter our Nation's highways. The campaign provides low- and middle-income southern New Hampshire seniors with an opportunity to choose a private driver and provide them the peace of mind that comes with knowing that their own resources will be available if they need to get home safely.  The campaign has provided more than 5,300 New Hampshire seniors with customized driver training classes to prepare them to secure the right vehicle and to assist them in meeting the unexpected needs of the road.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the Solomon amendment. Mr. Chairman, in my analysis, this is the most complete and absolutely devastating attack on rural America I think that has ever been done in this farm bill. I think that if we are going to consider this legislation we absolutely have to eliminate as a point of order the Solomon amendment. The Federal district court system is the one thing that guarantees that rural America, as well as New York, will be protected. This amendment will kill a number of vital programs which are at the heart of the rural development account. I do not know if the chairman is aware of the fact that farm legislation has been in my hand for a long time; it is from 1992. It is an emergency legislation. It is a short-term measure to do what the Congressional Budget Office said was necessary to balance the budget, to come to an agreement, what will be the final numbers, before a year's end.

While I realize this bill is a product of intense and real-world experience and must be improved upon, many of us still see it as a necessary first step. But let us take a step back for a second and look at what it really is. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act is fundamentally flawed because it is based on a false premise that creating jobs by manufacturing jobs is the answer to economic woes such as the national debt and the global financial industry's problems.  America's economic recovery is far too complex and far too complex, and the creation of jobs--job creation in the manufacturing sector, job creation in the private sector, job creation in the real estate sector and in so many other ways--impairs economic growth because it does not allow the private sector to keep growing jobs by creating demand for them. Job creation under the current circumstance results

The constituents of these businesses, the citizens of this country, benefit most from the industry's success because the taxpayers in this country provide the subsidy, because the taxpayers pay taxes in terms of paying the wealthiest people in America.  Now, let's be very clear. The advantage that the manufacturers of this industry have is because of Federal support. The product is made and produced in this country. The cost of production is subsidized by taxpayers in this country.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, last week, this Nation suffered a great loss. And because of that loss, those who favor freedom and believe in individual rights and freedom of conscience are called to think about the consequences of justice for the families who lost loved ones to gun violence in this country. They would call that a loss of justice for those who care for those whose mothers and fathers and children died of welfare and hope that we would have a way of rectifying that and making that correction with the result of fewer lives lost and more lives saved versus the President's proposal.  Mr. Speaker, that is what is at issue here today.  Two days ago, I had an opportunity to come to New Jersey and speak in honor of Paul Michael. He was my nephew and I have the honor of serving in this body with him. When I was a lawyer, I was a trial lawyer, I went to court. My colleagues could not believe what happened when

That would be my expectation and I would hope it would be the same expectation that would be put forward by the other side if we cut this whole thing completely.

So it is not that the government is saying small businesses should not have any say in this as to what kind of plan they buy but it is note that we do not need to worry as much as some people are saying about their coverage, because the government will not be able to tell them what kind of plan they should have because they will not be able to tell the government, ``We will make it just as expensive as you made it for your premiums on your insurance policies and we will pay you a premium.''

When he was first nominated, Judge Fields announced he would move swiftly to consider the nomination of this respected individual to the Federal bench.

In its first year of existence, the program has done more than help America's workers in their last days of the work force than it has ever done before because it has expanded its Nation's ability to make sure it has a strong trade enforcement system and a strong domestic market.  I can remember the fear that America had just a couple of years ago that other countries, including Canada, Mexico, and other other parts of the world would enter into a world trade agreement with this nation, this GATT agreement.

proposal taxes middle 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against the Republican tax proposal to raise taxes on the middle class. Moreover, congressional Republicans claim to be pro-life, yet their tax proposal would impose a 25-percent tax on middle-class taxpayers. This would deny millions of families in America an opportunity to protect their children and extend tax relief to them. These tax increases would push middle-class families into poverty and into poverty-level households.  Mr. Speaker, in all of its history, our Founding Fathers put forth a clear priority for tax relief: The middle class should not and should not be forced into poverty by politicians in Washington, D.C.  Last year, Democrats tried to increase taxes on the middle class by passing the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act of 2009. The bill that passed the House failed. The bill would have taxed doctors who provide health care in private practices and decreased the Medical Research Quality Fund. On April 15, the

Our Nation is blessed to have the proud leadership of the National Auctioneers Association. Our country's leading trade association for sports and entertainment, this association has consistently proven its integrity through a daily commitment to honor the values of the millions of Americans who attend auctions every year.  Through the many many opportunities I have had as an auctioneer, I have seen firsthand the great qualities that the marketplace provides us as a Nation.

amendment constitution constitutional 

Final sequence: 

Well, let me put it this way. I don't have to ask that question. I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia would. But I cannot support this amendment without the threat of not addressing another constitutional issue that is in here. That is the question of campaign finance reform.  The question of campaign finance reform requires constitutional interpretation. And to say we have no problem with that, that a citizen of the United States is not a political campaign and that someone who runs for President of the United States and that person is a registered lobbyist in a political campaign, that becomes an attack on the freedom of expression of the citizenry.  The best safeguard against such an abuse of the freedom of expression is to insure the integrity of our elections. To support the Richardson amendment is an attack on that.  This Senator has been fighting for campaign finance reform for 25 years. In 1994 he authored the American Political Reform Act. He fought for it. I

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I thank Senator Exon for his courtesies. This has been a very difficult budget resolution, in the sense that we have considered, overall, many things in this budget that I think are very important for the country, as we considered various tax cuts and tax policy reforms and important appropriations for important things like the FBI and the Department of State. As we had the Senate debate this bill on the Republican side a week ago, it looked as if we would do this budget resolution next week, and there is a good reason for that. The matter is the resolution does not require binding budget cuts--specifically, $1.2 billion, which is why we did not need to have a debate on the Republican side about what the amendments are about to cut. We thought that we could leave that to the Finance Committee.  We do not think it is, and the second option is a separate, separate reconciliation proposal which I believe the Finance Committee

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with my colleagues in remembering the victims of the Armenian genocide. Perhaps the only lesson we can draw from the Armenian crisis is that human rights abuses must never be tolerated in a democratic republic like the United States of America.  In the words of Ambassador Cunningham to the Committee on Foreign Relations, my colleagues, all human rights are the property of the peoples of the world, and they must be protected. The Russians understand this as well as the Turks, the French and all other Western nations. On the 25th anniversary of the massacre, it is important to remember the following facts. The Armenian genocide was a deliberate genocide carried out by the Turkish Government with the aid and succor of the United States Government. The Turkish Government and their citizens carried out the acts of cruelty against the Armenian people and intentionally intentionally mistreated the Jewish people.  More importantly, the Armenian genocide was perpetrated by a government and its

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule. By adopting this resolution, we have taken a strong first step today in the long process of establishing a framework for the future of the Palestinian people. We have established a well-defined path for the return of the children to their families and for the peace process to continue as hoped for in the days ahead. It will take time to establish and make a lasting relationship between the people and their Government and it will take time to spend the money that will be necessary for peace. But we have built a framework that helps us to prepare for the most likely consequences of failure. And the prospect that the world will fail to act is much more severe than it is today. We must make it clear, as the United States clearly has done, that America's policy towards Israel is not a blank check, not an end run around the world

Madam President, I listened carefully to the statement made by the Republican leader. I noticed that for the last few days the Republicans have been saying that we should make no new cuts to domestic programs other than those the Democrats have requested in the bill that we are passing today. The leader said this earlier today when he was asked about how the cuts he has proposed would affect children and families. He said that he thinks that children will not be hurt as much as he has proposed, that families will not be hurt as much as he has proposed because it has been shown that ObamaCare will not affect them. So we should not cut Medicaid.  But, Madam President, now I am struck by this statement by the Republican leader. I was listening to the whole thing yesterday. I came down to the floor when he was speaking and I asked him: I guess the other question he would have to answer is what was the rationale for coming

This legislation would end what has become one of the most insidious parts of our system of campaign finance law. Under current law, all public money is permitted to be spent in a Federal election even if it was not previously intended to be spent in such an election. This is a well-accepted and widely accepted practice and one which all Americans live with today. It is the most basic of our constitutional freedoms and simply one of the core values we hold dear.  However, the Federal Government was never designed to spend money for campaigns. In fact, the Founders of our Constitution clearly intended a more limited role for the Federal Government in the political process. In my view, Federal agencies are not permitted to spend the public's money to advertise political candidates. And when they do, it

Mr. President, I am certain that we will have some arguments in opposition to the amendment for doing the formula differently than Senator Bumpers has done for purposes of looking at them separately, because what Senator Bumpers has done is only looking at the top 10 States with the most welfare recipients in one State and only those States that were dealing with large numbers of children with children that the Secretary has determined are needy for the most money, and that is doing so through the testing. So for that reason, I am sure it is going to be accepted.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I think most Americans would say that they would like to see a broad and wide-ranging Medicare reform bill in this House, and, if it passed, in the Senate.

We did have some disagreements in the last Congress when the legislation was under consideration and it was not brought up and brought up for a vote on the floor because some of the systems were deemed by the attorneys general, the Governmental Affairs Committee, not to be effective. But it is a much more comprehensive bill than was the last time it was put together and the reason I compliment the Senator from Nebraska and the others who are still part of the committee.

I stand here today to say that I will vote in support of the California budget resolution because the bipartisan plan is good for children.  My home district of Los Angeles County has been particularly hard hit by the State Department of Education's irrational reduction in local education funds, $21 million cut in fiscal year 1995 from fiscal year 1994. This cut, coupled with funding cuts recommended by Governor Wilson in his State education budgets for school districts, will result in the loss of more than 3,000 jobs at Los Angeles public schools. This represents a cut of almost $8 million per year per child, a 22 percent reduction from the fiscal year 1995 level. I would like to talk about some of the thousands of families and schools who will lose because of these cuts.  Under this

national withholding coalition 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky for his leadership in working to bring more congressional oversight to the regulatory process. The concerns that the gentleman raises on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are the same issues that I believe the national intelligence committees, the Congress of the United States, and the Government Accountability Office are having on this issue as well. It should be bipartisan to move this legislation forward so that the Government Accountability Office is in control of the information that is withheld or withheld withholding or that is not available and is not available to the Members of Congress in the way the law requires that the Government Accountability Office be in control of the information that is in the government coalition. It is the same issue, as he has pointed out, that I would also bring to the public attention on the Oversight Committee and other oversight committees as well. I think the transparency that would be there would be great.  I also have a concern

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. While I agree with some of what my colleague from Wisconsin just spoke about, there is no question that this gentleman and his family are not exempt from the Americans With Disabilities Act and their families and employees are not simply ``un mexicans'' as the gentleman from Washington just spoke about the members of the Border Patrol are.  The bill that the gentleman from Wisconsin speaks of, the REAL ID Act, was based on the Boren-DeFazio proposal in my opinion. It will allow at least 60 percent of people with a passport to travel, almost all of them will travel under the REAL ID Act, and it is a balanced bill. It will also ensure that we make sure that our border control officers are able to recognize that there is no one at that fence that says that this person is in our country, and that they are, therefore, in fact, Americans

Mr. President, I wish to compliment the Senator from Texas for sounding this warning. Being from Texas, she is undoubtedly aware of a great country-western song we use to describe a condition that apparently was out of this country long before the Civil War. It is ``The War to End All Wars.''  When the people in the other side of the aisle hear the warning that the chairman of the Budget Committee spoke of when he was at the White House earlier this week, it should be before the screening at Treasury and Internal Revenue. And so with that, I yield to my colleague, Senator Chafee.

department introducing technology 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to establish a National Environmental Technology Achievement Award. The annual award would be presented jointly by the EPA and the Department of Commerce, which would encourage technology transfer between the Federal Government and other American companies and educational institutions. Additionally, it would include a provision allowing a limited number of companies and institutions to compete for the award in which the companies or institutions would be recognized for new innovative ways of addressing various environmental challenges rather than creating new new regulations introducing new risks for the environment.  The Nation's environmental technology is the backbone of our economy, creating jobs and enhancing our quality of life. It is essential that we maintain and strengthen the ability of American companies and universities to compete in the global marketplace. But it is also essential that we provide resources to American companies and universities to enhance and expand their environmental credentials.  This year, innovation and entrepreneurship are leading sectors in the U.S. economy, and our legislation

Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is an actual photograph of actual water coming from an actual mountaintop removal coal mine. It is from the Mojave Desert area in California. This is water that was washed out by mountaintop removal coal in 2003. In 2003, the so-called Obama administration was in charge of the war on coal and the policy of the Obama administration was to keep the program going at the expense of the chairperson of the Department of the Interior, the Secretary of the Interior, at that time, Colin Powell. He appointed the office of administrator of the United States to oversee the Federal actions related to recovery of the last of those cases involving deaths related deaths related deaths related deaths related deaths related deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths deaths hospitalizations

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, this week, the Senate is having yet another debate on legislation to restrict healthcare for women, and I am going to take just a few minutes of the Senator's time to highlight what we are doing in the Senate to take away women's rights and law and order. As is often the case, it was President Obama who was the great and good parent for these issues.  My Republican colleagues have much less common sense than we do. They just do not seem to understand what political ideology is all about and the proper role of the government. They seem to have a strange fixation with partisan causes that come from the right wing of the Democrat Party. As Senator McConnell said, the bigger difference is the potential this proposal--and the bill we will vote on today--has to affect their extreme agenda to take away healthcare from millions of Americans. It is unfortunate, and it is sad, but this Democratic philosophy is so extreme, and

Mr. President, I have said many times that to say that food safety in this country is a patchwork is giving it too much credit. It is because of what the Food Safety and Inspection Service has been able to do over the years to get this job done more effectively than anybody in the Government in this country can in any other part of the Government because they have a very good staff and they are working with the public in a very effective way and giving every sort of information that they can to the public so that they can make their own decisions about whether this is good for the public and what is good for the public and what the times are.  I just want to note that it is impossible to give too much credit to the Inspection Service without saying, not only because they have done a great job but they have done an even better job than anybody in the Government in this country. They work very hard with people who are under investigation

Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic the picture that is painted by the now minority leader of the other side of the aisle when it comes to the needs of the men and women in this country during the time of this war in Iraq. The reason why this is so important for this resolution is because it shows that we can work together to make this process better than it was a year ago because you have to understand that the people who are arguing in favor of this resolution have not asked for anything. They are saying that the people who were wounded in this war, those of us who are on both sides of the aisle who have come to this country and saw the compassion of people, have asked for nothing. The gentleman from Louisiana, my friend, the gentleman from Washington, had a very interesting response to that, and he was right, when he said that the people who were wounded
