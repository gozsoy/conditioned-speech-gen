Mr. Speaker, today I rise to discuss the crucial and fundamental needs of health care in the 21st century. One of the largest shortages confronting the American people today, long overdue, is health care.  Much of our Nation's broken health care system stems from a failure to institute meaningful patient choice and competition in health care. It has also increased the cost of quality care for many seniors and severely hampered access for others. Millions more have become uninsured because they simply do not have enough money to afford to purchase health insurance.  Despite these problems, no one can argue with the fact that America is the richest and freest Nation on Earth. We produce

That is when we should have a military coup d'etat against the duly elected President of the United States, when all of the above are occurring.  You can count on me to do everything in my power to stop this next military coup. I will, in fact, work with you and other Members of Congress to stop this and prevent any such happening in the future.

First, it provides new authorities for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to make new regulations that prohibit pay discrimination and make it illegal for employers to pay women and other women under the age of 40 less than men for the same job performance.  The Equal Pay Act was passed in 1938 and was the first piece of civil rights legislation that Congress passed in many years. The fact is that since then pay discrimination has cost women an average of 27 percent of their all-time high earning years in a

My vote for the President and for President Bush will determine whether this conference is an appropriate time for that consideration.  It should

Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments of the Senate's time to engage in a colloquy with Senator Boxer regarding the most fundamental question of any child: Do we want a child born today to be eligible for health care or do we want to leave children without health care? I am strongly opposed to the legislation before us today because of the Senate majority leader's proposal to block the passage of this legislation through a procedural vote of the Senate. This proposal would ensure that no child in America is taken care of under the provisions of this legislation. The legislation we are considering today is the result of bipartisan consensus--it does not guarantee that

I have worked closely with the State legislature to ensure that new programs for children in low-income schools continue to meet the needs of children with special needs. A primary goal of these programs is to allow children to learn in a more family-oriented setting while providing them with access to appropriate and nutritious food and to learning opportunities.  The Children's Food Incentive Program [CFIP] was enacted in the late 1990's with the intent of allowing children in New Hampshire to use their parents' food stamp benefits to

That is the slowest rate of growth in our Nation's debt since the Great Depression. In only three years, the American people have seen their Federal debt increase from a very moderate level

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation because it provides needed funding to process the admission of Iraqi refugees who have been in America for more than 2 years or their families since the end of the Gulf war.  It is a victory for both nations and for America in the war on terrorism and also in the effort to restore America to its leadership in the world. These and other recent United States and Iraqi humanitarian organizations have provided support and assistance to a number of those individuals who would otherwise not be able to enter the United States because of their citizenship or the participation in the Iraqi military. For this reason, I would like to commend Chairman Foley

It is also not a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002.

We all know that the Affordable Care Act is going to be controversial this year and next year and the years to come and that it is going to face a real challenge from the Democratic leadership of this House to make it work. But there is one person on the other side of the aisle who says that this bill is not the right way to move forward, not to extend the life of the law or to prevent future bankruptcies. And that person is the leader of the Democratic

Mr. President, this amendment requires the United States to extend the toll-free telephone number of the Caribbean United States Trustee Program. The USTR has approved the Caribbean United States Trustee Program in the past on an annual basis. The amendment limits the Secretary of State's approval of the Caribbean United States Trustee Program only to any approval of an application submitted to the USTR within 90 days after the Secretary of State issues the first waiver of congressional approval on this program. The amendment does not reduce the total amount of appropriations authorized for the Caribbean United States Trustee Program.

Mr. President, as part of our effort to improve our aviation security, the Senate passed legislation earlier this year that provided for a $60 million increase in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration. It is important that we take a step forward in securing our aviation system by improving the funding for the Federal Aviation Administration. In bipartisan legislation that passed the House by an overwhelming margin, I and many of my colleagues sought to ensure that this funding for aviation safety remain at its current level of $90 billion and also to increase the FAA budget to the $600 billion President Bush's request.  In addition to additional funding for aviation safety, the FAA has made significant progress

Most particularly, I have been supportive of the concept of a sliding scale of benefits based on the State's need. The fact is that the current Federal benefit system is unfair and has produced massive benefits that cannot be justified on the basis of need and proven need alone. In many cases these benefits fall below those needed by the entire worker but in the case of the most severely disabled individuals it falls well above that need.

We need to help the next generation and be the American people that we are. We have an opportunity to bring the future back to this country where everyone is made in America by their success

The policy change will eliminate this artificial barrier to health care for our Nation's most vulnerable population. I would like to emphasize that this legislation does not add a new provision to any health reform bill or any other health care program. Instead it merely modifies current practices that were established in prior decades and will have real implications for the health care of many of our most vulnerable people. The current policy is a clear example of the kind of practice we have seen in our health care

(AP) The States of Minnesota and Mississippi are cutting taxes for small businesses to help the struggling Nation's lowest wage earners pay for their health care needs. They say they are taking a real stand in the face of the ``Freedom Caucus'' who wish to put more tax cuts for the very wealthy ahead of helping middle-income Americans.  The agreement is going to help go around a little one of the Freedom Caucus' biggest arguments, that tax cuts for big corporations are not the answer. The people at the low end of the income scale will really benefit if this legislation passes. Tax cuts for individuals are

My concern is that if we continue to let the market drive this process and give this bill a life, we will slow the rate of change in our forests. I think it is a big mistake to continue to push for changes in forest policy until there are some changes in the marketplace.

The budget deficit yesterday was $8.46 billion, which was an increase of $423 million over the previous year. But that doesn't tell the full story. We don't

It is not necessary to read the resolution on its face to understand its purpose, but to get a handle on it and its relevance to the current state of readiness and funding for the Pentagon would serve only to give a bad impression of the Congress' efforts to give our Armed Forces the equipment they need to ensure that they will have the equipment they need

While the amendment before us would increase the amount of dollars spent for safe food inspections, I do believe the safety concerns should be addressed more broadly through better management controls on contamination, inspection and transport of hazardous materials, as well as reasonable limits on the number of inspections per establishment.

The fact that more than one in three of the citizens in Maryland was not able to vote in 1960 because of a military service or other military training requirement left the State's citizens at a grave disadvantage.

Mr. Chairman, I want to point out to the House that the Department of Defense had reported $1,854 million for reconstruction of the damaged facilities in Iraq. These funds were fully appropriated by the Congress for fiscal year 2006, and in the year before this Congress appropriated $8,550,000.  As a matter of fact, during this same period the Department of Defense had to lay off thousands of Federal employees and was forced to make huge budget cuts that were not supported by the American people, but which they accepted in order to fund this as a priority in the budget.  The amendment offered by the gentleman from California will not only restore

My constituent, Pam, recently wrote to me in an e-mail. She writes, ``I am a 22-year-old single mom with kids and a lot of school work to do.
