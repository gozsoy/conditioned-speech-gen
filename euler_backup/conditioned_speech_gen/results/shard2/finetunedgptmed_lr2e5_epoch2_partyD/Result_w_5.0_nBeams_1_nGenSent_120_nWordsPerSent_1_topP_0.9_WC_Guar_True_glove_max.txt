leader bill today 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague Senator John McCain in introducing legislation that will help cut unnecessary Government spending. The bill I am introducing will help us close the Federal Government's budget deficit and help to create a more secure America.  As leader of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have been a strong advocate of the government spending reduction legislation that was signed into law last year. For too long, we have been forced to borrow far too much from China and other foreign countries to keep our Government open and businesses and families going. This is unacceptable and it is costing the American people more.

Mr. Chief Justice, this is very important legislation, and it is related to the Senate bill in several ways. I will spend the time just to give the background and history of the Democratic legislation in the House, the previous one here with the impact on the Fourth Circuit that the fourth circuit reached, and why I will be very much inclined to join with the Chief Justice to support the matter before the Senate.  The matter before the Senate is based upon the House bill that I introduced in January 1994 as the Juvenile Court Reform Act, the Jefferson amendment to the Juvenile Court Reorganization Act of 1994, which

Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support of the Chairman's amendment and my vote for the Head Start program and the promotion of Early Childhood Education and the Public School Legal Services Program and title I in the bill. These are the very programs that have been printed into the Congressional Record of the National Governors Association that are part of the reason that the bill passed the House without proceedings by the other body or the President.  The bill moves us toward real investments in school reform and the promotion of early childhood education and the public schools. Unfortunately, the conference report on the bill before us contains some proposals which will place

Final sequence: 

<|endoftext|>Make no mistake about it, to attack the women who work on the ground in the most hazardous and dangerous way possible is to take away one of their most basic rights as American citizens. The coverage they have now is too often not even considered because it is not widely recognized by the larger healthcare workforce.  The latest terrorist attack in Pennsylvania highlights that there are worse places to find a job than in the Federal, State and local level. Again, this attack was confirmed by local officials.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This bill closes the controversial ``MMS loophole'' in telecommunications law that allows free domestic telephony to be transferred overseas for conversion to a foreign language without adequate compensation.

Mr. President, I have been speaking here on the floor for nearly 30 days this year and I have never seen the American people so disappointed in their own Government as I have been seeing this week.  To say Congress has done some pretty important legislation and amendments are well-intentioned is an understatement. I have to say, as we consider this budget and other resources being cut in this budget, I worry very deeply about what a waste of time and money it will be to make deep cuts, to come up with other numbers and formulas.  We know they need a CR to make sure we have the time

The Senate should not be in the business of trying to eliminate the earned income tax credit for a religious or national origin group based on their Texas ZIP Code, ZIP Code.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is an important step forward to improve health care for the 1 in 8 Americans who do not have health insurance and will reduce deficit spending on Medicaid.  Our goal today is simple. To provide health coverage to all of our citizens without waiting for the Federal Government to act. To take health insurance from the 31 million Americans currently without health insurance and give it to those that need it.  The majority of our

In the legislation we will consider later this month, we will add additional tax credits that will enable us to better ensure that American families continue to pay the highest possible rates. But for those families who cannot afford to provide them with the assistance that the SBA offers today and in the future, it will be even worse

Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. This bill contains a host of defense policy provisions that are designed to address an ever- barrassoed defense budget.  There are many things in this bill that I am extremely pleased about, but I will try to come back to one that I feel is most critical to Sanders' and all Americans' defense prospects.  To begin with, this bill includes a $3 billion increase for research and development. While the Defense Department has claimed a research and development squeeze for years, it is important that we look at the real truth

Without the amendment of the Senate Finance Committee, oil companies and foreign governments would face a full 70 percent duty on their refined oil. At present, the only alternative is to

Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers on this amendment and would not have the amendment come up if there were not existing legislation that provides for judicial review of actions taken by State and local agencies that are not subject to Federal law.  The authorizing committee of the Federal Government provided in its rules and bylaws that State and local agencies should have judicial review authority and institutions that might be affected by Federal action or its enforcement.  Unfortunately, Congress's 1996 education, health and safety appropriation bills do not include this language and in fact, does not even

Madam Speaker, if we had a 10-year term limit, and there is a $1 million limit to each individual background check, the NRA and others could not have brought up the need for it or why it was necessary to adopt it when so many other laws dealing with information in the criminal justice system are failing to keep up with the violent crime rate so that children can be safe and parents child-proofed against child predators.  So I would urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and vote for the rule so that we could vote up or down on the rule and bring this bipartisan effort forward.

Mr. Speaker, I just would like to say that while this bill has made many important improvements in the law for people who are most in need in this country, we would not be here today if it was not for the new administration and new leadership in this new Congress in New York, the new Majority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, and the new leadership in Congress in Washington, D.C. It is good for the country, and we think that the American people will find it worthy of the tax payer dollars, in addition to the Federal dollars, as well as the State and local taxes that come from these

Madam Speaker, last month the United States Senate passed legislation to impose sanctions on 10 nations that had violated the Iran nuclear agreement with the United States last year and had recently been asked by the international community to review their past past past efforts to re- earlier agreement.  Last week the House overwhelmingly passed legislation to impose sanctions on Iran over the past years for vetoing most of the requirements of the Iran nuclear agreement and for continuing their illegal negotiations on a nuclear weapon, which I think are demonstrably wrong.  The reason for that is that this country's leadership, the United States Congress, the administration, and the

But on the minutes that have gone by since the Republicans got their hands on this bill the facts do not support this view.

Mr. President, this is a situation where we did the President a huge favor today. He did the people of the State of Arkansas what they wanted and Congress could not do a better job of the National Park Service.  When we had the hearing this morning on what the National Park Service did with the wetlands restoration project, the road canyon repairs, the dam infrastructure, everything was so clearly spelled out that the young Senator from Oklahoma, who is the ranking member of the Interior and Environment Committee, really jumped in and provided his maiden speech. The Senator, frankly, did not need to.  The parks serve as

The President of the United States said that he would address the chairman of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees about flood mitigation.

Madam President, the Nevada delegation is very concerned and has sent a bill to the desk that would grant Nevada State Bank $15 million to fully fund the special economy lending program. This legislation is very important and will assist Nevada residents and businesses to weather climate change and become self-sufficient with an alternative fuel economy. The Nevada State Bank has already made significant progress in Alaska, by requiring that businesses seeking to enter this new business sector operate on an environmental-friendly hybrid blend. Additionally, under the Finance Act of 1997, Nevada State Bank has agreed to convert from a variable-rate loan into a variable-interest rate

Rash and his staffs helped the press cover the events that led to the terrorist attack on the White House in order to ensure that the President's words and comments would be heard.

I have the House on the side of the bill and the Senate bill passed the House and the Senate together this year and they have been working on this tax bill for some time.

Saddam Hussein has consistently refused to give up his ability to manufacture nuclear weapons or to stop the production of CWCMs. It is critical that our theriumified analytes analyzes the Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret Gret minority-owned

I am proud to stand here with my Democratic Caucus colleagues to urge the majority to put this Sacramento river economy on an upward trend for our children and grandchildren.  This bill puts faith in our communities and ensures that Congress is not just stepping on people's rights in California or disregarding the rights of seniors to plan for their own retirement savings, but rather putting them to work.

Mr. Speaker, there have been some other pieces of legislation that have been introduced and pending that would require federal law enforcement to seek out and seek judicial approval of police use of force, and we can only imagine the pain that some could be feeling if they do not have certainty about the process and then have to appeal a ruling in a court of law with the ability to review it and review it in Columbia or elsewhere.  What is truly appalling is the potential impact on the security of our families and our communities as police officers are no longer required to seek the approval of a judge in a given situation. This is

It was designed in 1958 to ensure accountability, transparency, and consumer protection, but it has now created in the real world a situation in which private corporations often control everything from public health and safety regulations to entire government programs.

Mr. President, the amendment I now seek to offer would strike the mandate that certain Federal employees be required to take paid leave to care for a family member or family member for any medical or housekeeping emergency that may occur during the year, as in the case of President Clinton's grandparents. This amendment applies only to Federal employees and is not a Federal mandate nor should it be necessary in order to ensure consent to implementing legislation.  Federal employees are required by law to take paid leave in order to ensure the safety of their family and that of the families of Government employees who care for them or their dependents.

Rather it simply changes the law to allow more Federal regulation of the things that matter most to the States to focus on the subject at hand: research, education, innovation, and job creation.  This amendment makes sense. The national forests are uniquely suited for designation of national monuments under the Antiquities Act. It does not put new authorities into place for Big Oil. It does not force a new regulation on the States.  Every 50 years we rename national monuments in the States to honor an American who has really embodied the virtues of our nation.

This bill was supposed to end the bargaining between state Medicaid agencies and the private insurance industry and allow the States to do what they thought was right. The Medicaid program provides health care for a broad range of health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. They

I think these are the people who, yesterday in reading the President's budget, could not believe what they saw. They

Madam Chair, I want to rise in strong support of this amendment to address a serious issue facing our community today.  This amendment would ensure that the San Jose Water Department does not receive a Federal payment to reverse the environmental liabilities of the adjacent San Jose National Wildlife Refuge. This second- ranking Republican member of the Coastal and Environment Subcommittee, along with myself, unanimously support the Flood Control Partnership Act. As the bill became a reality, the affected communities and businesses not only struggled to pay bills but also faced significant bills to upgrade their infrastructure.  Over the past year, these communities have suffered directly and indirectly due to

<|endoftext|>The National Center for Health Statistics recently released the latest American Medical Association on the health benefits of the Affordable Care Act. This policymaking organization believes that the funds provided through the tax subsidies for small businesses have saved money in Medicare Part A alone and reduced the potential cost of care for Medicare beneficiaries beyond what is now foreseeable. It recognizes that our marketplace understands costs more than the profits of the health insurance industry.  One factor is that Medicare is based on a patchwork of State rules and may lack specific mandates and specific compliance. In addition, the Social Security Administration, which is an agency of the Federal Government

We told the administration that we wanted to provide what we could afford as quickly as possible for what the Republicans had requested was a report that would detail what was going on in Iraq.  In the aftermath of 9/11, I thought we would garner more from the people's money for the reconstruction of our country rather than spending it on unnecessary wars. Yet, after all of the time, money and frustration, I am sure the Bush administration is

Mr. President, last month the Department of Justice filed an amendment in the House of Representatives that would repeal the National Firearms Act provisions on retail sales of gun and ammunition. This amendment would have authorized the sales of large quantities of large amount of guns and ammunition to credit card companies so mortgage dealers, auto salesmen, and gun show sellers could hold real estate together without getting sued for violating the Bankruptcy Code by selling Bryan Avenue in Dallas. The bill was rejected by both Houses of Congress because, as this article pointed out, the right to sell for legitimate use is clearly protected by the National Firearms Act. So

Mr. Chairman, I am not suggesting that we can always reduce Government spending in a balanced way to achieve balance in the Federal budget. However, prevention and treatment for diseases should always be a first priority for the Federal Government.  Yet we are voting on a budget resolution that cuts funding for prevention.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution that will provide for the creation of a program to study the economic and social impact of the health care reform proposals before us today. Agriculture, which supports close to 60 percent of the total gross domestic product, is a major driver of economic growth throughout the country. Reforming the health care system through the private sector and port security is one of the most important ways to stimulate the economy and meet the growing demands of our Nation.  The Department of Health and Human Services, however, is still planning to open Medicare to Medicare beneficiaries who earn less than $30,

Mr. President, President Bush and Secretary Paulson and the rest of the administration are clearly on the way to Iraq. They have taken a firm and measured stance on this subject and have signaled their support for the agreement that was adopted on November 17, 2002. The administration hopes the Iraqis will turn over these weapons of mass destruction. They have even been touting this new, larger agreement as a credible alternative to the option of military action.  But President Bush and the Vice President are apparently willing to risk everything in order to give the President a political victory. They have recently ignored some of the most persuasive evidence of Iraq

We hope, however, that we can come up with some way to accommodate those Senators who have already indicated their amendment will be made in order at this time.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In fact, the reason this subcommittee had not attempted to meet the full number of the student loan provision is because the administration--my understanding--refused to accept that amount of funding.

Madam President, the debate on this bill has been an interesting one in terms of my understanding of it. I think a few things have been indicated that I would like to offer in that time period to kind of settle the situation a little bit more clearly before we move forward and move to a vote this afternoon because it is going to be a very large loss for a lot of reasons. It is going to be loss in the human body, I think. It is going to be loss in the economic system, a loss in the efficiency of government, a loss in many other ways.  But perhaps the most

This budget resolution is a document which, if implemented, would increase spending for investments in education and training programs for the remainder of this fiscal year loan period, and a significant portion of that increase would occur under the Department of Defense by $300 million over the President's request.  The measure includes increased funding for investments in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and mathematics

Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is interested in what the President is working on and plans to make this issue as part of his business as he has one. And I would agree with him that our troops are worn out and do not get the services that they have earned and deserve.  The amendment that he has offered would require the President to do more work to meet the defense priorities that he set, not less. That includes using additional resources to maintain and modernize our Army, Marines, Coast Guard, Air Force, and other military forces. It would also establish a new pool for the education of

He is now the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and youngest Member to chair it. I commend the leadership of Senator Lott and our staff on the majority side of the aisle for the work that has been done to bring this bill to the

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to call to the attention of the Members and the Administration, the Central Coast Interstate Highway System--in particular, the Highway Department--that from 2002 to 2006, our freeway construction work has yielded little to no progress in meeting its Federal quality standards.  First, the Department assured us that its construction project managers would identify appropriate first line infrastructure improvements before contracting any major project. With the money appropriated for that purpose, and the Department's public relations and administrative requirements demanding this assurance, we were under no illusions.

Both of these bills would raise human and moral costs for America and make permanent other recent international treaties with the children of detainees and facilities in the United States. Both of these bills would effectively undermine the longstanding legal status of United States-China nuclear cooperation.  While I support our Nation's national security interest, I oppose these bills because they do not provide sufficient safeguards to stop the transfer of American nuclear technology to China, and because they are fundamentally und

The question is, if we included any money, how would the ranking member respond?  I yield the floor.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill that would correct a glaring oversight in the bill we are now considering and which the Iraqi military has already acknowledged as a problem.  There are only three Iraqi military forces that we know of that have been given Iraq as the headquarters for Iraq's National Congress, the Public Prosecution's Office.  Now, we know that the PMO is to be used for promoting reconciliation with Iraq's troubled political and military leadership, but this bill would make no exception for the PMO because the other three forces are far more capable and competent.  I am particularly concerned

Others may argue that it will give these American workers an additional amount of money to spend on groceries and gasoline. Others may argue that this unemployment extension simply benefits those who lost their jobs.  I think all of those factors have been explored and noted

Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Mitchell amendment which would undermine the so-called Military Forces First provision of the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA.  While I support the underlying bill and intend to vote for the bill in its entirety, I am dismayed by this amendment.  This provision, which is intended to help protect and restore navigable waters and navigation in the Upper Mississippi River and the lower Mississippi River Valley to which the confluence and its tributaries would flow, is unnecessary.

Workers who lose their jobs and are not able to find new jobs and are now living in poverty cannot make it all the way up to the new generation of unemployed people who will have to support themselves and their children, with no means to acquire capital.  During the Clinton years, corporate profits soared to record levels, and it was no surprise to find the highest salaries and benefits at the top of the corporate ladder. But those paying the highest salaries and benefits were the workers on the

It is my intention that the entire House will have a chance to vote this afternoon as to whether or not it mistakenly believes that it has been recognized on this floor for the last 7 years.

Mr. Speaker, we are now debating the Republican tax bill under the Texas sunshine law. This bill is truly an economic assault on working Americans by providing a huge tax break to those making over $1 million and leaving working Americans behind in their efforts to make ends meet with their colleagues who are doing much better in this Congress than they are today with the President.  Mr. Speaker, Republicans propose to give huge tax breaks to the well-off. No more low-income families have to depend on Medicaid to get by, but billionaires have to pay a tax rate that is much higher than that of working people.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This country has a very large and diverse human resources workforce, and one office has it all. It is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, headquartered in Rock Island, Illinois, in the heart of the Midwest. It's really a Reno-based office where employers come to pick up the data and to conduct the necessary tests and safety programs and meet the requirements of Federal and State law. NIOSH helps put the workers and the communities back to work.  One of the biggest challenges of the Affordable Care Act,

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of a family friend of mine who passed away this past Tuesday in Florence, North Carolina. He was president of the Broadwater Baptist Church in Mountain View, a leadership role for whom I have the deepest regard and respect. His responsibilities encompassed working with church leaders to provide services that would promote community, unity, and respect. He served his congregation on a regular basis with a steadfast dedication to his mission.  Fred Coleman served his country with distinction during a career in the Armed Forces that spanned three decades. A graduate of Cabrillo High School, where

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, today I call on the Congress to follow through on the veto request and pass legislation that would amend the Uniform Code of Military Justice to correct one of the most discriminatory provisions of the military laws and regulations which restrict the civil rights of military personnel. The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Burton] has proposed this legislation, and I urge the House to adopt his proposal.  Law Revision 67, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, passed the Congress in 1978 and has remained on the books since. This is an improvement over the law before us today, which contains grossly discriminatory and inappropriate provisions.  On January

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the staff and volunteers of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on their outstanding work in the recent dedication of a new facility in Antioch, Tennessee. Speaker of the House John Sarbanes and I spoke on this issue last week during the Army Forces Command forum. I was pleased to speak out to express our strong support of VA-Chattanooga. As a veteran of World War II and the Korean War, I know firsthand that veterans and their communities deserve better than the present facility in Antioch.  The VFW Antioch facility will be an asset to our veterans community. I would

Mr. President, the Senate has just returned from a recess for 4 days.

I had the opportunity to be on the Hill a little over a week ago for a town hall meeting with constituents in Waterloo, Iowa.  I wish to tell my colleagues, as I did on the House floor, that there are many challenges facing our people, especially in rural America, and that not only are there many challenges, but they

There is a great deal of work that has to be done on this shipbuilding bill, and it will require shaft work, which is a labor intensive, do-it-yourself job.

As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I am proud to have a bill that would help save money by reforming our health care system. But my bill does not change the current system that exists.
