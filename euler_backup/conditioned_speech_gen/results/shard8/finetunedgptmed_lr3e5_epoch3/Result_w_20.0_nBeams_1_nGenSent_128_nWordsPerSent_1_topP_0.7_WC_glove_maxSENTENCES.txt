This was the amount of money which the industry used to lobby Congress for increased Federal assistance to the oil and gas industry.  Now, this is

Mr. President bill I have just brought to the life of the body is Baby Rushing Safety Act.  We have a major problem in our country with infant mortality, and the best we can do is try to increase the number of nurses who are registered with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.  If we do not increase the number of nurses, the industry will lose millions of dollars and thousands of jobs. The problem is that most of the nurses are paid by the hour. They work a full-time schedule, but their pay is limited to the pay they receive for the work they do.  In my home State of New Mexico, we

We are also attempting to do a better job of supporting the disabled, providing them with the tools to make sure they have the ability to do the job.  The question I have for the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Hamilton] is, why is it that the administration, who did not have a budget that adequately supports the disabled, had to cut $30 million out of the fund? It seems to me that there is no justification for that.

I voted for the Government shutdown last month, but now we are seeing a new strategy to undermine our work. It is called a ``working session.''  That is a misnomer. The idea is to bring in as many Members as possible for meetings and votes, while the Republican leader, Mr. Gingrich, waits to offer an agreement. The results will be the destruction of the public's faith in the institution of Government. The process will be known as ``deadlock day.''

Mr. Speaker and senior citizens in the employers that create the jobs and will do the hiring, you know that the IRS has gone from a place where, as a job seeker, you were afraid to apply for the job because you knew that if you were a taxpayer, you were subject to a potential tax liability.  Today, there is a tremendous amount of reform in this bill. The change that is in this bill is the most sweeping change to our tax system in a long time. The bill that we are considering today has a wide variety of provisions that help people and businesses.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

Madam President today I would like to address problems that committee staff and members have encountered with the process of considering the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  In October of this year, the Judiciary Committee began consideration of the nomination of Merrick Garland. During the hearing, it was reported that the Judiciary Committee staff had encountered an incomplete list of 16 judicial nominees. These nominees are all of the ``major'' category--judgeships with a combined caseload of at least 700 cases. As the Judiciary Committee chairman, I made a commitment to the members of the Judiciary Committee to expedite the consideration of all judicial nominees.

Mr. President President family needs $ billion in child care funding to support their children in the first year of life. If this bill is not passed, families across America will have to rely on States and localities to make up the difference.  If we fail to pass this bill, more children will remain in poverty, and children of working families will continue to suffer.  We cannot fail to act.  The time for children's needs is now.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Labor and Human Resources be authorized to meet for a hearing on childcare during the session of the Senate on Thursday, March 1, 1995,

There are many people in this country who have worked to stop the oppression and intimidation of the people of Saudi Arabia.  I think we should be able to take

Unfortunately, there is an increasing amount of misinformation about credit reporting. This is a problem because consumers need accurate information. They need to know how much of their credit is in default. They need to know whether their home is worth $1 million or worth $1 million, and they need to know how much of their income is earned in capital gains. In short, they need to know that their information is being accurate and they need to be able to make good decisions

<|endoftext|>Congress Massachusetts coast, from Long Island to Cape Cod, in a large part of Massachusetts is closed to the public. That is a big deal. This is a small business that does business in the New England area, and in fact, they rely on this road to get their goods to market. This road is closed to the public because of a technical glitch that was discovered by the Boston Fire Department, and they were told to pull that out. This problem would have been resolved with the patchwork of letters, phone calls, and tweets.  This has happened to us in a number of places around the country. As a matter of fact

Mr. President legislative clubs Missouri's First Congressional District have a special relationship with Senator Bill Frist. His tireless advocacy and dedication to the common good have made him a friend of many. In fact, Bill Frist has been a friend of mine for more than 40 years.  In 1978, Senator Frist and I came to the Senate together. Senator Frist became my staff director in 1981, and I later hired him as my chief of staff.  I know how much Senator Frist has contributed to the Senate. His wisdom, humor, and compassion have made him a well-liked and beloved Member of this body.  As a

Mr. President Senate dollars are Federal dollars. They are part of the overall economy. I believe in using our own money, not the Federal Government money, to pay for things that we want to do, but we need to be sure that the Federal Government is doing everything it can to get those dollars to the people that need them the most. I believe we need to make sure we are paying for the things we want to do.  The President has proposed that we pay for everything that we want to do by reducing the deficit by some $70 billion.

HUD's new foreclosure prevention program, which is part of its Community Reinvestment Act, or CARA, will be the largest, most comprehensive foreclosure prevention program in the country. It will provide real assistance to borrowers who have been defrauded by financial institutions, who need to make their lives better, and who need
