I thank my friend and colleague for the time. Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the Antiquities Act in 1906, both Republican and Democratic Presidents have sought to protect and protect resources that are of strategic interest to the Nation. It was President Clinton who once expressed the hope that these treasures could be restored by a majority vote in both houses and signed into law the bill that was just last week to implement that designation for the Everglades in Florida. That was passed at the last minute so that they could get the deadline shut down, so that when the authorization expires at the end of March, there could be no question of getting the restoration of those resources.  Since this is about private property rights, what was wanted to happen is that Congress, as a final agency, not the executive branch, would vote and recognize that the owners of the land on which this bill has been designated have owned that land for a long time and that the proposal to

I intend to just go through these. I am at number 26. I probably have another 20 or so minutes it will take on this. But I just want to go through these one by one. Number one I am going to ask Senator Lieberman to offer his amendment. I think that is number 10, and it gives the court the time to do its work so that the judge of the Fifth Circuit can keep the peace on a traffic stop that takes minutes to try and resolve. He could do so as effectively as one of the other Senators has mentioned, and he says it is good policy. I ask him to do so.  Number 10 I would like to go to. This is an increase in the statute. It allows the District to seize property without a judicial warrant. No one has a right to seize an individual's private property in these circumstances, as they have in previous prosecutions, except for those who are forcibly involved in that

Mr. Speaker, this is quite an interesting debate that we're having, and I think it is an historic day. It is a time when we finally are making a big and historic change in the way this country treats its own citizens. The next day we will have a budget resolution and a spending resolution, and we can and must debate these ideas and move forward to a balanced budget so we can do what every American wants to do in this country: go back to the way things were when this Speaker and this majority came to Washington.  The language we're considering today today has to do with balance-of-payments, child credit, a vote on the balanced budget amendment, and a reauthorization of the earned-income tax credit, which makes a very important difference for millions of Americans who are struggling under the weight of the burdens of debt that is engulfing our country.

Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the Congress will have an opportunity to vote for human rights in China. Some people say it does not work. Well, let me tell you something. It does work because it will take human rights to the Beijing regime and it will stand up against the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Government's violation of human rights. So this issue is not about whether we like it or not. It is about whether we as Americans stand up for those who have the human rights to be able to participate in Nelson Mandela's march against apartheid in South Africa. It is an issue that is so important to the future of this country and the future of human rights in the future of this country because sanctions have failed for the last 20 years.  In 1994, we were able to send a signal to the Chinese Government that we would stand up against its human rights violations. We can now send another signal to the Chinese Communist Party by taking this vote

Now we are faced with a crisis in the West. The issue is whether a 30-year-old approach that costs $5 million or $10 million to install a pipeline into the Barnett Shale that is 400 miles long has worked in West Virginia. It is time to scrap the 50-year-old approach and replace it with one that is 50 percent safer.  The International Energy Agency in their annual State report this year determined that our economic recovery is about to be halted because of the disruption in trade caused by the government shutdown and natural disaster in California.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill that will provide USDA with the resources to reestablish the Department's small irrigation program in rural America.  For too long our Nation's agricultural resources have been squandered on the assumption that we will continue to grow the Western grain industry over the next few decades in spite of its environmental problems. However, under the present system farmers in some rural communities have been forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more for their local water supply complaints and over time to install additional meters and have their systems serviced.  This is a decision that small farmers make on a case-by-case basis in the absence of strong Federal leadership.  A survey last year showed that a majority of farmers feel that the USDA's Western water programs have not been adequate in providing adequate water to the people they serve. Fifty percent of farmers polled by the National Association of Wheat Growers said

But more importantly than that, there is not one single debt yielding Social Security in this country that is not subject to the scrutiny of the trust fund, which could get off balance and, quite honestly, threaten the very security of the present trust fund itself.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me a little time to perhaps explain that one of the reports that was just presented by the Congressional Budget Office was a number of years ago and had a very bad impact on the Republican plan and then again in the last election in the late morning of November 8 because the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who had promised to be there for us that day, today did not come.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. This is an unusual situation that has arisen here. Here we come back to Congress to pay for our cuts to the White House and to the Veterans Administration as we go through a period of great fiscal stress and we find ourselves back here in the same fiscally conservative budget the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Camp) have introduced. There is no question that these are important programs that are now being targeted by this predator bill. But the extreme bill we are proposing has elements of the monster that we know is here; namely, zeroing out the list of programs that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs says that these veterans would benefit from and this bill actually makes that even worse, zooming out the list of additional benefits that these veterans might get; that is, a zeroing out of any additional health care that they might

Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is absolutely correct. I have been astonished at the response by some of the people here in Washington. We are the ones who have been ignoring the fact that Americans are struggling to make a living. That is why it is so important that the President put forward a budget to cut costs.  That is why we have the tax cut, because it will really help the average family in the United States. And what we have done with the Medicare trust fund, although we are securing the future, while preserving what we have and preserving what is affordable, restoring dignity to seniors reclaiming their own money that they have worked so hard for their whole lives, will allow us to make the necessary investments and save what we have.  We need to rein in the runaway growth of the Federal Government. The people in Washington are rising to the occasion. They are fighting the good fight.  We are the people who

Mr. Speaker, Time magazine reported last week that there have been at least 228,000 layoffs in this country in the past 4 months. A national unemployment rate of 8 percent is only less than what we experienced during the worst months of the last recession. There are some bright spots in this economy because some of our most successful companies are still out there taking jobs out of the system and into the work force and making a positive change in our country and making our economy even more so than it has been before this past recession.  We cannot continue to continue to spend more than we take in, as is happening with layoffs in this country. One might assume that as these companies are shutting down, layoffs will rise, but I would ask the Speaker, what is happening in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Massachusetts, in other States around this Nation?

Mr. President, it was my intention, before the leader came to the floor, and also in response to the Senator from Kentucky, to point out that there is no evidence that the Special Trust Fund will be closed before the year 2000 and we are not trying to change the definition of when we do that in this amendment. We are simply saying that what the Special Trust Fund is and what the issue was before the committee was all covered by the bill itself at the time it was drafted. So I think the time that I would like to set before the floor is, at the present time, for the Senator to reach that conclusion, and in response to the comments of the Senator from Kentucky, I will yield the floor at that point.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the problem with this--and I could support it if it were made clearer--is it doesn't take into account that we could have some important legislation passed on the House side as well as the Senate side.

It will do so without going through a legislative process that many Americans find very difficult to understand and not ask for because it would not require Senate approval.

The way to control the Federal debt is to start spending less and, after 1 year, it will be low enough that the Federal Government will be able to pay off the $4 in 5 minutes interest that it will pay on the debt over the next 10 years.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman--my ranking member, my inspiration, Chairman Greg Walden--for his kind words and the time to speak about H.R. 1426, the Energy and Water Development Reauthorization Act of 2015. It is a measure that is well needed and well thought out by the Committee on Appropriations Committee and member support of this bill. This is a good day for America and the Pacific Northwest and jobs in the Pacific Northwest as a whole.  As has already been mentioned in this Special Order, our sector, particularly agriculture, is facing an energy crisis. For example, this summer, Congress authorized the production of nearly 20 billion gallons of ethanol to be used as a biofuel. Additionally, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently recommended that 10 trillion gallons of low-level radioactive waste be stored at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.  This bill would invest in the research and development of alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen and renewable electricity, that can help reduce our dependence

Mr. President, the Senate has just overwhelmingly agreed we do not need the Boren amendment back on the horizon, and I view this as a vote we need to do right now to move things along so we can get to this important legislation to keep our country from going into the next cycle and having a war in the Middle East that will have far-reaching consequences to this country back home, not only the Middle East but all over the globe in terms of its economic strength and in terms of the kinds of problems that are being brought on this country by this example of such overwhelming attacks that have taken such similar proportions to what took place in Kosovo. It is an absolutely overwhelming vote overwhelmingly and bilaterally by the Senate and bilaterally by the administration.  So I urge everyone who has an interest in this legislation--again, I think the record is clearly the House is going to be successful as well. This is a bipartisan effort that will finally

Mr. President, I want to express my support for the hard work of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I believe that the bill before the Senate and the committee is a good bill and that we need to make modifications to the bill for the review of appropriations issues in the year ahead.  As Chairman McCain stated in his statement, the work of the committee and the staff on this legislation will be invaluable in the years ahead as they develop these changes to the bill. However, I believe that there are problems with the bill and other aspects of the defense appropriations bill.  The general manager amendment raises some interesting questions about how the committee will work to fund the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Commerce. Specifically, the amendment proposes to add approximately $6 billion for the administration's account. I believe the committee should accept this amendment and eliminate the additional money for the administration's account.  It is our responsibility to ensure that the

We are spending $15 billion a month on the reconciliation bill. We are going to have to pay for a whole lot more than that when we do this 7 years from now and then it is reduced by 30 percent.

President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and others said they were at war with Iraq when a secret intelligence report indicated that Saddam Hussein had a chief financier who had ties to al Qaeda.

I have the privilege of representing the town of Marietta and the east section of the city in Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, passed the House of Representatives unanimously last month and the Senate received it this past Thursday.  This legislation has two provisions, the first of which is referred to as the National Security Business Opportunities Act, or NBSAA. The other is known as the IDEA bill, which is similar to the Senate bill.  The NBSAA provisions are two important elements in the NDAA. The first of these provisions, authorized under section 3002 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, or IRTPA, is for the creation of national business opportunities to serve as inspiration for the private sector and its employees.

Despite the long tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump has refused to release his, and his spokesperson recently took to the airwaves to call on Congress to investigate the President's refusal to publicly answer questions regarding his personal financial affairs. If Speaker Pelosi did not choose to release his tax returns and denied the committee any members of her committee to question the President about his tax refusal and nominees that he would accept, I would consider releasing the responses of his personal tax returns any time I ever heard them and would continue my investigations. This objection is especially important now as Donald Trump seeks the highest office in the land.  When the Clinton administration released the 1993 tax returns, Republicans in Congress seized the opportunity to actually tell the American people that Democrats had been hiding something. President Clinton said on the campaign trail that his personal financial affairs were just as private as his business activities. I do not want to get bogged down

First, let's take a look at the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, one key provision that has been obstructed. It is an important piece of legislation because one of the important aspects of paralysis is that it is very likely to lead to paralysis in the future and it is important for the important role that the Federal Government has to play in protecting the American public and in helping to prevent paralysis from becoming a key risk factor for long-term paralysis in humans. This is not about Congressional Republicans or Democrats obstructing the legislation; it is about the fact that this provision is critically important for paralysis in humans, and it deserves to be in the bill.  It is also critically important for paralysis in paralysis patients. Christopher and Dana Reeve's tragic accidents provided a unique opportunity for the rehabilitation and medical research and treatment of paralysis, a full range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral challenges.

Mr. President, data has become a form of currency. Today, businesses and government are processing and storing more information than ever. This creates access, organization, and stability in our economy. However, all that information is stored in a form of paper that requires agencies to comply with complicated legal requirements that must be met prior to handing over business secrets.  This means that businesses and government departments cannot rely on data to inform their procurement decisions, or implement meaningful preventive and enforcement measures. Just last year, a national intelligence report revealed that the FBI conducted surveillance on Facebook based solely on Facebook users' knowledge of the company's data privacy practices. This breach of user privacy was solely attributable to a personal failure of the company. That has now put Facebook on notice that any harm that this misuse of personal data might cause is strictly in the form of liability for the impact that is experienced by the privacy rights of all users.

They wanted tax relief, tax relief for the middle class that they said they want when they spoke here in Congress. The funny thing is what the American people did not want is to take the middle class and give it more responsibility, less fear, and more opportunity to save more money, invest more in their children, less fear of taking on a mortgage, and taking out of the housing market.  They did not want to raise the minimum wage. And I'm sure many of the citizens on the other side of the aisle and the people they talk about as being for government spending did not want to put in the minimum wage, because there's less fear in the job.

Mr. Speaker, in January, President Obama took office while facing the worst economic crisis in generations. Faced with that tremendous challenge, President Obama and the Democrats in Congress put in place bold initiatives for economic recovery and expanded opportunities for all Americans, and President Obama certainly should be congratulated for this success story and the optimism that it brought to people across the country. Unfortunately, we are no closer to the worst economic crisis in our Nation's history, however, than we were 4 months ago.  President Obama's slow response to the current economic situation means that millions of Americans are still waiting in line for help. Unemployment is over 10 percent, and many Americans have resorted to simply going without. The United States has been handed a choice: between working for anemic paychecks or risking losing their homes, food, and health care.  Mr. Speaker, our Democrats have shown a rare level of support for the American people, and it's long past time

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to underscore a point that we have been trying to make, and I think it is consistent with the point that we have been making on the floor of the House about the legislation that is before us and trying to explain the reason that the Republicans are not bringing it up on the House floor.  I say this because it seems to me we have to get past these standards and time when it comes to any legislation that involves our most precious Federal resource, our children.  As Speaker Hastert said in his remarks a moment ago, it is as important to the children of this country as the years that have gone by. That is why we are trying to say that this Congress does not want to touch any of that. It is not as if we are talking about any legislation that involves our children, and I think that it is particularly disturbing that our President has even supported this legislation.

Mr. President, when Lavenia McCoy arrived in Bayfield in 1939 as new teacher, she also went to the library to volunteer. She has served that mission well for the past century and more. In 1960 she became the second of four bookshelf clerks in order to put together the board of administration and chairs their salaries. While the initial slate of employees that covered four departments became standard, Lavenia took a bold step. She started the first library in the bayfield area. Not only did she preserve and expand the library and the books, but she also invited students and local leaders to use and discuss the library. Her library has grown to include the Albers, Johnson, Hose, Johnson, Houghton, Walnut, Morrison, and other districts of San Bernardino County, with all its countywide influence on everything from research, to newspapers, to sport, to opera, and even to television.

This does three things. It restores Medicaid coverage for pregnant women and children, both eligibility and benefits; it restores the cut in title 20, which had been offset with a reduction in Medicaid and benefits paid for by other cuts and, as we all know and my colleagues know, they are very much a part of health care reform, all other cuts in health care reform have not been offset; they have not been realized in part because the health care reform law had been put in place. So they restore the Medicaid. We have an incentive now to do that because they say people who have children they want parents and they want in the State government service will get Medicaid. But in a State like my State, the word is not any good to apply to for a foster child as a low-income disabled child, and so we are not going to make any move at all to make that move, even though what we have proposed is to make the

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is moving expeditiously on H.R. 3246, a bill which provides incentives for the U.S. Postal Service to use postal facilities that are in service and that are currently in use by the United States Postal Service. My office has worked closely with Congressman Higgins to draft this legislation and my constituents have been told by Mr. Higgins that I want to support this bill and encourage other Members to support it.  The Postal Service is one of our Nation's most valuable, hard-working organizations. With the support of Congress, postal facilities such as the Depot and Beale Post Office can keep more of their members in the communities they live in. The Postal Service receives much-needed revenues from every purchase of postage. The important thing is that these revenues are distributed to the benefit of all Americans.  As the USPS employee retirement program has expanded, it has been particularly important to not only use tax-deferred facilities but

Mr. President, in Iowa and across the United States, a new school year has begun. As you know, Iowa public schools have an excellent reputation nationwide, and Iowa students' test scores are among the highest in the Nation.  I would like to take just a few minutes today to salute the dedicated teachers, administrators and school board members in the Westland Public Schools District and to report on their participation in a unique Federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities.  This fall marks the 10th year of the Iowa Demonstration Construction Grant Program. That is its formal name, but it is better known among educators in Iowa as the program of Harkin grants for Iowa public schools Fire Prevention and Safety. Since 1998, I have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the State government in Iowa, which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair efforts--everything from updating fire safety systems to building

Mr. President, I want to make a couple of brief comments about the line-item veto, and what the [[Page S4133]] real, fundamental principle is. The President of the United States has the power to do whatever he wishes to do with the people of the United States of America if they are unhappy with the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The House is probably the most dysfunctional congressional body in the history of the United States of America. The Republican majority that was in the majority just a year ago Page S4134]]previously in the House cut taxes and increased spending, cut spending. We had a bill that could have been very difficult to pass on the House side and extremely difficult to pass in the Senate, which was the budget reconciliation. That budget reconciliation was not brought to the Senate for any good purpose. That was an untested, dubious bill. There was talk on the House side--or what is today the majority of the House--

He said it would be unprecedented to enter into an agreement with a Government that would not do this to us or any other country, and he said that Minister Cheng Keung and the Foreign Minister were to be given a free hand to exercise their option.

Representative Forbes and I have been working on this legislation since our arrival in the House as members of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Caucus and also worked closely on other conservation initiatives such as the endangered species conservation program, for which he is also a sponsor.  Currently, the Lower Kiskadzki River's refuge encompasses two places called Traill, Vermont, and Booby. The Traill River has provided over 500 years of recreational and recreational-related flow for the residents of the Derry community.

Research indicates that approximately 15 to 20 percent of all uninsured in America are children. As the leading economic, political, and social force in our society, these children are the primary workers in the United States economy, contributing to the future success of the American economy, but they are also the primary target of inadequate health care.

Mr. President, the assistance in this supplemental appropriations bill for victims of Hurricane Isabel and the California wildfires is certainly much needed and justified. Both natural disasters, both of which have had tremendous impact on the State of California, have been emergency operations that need Federal assistance to support and care for the thousands of Federal and State workers who have worked so hard to put this bill together.  In addition, for the first time in our history, this supplemental appropriations bill provides assistance to victims of the January fires in Oregon, and in effect to victims of the February fires in Washington State.  I commend both the distinguished managers of the supplemental appropriations bill for their efforts to put together a more coherent and responsive law than we normally see from the Congress, in my view. I appreciate the work of the bipartisan caucus for disaster relief and the White House in finding ways of going about the business of containing Federal spending beyond what they did in the past.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 420, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act. The simple fact is, we have too many junk lawsuits being filed in Federal court by plaintiffs who already have a judgment in Federal court and cannot afford the costs associated with going through the system of having to challenge the decision of the trial court in Federal court. When the trial court rules against the reform, we are back here doing nothing, no significant real reduction of frivolous lawsuits.  If we are going to help reduce frivolous lawsuits, let's fix this problem in Federal court, where there are too many.  The Federal court system was designed to take care of frivolous lawsuits. If they are going to be allowed to collect judgments, in fact, they should be. But, instead of tying the hands of the courts, this bill will allow judges to have the discretion to adjust the costs to meet the needs of the plaintiff. The most expensive legal action can be

As we debate the legislation for this week, I remind my colleagues that the bipartisan March of Dimes H.R. 2, the PACE Act, passed this House in March of this year by a vote of 420-2. It is a bipartisan bill that would, for the first time, require a formal risk assessment of Iran's nuclear weapons program before the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] can conduct nuclear negotiations with Iran.

Mr. Speaker, the House wants to pay for tax cuts for folks who have huge tax increases. So a billion people can pay for a million extra days of our lives.

It was just recently reported in the press that the Department of Defense is now working on proposals to implement these plans for more than $300 million in costs and jobs.  The issue at hand is clearly an interrelated issue and I believe the conference agreement reached by the House Committee on Science just passed last night is important for the future of FOLI. This conference agreement will amend the current Federal law to limit the cost of research carried out by FOLI to no more than $50 million, consistent with the DoD position on FOLI.

The women have such deep concerns about this plan that in this past Monday's Washington Post they have a sense of urgency that American women will not support the privatization plans, that a majority of American women do not support this plan.  The fact is, that not only are women's organizations strongly opposed to this privatization plan, but also by the other side of the aisle they are very anxious, and I mean very anxious, to keep this debate secret, to prevent any hard-working, dedicated women from speaking out about this matter.

Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare health plans called cost contracts.

At a time when government spending is out of control, why do seniors need another expensive, governmental way of financing their health care? To increase access to affordable and reliable health care, a few years ago Congress passed the Medicare Modernization Act. Today, seniors can save as much as $100 a month on their health care costs.  Current law allows the private health insurance companies to offer these Medicare savings accounts. If seniors are not satisfied with their private health insurance plans, they can apply for Medicare to be covered by these plans. These plans provide seniors with a set of options to choose from and also include a self-employed option. Unlike private plans, health savings accounts allow seniors

Mr. President, I will speak up to 5 minutes on an amendment that is not in the first package of amendments we will vote on, but I want to speak a little about it today because the Senate should be considering amendments on the issue that the Senator from Illinois is concerned about in the next few days. It is the issue that has been cited by the administration and by the Congressional Research Service report. I want to read that for our colleagues who may be in the hallways right now.  As a result of the increased support for embryonic stem cell research, as a result of this argument, which the President has made many times, that there are unacceptably many unborn children--this is what the story has been told to the country and to me.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers amendment to terminate funding for the space station. It seems to me that we have answered the space program in the past because the American people are to be expected to demand that we spend more in this and this year, next year, and the next year, and that way we will have a balanced budget to respond to what is obviously a pressing problem for our people in this country as well as our space program in this country and our future. I think the logical thing for us to do at this moment is to make the changes that we think are necessary to protect this program for the future of American astronauts.  In general, I am pleased with what we are doing in this bill. This is not an action piece of legislation. We are doing a lot of important things here in this bill.

Madam Speaker, I want to applaud my colleagues, especially Mr. Engel and Mr. McCaul, for sending a strong message with a vote on H.R. 221, the SAVER Act of 2016 to enhance the surveillance capabilities of our intelligence community. The security of this Nation must be our number one priority and has been for decades now. We have the most powerful intelligence community in the world today that has the capability to monitor the world without being directly involved in combat operations, and that should be recognized and respected every single day as the world has changed. This Nation is still the world leader in the country of exploration, innovation, and, of course, robust technology.  As a result of those historic capabilities, the CIA was the dominant agency behind the surge of advances in the digital age that have made us the dominant player in an evolving global economy. As we know, innovation and technology is often the best place to send our children. That is why the SAVER

Mr. Speaker, the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee has chosen the rule for the supplemental appropriations bill to debate the tax bill. I don't think that makes any sense to anyone. It would be so much better if we could vote on this in a more meaningful way rather than after a long delay, much less to yield to the gentleman who actually provides the majority whip on the Appropriations Committee who is so intent on stalling this bill out that he would do the same thing in the House and not be allowed to vote on the Louisiana budget in the same way.  One of the first votes on the appropriations bill will occur around noon tomorrow. It is my understanding that Republicans will demand a waiver on a jurisdictional debate rule for that vote, but we are told by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that he has no intention of challenging the Speaker's failure to allow a timely floor debate on this supplemental bill.

Mr. Speaker, NAFTA is 10 weeks old, and already workers from 50 plants have filed for job training and displacement services. That is 50 plants, workers who are not going to have the work they need when the last bill in Congress was passed last year.  My home State of Washington has three of the last five months of the year left to be out of work before the last year of the last contract expires after this week.  This is a manufactured crisis. The administration continues to try to sugarcoat the adverse effects of NAFTA and a collapse in the Mexican peso. Unfortunately, they just don't get it.  Instead of playing politics with the lives of our workers, Americans and our workers around the world should just use up their overtime pay and get back to working. The President is not offering workers the help they need. He is trying to continue the Bush tax cuts for a few more years, maybe when he is President.<|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2631. Today, about 76 percent of seniors have some form of prescription drug coverage; and less than half of those have prescription drug plans that have taken advantage of the Medicare Part D benefit to extend this coverage to them and their loved ones for an additional year and create a permanent replacement benefit for seniors without Medicare Advantage status. We have to encourage and support seniors to remain in their current plans to maintain their coverage as well as to stay with their physician.  For those seniors, there is a particularly important opportunity to preserve and secure their healthcare. With no expansion of coverage, seniors can expect to see reductions in their benefits--or their deductibles--which could prevent them from obtaining needed treatment.  This bill also ensures that no seniors in Vermont will lose their existing Medicare provider plan or drug coverage. A limited report will be released by CMS every year outlining what they expect to see in this important part of

Mr. Speaker, when Congress passes a 2,000 plus-page bill, it's not all that surprising to find objectionable items tucked away in the pages. Such is the case with this legislation, which sets the Federal spending limit for that fiscal year at $4,331,000 for this fiscal year and $5,232,000 for next year.

At a time when we are seeing annual deficits approaching $1 trillion, and then even reaching $2 trillion if we don't do some immediate and permanent budget cuts, this is just plain wrong.

The Senator and I started this fight back in 2003 when we started a coalition of local governments to try to solve this problem and it took time to get it done. We had to be patient. We have always come to the conclusion that we need to proceed with the Metro program. We have reached out to many local governments, people, and organizations, and we have been pushing to change the formula and changing the infrastructure and some of the laws for over 3 years. I have never been more disappointed.  Mr. President, I urge that the Senate do what is right. Let's go ahead with the Metro. Let's make it work, even though it is not on schedule yet. Let's make it work and not let this administration shut down

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 150, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act. Madam Speaker, in 1788, Patrick Henry and John Adams and the United States Constitution were both created with the support of the press and government to allow for a more just society and a more open government. In fact, in addition to reporting on other violations of the Constitution, the printing press in Virginia on the 15th Amendment and printing houses in 1814 were created to ensure the accountability of government and private industry.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

And yet we're seeing across this Nation a Republican attack on unions claiming that unions are bad. But the great history of this Nation is that it was the Democratic Party and the Nation as a whole that got a step in the right direction and that the last time that this Nation began the decline of unions was under Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the people of this country, from Jimmy Carter all the way up through Senator John Glenn, have fought for the national interest to get our national security out of the hands of those who could actually use that threat. So this House is fighting for the national interest. We're fighting for the stability of our national defense. And yet the greatest irony of all, just yesterday, our Republican friends in the House threw in a 7-year tax increase on American businesses to finance this Iraq war.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill--the ``Innovation Districts for School Improvement Act''--to establish grants to 20 school districts across the country. Through this innovative program, we will be able to use existing technology and technology experience to better understand the needs of our Nation's school districts and to make the most of today's technology to help the most disadvantaged students achieve in their schools and in the rural school districts around the country.  The Innovation Districts program is one of the few examples of innovative Federal technology that can leverage the unique challenges of rural school districts to identify innovative solutions that meet the unique needs of the school districts. The unique challenges of a rural school district may be quite different from those of any other school district in the country, but when they are addressed, they can save time and money. I am sure that my colleague Senator Lugar and others would like to see the opportunity to get this to the school district level, not only

Bill Clinton was saying that we would be cutting taxes because he wanted tax cuts to help the middle class. Bill Clinton did not want to raise taxes on the American people that way because he thought that amendment would raise the deficit and then we would have even more criticism from the left.

And that, Mr. Speaker, is a problem.  It is an example of government excess--and particularly the Federal Government's excessive, runaway, and overbearing spending on research and government

Mr. Speaker, Rush Limbaugh, in an interview with the very distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) asked why would Bill Clinton defend the IRS? Let me just say this to Mr. Limbaugh. He was asked why would Bill Clinton defend the IRS. His response was this: ``Why would he defend it when he wants to eliminate the IRS and take its money and it ought to go to tax reform? That ought to be one of the reasons why he ought to do it.'' And Accountability and Due Process?  My only response to that is the IRS seems to get on board with the liberals' supposed crusade against everything Republicans do, and the IRS seems to get on board with Bill Clinton.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 31, the United States imported 7,140,000 barrels of oil each day, 246,000 barrels less than the 7,200,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago.  Americans relied on foreign oil for 54 percent of their needs last week, and there is no sign that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 28 percent of America's oil supply September 19 until March 31 2005 January 26. During the same period a decade ago, foreign oil accounted for only 22 percent of America's oil supply. The Institute projects that if current trends continue, the United States will be dependent on foreign oil for approximately 75 percent of our oil needs by 2008.

Mr. Speaker, according to Medicare trustees, that program requires an immediate 51 percent cut, a payroll tax increase of 122 percent, or a blend of both that they know will only take effect in 2008 because they will not pay for it with the increase in their own Medicare trust fund.  These trustees believe that the President and the Congress have already made the program more vulnerable than it has been over the years. These trustees also believe that the bankruptcy courts will rule against the administration's request for a 2 percent cut over 3 years in order to force seniors to rely upon the discretionary funds of the trust fund.  Do not be fooled. Despite the President's claims that this program will be solvent for 20 years, seniors will not receive the promised benefits unless the President and Congress can force drastic cuts in spending.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I would like to rise to say a few words about the Mexican debt situation and about our relationship with Mexico. I have to say it is no surprise that I will be a cosponsor of this important amendment to make sure Mexico can continue to service its debt obligations to the United States without being taken advantage of as a trade target by the United States Government or other countries in the world. Because of the current economic terms of the country and the current economic situation we have in Mexico, our country has had to continue to rely heavily on the foreign markets to satisfy its budget problems. We are now tied to our largest trading partner in the world, Canada.  As a result of the current circumstances and because we now depend heavily on these markets, Mexico has to be very careful about how we spend our money. Because of that, I think it is absolutely vital that our foreign trade and our trade deficit, when it affects

On June 11, the Senate will once again commemorate the life and service of a veteran who served our country with great honor and distinction.

His distinguished service and the 10 years of distinguished service which he received while at the helm of that agency will help us to think about the past rather than the present.

Madam Speaker, this amendment is a perfect example of how people can fall off both sides of the same horse at the same time. If you understand this bill and the underlying bill, you understand that we're on the right path with health care reform in this country, not on the wrong path. That is the way this bill works.  If Members on the other side believe that we can reform and move the way that we should reform and move this country proactively in health care reform, then come to the House, come to the Rules Committee, come and find the members of the Ways and Means Committee that can work in a bipartisan way and pass this legislation.  We have some 24 Republican and four Democrat cosponsors on this bill and on other pieces of legislation that we can move forward with and get a win for American families. This is not our time to do that.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor

Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation, with the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. McMillan] that will provide significant health care savings for our constituents. The cost of doctor visits is skyrocketing and doctors are now accepting patients in North Carolina hospitals. My legislation would prevent doctors from charging patients a fee that they could not afford and would also reduce physician supply, reduce hospital inflation, increase enrollment in private sector health insurance, and would allow doctors to deliver lower priced, greater quality health care.  Mr. Speaker, there is a limit on physicians and how many visits a physician is willing to take, and current reimbursement formulas punish doctors and hospitals by limiting their number of medical services. I believe this is unjustified and needlessly hurt the practice of medicine in my district.  Physicians are as qualified to treat high blood pressure as any other patient. No physicians should be required to perform unnecessary tests, simply because they are a physician.  This is why

Well, this week we have just disproven two items of Republican orthodoxy, and that is corporations don't pay taxes, only individuals pay taxes; and tax cuts paid for by corporate welfare are about $40 billion over 5 years and money we pay to private businesses which pay our taxes is about $50 billion. This is the kind of two-faced politics that has been unkind to both the American people and American business. Companies don't pay taxes because the Federal Government taxes their aviation fuel, their air freight, the Internet tax, the gas tax, and anything else. The Federal Government doesn't pay taxes because the private sector cannot be taxed.  Now, people think corporations are just big businesses that collect their tax from no other source. They are a huge part of the problem, because most people who buy personal goods do so because they know what the deal is, they know what the weight is, they know where it comes from. But the

Mr. President, Richard Dudman, one of our Nation's most esteemed journalists, passed away at his Maine home last night. I rise today in tribute to him and the many great contributions he made to our Nation during his career.  In 1947 when I was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Richard was the only journalist to work on the Capitol Hill press office staff during the first term of the first distinguished member of the Second District of Maine in my award-winning book, ``The Battered Soul of America: The Untold Story of the Press, or, How the U.S. Capitol Led the Nation in Deception,'' which I did not initially publish. At the same time, in 1949, he was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, and as the two United States Representatives from that seat, continued to contribute greatly to our campaign and to our news media throughout his career.  Richard began his broadcasting career as a

Reclaiming my time, that is only the point I want to make. I am not speaking to the issue of the amendment. I just simply want to say that I think we are right in not just trying to say we do not want to make good on what has been done, but we also do not want to make good on something that has already been done and something that might be done because it is kind of the mind of the matter why we should not do something that we know that is right in this question of the Federal Government and that is a good idea for the Federal Government but it also might have a local aspect and it is no trouble to do so and send money to localities because we are sending money back. The State of Alabama already has enough Federal money to solve all of these problems that are out there that the Federal Government can't solve them.

Mr. President, on May 26, President Clinton made the difficult and courageous decision to renew most-favored-nation tariff status for China, and end the linkage between this status and economic development in China and other countries in Asia. In so doing, the Clinton administration opened China to new markets and made China a full partner in the global market system and of human rights in the United States. However, despite the progress China has made in recent years and because of China's growing economic and political interests in China and the Chinese people and culture, the Clinton administration has also made clear that, until the final years of this Administration, we would remain very concerned about China's continued unspeakable human rights violations against its own people and its own lawful cultural and religious practices.  The administration's stated policy toward China is based on three key principles. First, the United States does not favor trade deals that favor certain nations, such as China. Second, we don't think

Madam President, today I wish to highlight the 100-year history of the Triangle Cooperative Service Company of Enid, OK. This year, 2016, is their 100th year of service with more than 400 members in service in the State of Oklahoma and the country. Triangle has gone through 100 years of history of service to the entire State of Oklahoma and has been a local agency since the very first development of a way to bring productive worker training to communities like Enid. It has been a pleasure for me to have the opportunity to highlight the unique contributions Triangle is making to our community.  Since 1871, Triangle Cooperative has worked in the United States on projects to reduce crime and improve the lives of Alaskan Oklahomans. The Triangle Cooperative Service Company of Enid, Oklahoma was first incorporated in 1871 and the first public employee service club. In 1916, they relocated to Enid to provide quality services to the surrounding communities. In 1948, the cooperative

Over the past year signs have been flashing that the price of gasoline has increased to nearly $4 per gallon. Natural gas has skyrocketed to $1.35 a gallon, the second highest price in the United States.

The Committee on Education and the Workforce held an entire week of hearings on this bill in the Republican Congressional Black Caucus's Subcommittee on the Constitution, the Congressional Review Act, and the Budget Act, and my subcommittee held three hearings on it in the Labor Committee this year.

Madam Chair, Governor Brown notes that Oregon was the first State to have automatic voter registration. It went into effect in 2015 and has added nearly 25 percent to Oregon's population and some 11,600 more votes than voters who registered early and used their Governor's signature on the voter registration card. Without that protection, the entire system of voter registration could be in doubt.

What they want is a Medicaid and Medicare waiver and a welfare waiver is when a State says, ``We want to take the poverty resolution away from Washington State to give Medicaid to the poor of this country.'' So why should we not say that, ``We want to reduce poverty in this country''? That should be in the bill. I do not know what their philosophy is that makes the poverty issue so important. There are very few States that have it as high as Washington State. So we are all for doing that. But the philosophy should be in the bill and not in what is being proposed here. If people think it is important in the State of Washington, why is it not a big deal here and the notion of welfare as a formula is so effective in this country, why should we take it away and say we want to do that in a State where they say that? They have no problem with that. There are

Mr. President, before my friend from Washington State leaves, I want to thank her for her advocacy on water infrastructure, and I agree with her there needs to be a full review of the failed policy of allowing the States to do this work without Federal support. I hope she will be working with me and with other Senators to make sure that the water infrastructure needs of this country are addressed in health and safety and environmental policies as we move forward to address the national and regional security needs we face in the 21st century.  I thank the Senator from Washington State for her leadership in this effort and her sameness of perspective and her indefatigable support for the basic goal of ensuring that we move forward, making sure the water that flows through our homes and our streets and the water that travels across our bridges and our reservoirs and our pipelines does not pose a threat to any citizen's safety or the security of the next generation.

If they are using it, this procedure is unconstitutional. We do not require estimation of that. We have a medical procedure that is done in every abortion clinic in the Nation.

Mr. Chairman, hard-working American families are paying a high price at the gas pump today because of our Nation's dependence upon foreign energy. Every day American consumers pay up to $3,700 in gas taxes to fund Federal environmental programs that result in the waste and destruction of private property in many communities across the country. In our communities across the Nation businesses have gone bankrupt, filling the void that is created by the inability of our local governments to manage resources and provide clean water for their citizens.  I have introduced the Energy Sustainability and Community Block Grants Act which would provide Federal funding for community block grants so communities across the country can better manage and conserve energy in order to create jobs and better service. According to the National Federation of Independent Business, this legislation would provide $29 billion a year in low- and no-income energy assistance for 7 years.

Madam Chair, this amendment reflects a simple principle. The government does not and should not have unchecked power to track American citizens. There are many ways to enact effective government accountability, and the amendment before us addresses a few of them.  The amendment calls for the FISA Court to issue a broad-based report on data collection and analysis that database partners like the Government, contractors, and other entities collected in the USA FREEDOM Act. This information is used to build an excellent picture of any abuses and threats that may come to light. We can be sure that the FISA Court, as it properly oversees and reviews that data, will have the information and will use it to punish violators.  So my amendment would require that the FISA Court do not err in determining whether there are abuses of surveillance authority under the USA FREEDOM Act in order to appropriately sanction or prosecute these violators.  The Federal Government's complete and accurate information-

Mr. President, I have had discussions with my friend, the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, with Senator Dole, and with other members of the Appropriations Committee, about what we might do with Senator Dole as we go forward with this appropriations bill. Obviously, with our differing views about some issues, it has not been the best possible time for this to come to the floor so quickly to be called up by the President in interest of putting into operation something that has had such a dramatic impact. The reason it is needed is because so many of the States that had population growth in excess of 50 percent in 1994 have a projected population growth that is within 10 years. So they are worried. We are also concerned about the judicial retention of African American and Hispanic judges in the various Federal courts. We are concerned about that, and there has been an evaluation of the Federal judiciary from the U.S. Institute of Peace, as well as the National Review

Under current law, the Consumer Product Safety Commission is completely divided between the FTC and the Food and Drug Administration.

I have long supported legal aid programs that assist veterans who have been exposed to the legal process through service in the Armed Forces. I believe that it is important that the military have legal representation to the extent that it will allow it to fight decision-making in a fair and impartial manner.  Veterans in particular have been able to successfully advocate for their benefits while retaining legal representation. The effect of this move is to prevent the military from having to hire a legal firm to represent them when they are otherwise ineligible for an appointment by the Court of Veterans' Appeals.

As a distinguished Member of this body from 1959 until 1969 when he retired, Mr. O'Neill demonstrated his principled stand for the people of New York by voting in favor of the United States interstate highway system in a bipartisan vote. As a respected person by all who knew him, he took the time to send his father's son along as the Chaplain at all his funeral services.  I think of my colleagues who preceded Mr. O'Neill when they recalled the Biblical story of Job who had difficulty using a building ladder because the ladder was too high.  I am grateful to the Speaker of the House and the majority leader for bringing

Madam Speaker, Republicans are holding tax cuts for the middle class hostage as they try to extend tax cuts for millionaires. They say letting tax cuts for the wealthy expire at the end of this year is tax reform so that they can spend all of the time talking about the budget deficit instead of doing what Democrats in the last couple of years have done for seniors and the working class, which is get a job.  In the short-term, Republicans will allow a few tax breaks for the wealthy, but with the long-term plan we want to be for everyone else, let us end the loopholes and let us go to permanent tax cuts for the middle class.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

As the first of the Texas Army National Guard and as an Army Reserve military professional who deployed in the first world war as a machine gunner during the Tank Battle of Hill 67 on August 2, 1944 in Brest, Belgium, Sergeant Evans later served his country with distinction as a lieutenant general in the 442d Regimental Combat Team who Thompson testified said was ``excelled as a combat leader, tactician, and leader, able to take orders, control resources, or coordinate actions around the clock, time and again.''

Mr. Speaker, the point that the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Simmons) made about Admiral Allen being nominated by the President and put in charge, I think, is correct. This is an extraordinary man and I think of him as a gentleman of remarkable caliber and experience who served in the Marine Corps from 1963 until 1989, where he served as a Navy commander, a major general in the Marine Corps and simmons the 9/11 Commission as its chairman. He also served the Congress for 2 years as the assistant majority leader of the Senate Republican Conference in Connecticut and served here in the Congress. I think there are many reasons for the State of Connecticut to support our Commander in Chief, but he comes from an extraordinary family and background and I think we should be very happy to work with him on this and perhaps to bring him in as a member of the Armed Services Committee in the House. He would do an outstanding job.  The SPEAKER pro

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act, H.R. 9, and strongly oppose the Gohmert amendment. It reduces the legislative provisions on voting rights of the House that Congress enacted in 1965 to such provisions contained in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as expire at the end of the year.  It is a disgrace that the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Gohmert] wants to create some unnecessary barriers to voting for other people of color.  Today, minority voters cast between 63 and 69 percent of all the votes in the U.S. Congress. The percentage of African American voters in the Congress, well over 70 percent, represents a massive proportion of the voting population of the United States. It is estimated that there are almost 4 million voting aged and minority voters in this country. Most African American voters do not support elections to Congress or will vote for a Presidential candidate if he or she were to become President

Mr. President, today I rise to honor the career of an outstanding individual, Chief Judge Robert Bell. Judge Bell is a trailblazer, a stellar legal mind and a true public servant. Judge Bell began his public service today as a D.C. District Judge in 1985 and began as a jurist in 1982.  Judge Bell began his law practice in the city of Chevy Chase, AL, in 1983. At the time, he and his wife Dr. Gail were on the rising star run for the city council. And within 2 years, the Bells would be the first in their family to hold public office.  When Bill and Gail Bell decided to dedicate their legal career to serving their community, so did more than just their son. They devoted their lives to the public interest and wanted to give back to that community they had given so much to. ``We are better served, the city better served,'' Gail Bell said in

But let me put that as another aspect. A lot of the time we hear the President saying he does not want judges appointed. I am one of those people that believes he does not want judges. In fact, he has appointed thousands of judicial nominees to be Federal district court judges and State appellate court judges. That is one area. He has appointed district court judges.

Madam President, if you look back to 1968-69, back when we used to have budgets from July 1 around the clock to June 30. We did this under a Republican administration and the Budget Control Act. It was in the Republican budget that we reduced spending $2 billion in the year 2001 and increased taxes $3 billion over the next 10 years. This came on top of going after Medicare and Social Security and taxes that were meant to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.  In many ways, the commitment to the balanced budget amendment was not a partisan matter. In fact, almost every Member on both sides of the aisle voted for it--except the Senator from Louisiana. Then in the year 2002 and 2003, as a matter of principle, we all voted for an increase in the debt ceiling to increase our ability to balance the budget.  Today, we are not just going to increase the debt limit for 7 years, and then 4 years

The problem is that they did not agree to give the majority's option. They chose the Republican choice.

Mr. Chairman, the National Science Foundation employs almost exactly the same number of people in 1994 as it did in 1984, that despite a 2.5 percent increase in the size of the program over the last two decades. The President has tried to deny the need for these people and the program would be better off without them. I think he is correct that the Federal Government would be better off without these, I think, loyal, competent public servants.  I would ask the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) this question, because, as we have been discussing here today, the Government spends 2.2 percent of its GNP on salaries and expenses, while privately owned companies, private corporations, spend up to about 7 percent. It seems to me that the Federal Government ought to be paying for those expenses. We need to pay for the programs ourselves, not contract out.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, what we have before us today is the same conference report as before, but it contains $34 million in cuts to $14 billion in medical research programs within the Veterans Administration. This committee voted 95 percent in favor of the Medical Research and Quality Improvement Act. Unfortunately, the Committee on Appropriations chose to leave this amendment in the conference report that was approved by the Senate.  I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that it is not my intention to raise the debate on the merits of medical research but simply to make a point and to encourage the veterans themselves to support this amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I think we can probably accept the fact that this Congress is now halfway through its fiscal year.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the substitute offered by the gentlewoman from Hawaii. I consider this substitute to be the most viable welfare reform package currently before Congress. It will better serve Hawaii, reduce welfare spending by a significant amount and do it while making sure that the Government remains on a cost-effective and conservative path in spending and reform. It is a Republican substitute that makes this work.  This bill simply puts the welfare check on the table for Hawaii. It will reduce the amount of money to be spent on AFDC and will save the Government money. In order to achieve these goals, it is essential that we increase these block grants to make sure that it works for all recipients of welfare. The bill has also allowed full debate and, in my opinion, adequate time for the Members of the Hawaii Legislature to produce a package that meets the challenge of providing welfare benefits and keeping the Government off the taxpayer's books.

We have the Federal Government in charge of the health care system. They get access to a list of plans from Canada's private insurers. What we do in this legislation is we take money from the Federal Government and put it in a pool and we try to help hospitals in the medical marketplace more by giving them more and better insurance pools.

We have seen the Oklahoma City investigation, that was well funded by the taxpayers of this country, that killed people and destroyed and damaged property. We have seen the military construction that was all or part of the bill that Mr. Weller mentioned that moved forward in part as a result of what we saw the chairman of the Appropriations Committee doing at the Pentagon.  What I think is very clear in this area is we have

Mr. President, I am concerned that we seem to have these divisive nominees. The Republicans are unwilling to bring forward Judge Edward Prado to the Federal bench as he is the nominee for the Eastern District of Texas and the Senate Republicans are unwilling to bring him up and debate him until the Senate majority leader has the opportunity to move to a vote on the nomination in a very short time after the Senate votes on the Republican side. Senator McConnell has stated that he would support his nomination if Senator Schumer and Senator Reid could agree on an amendment to Senator Schumer and Senator Reid would vote Democrat on the substance of that amendment, which is a proposal from Senator Schumer to change current law. But it is my understanding that those parties are not working together on the substance of that amendment. Is it not my understanding that the underlying bill is passed, as we have heard, by the Senate, and the amendment Senator Schumer and Senator Reid would propose to change current law would

Mr. President, I appreciate very much the distinguished majority leader trying to figure out a way to get through this impasse. It is in the best interest of the Senate and the Nation that we work together to avoid the potential gridlock and difficulties that could be made if we cannot resolve the matter on the budget. The leaders have had discussions to try to make sure that is possible. We all realize that there are a lot of difficult issues out there that must be resolved before we can work any closer together on any proposal that might emerge from this Congress that may reach a compromise on alternative solutions for resolving this estrada issue. But I believe we should find a way to get through this because it is a bipartisan issue and this will ultimately ensure adequate consideration by the Senate budget legislation package itself.

Mr. Speaker, it is easy to tell where President Bush's priorities lie when you look at his proposed fiscal year 2008 budget. It is with that in mind that I want to begin by thanking President Bush for his budget's embrace of fiscal discipline that can help bring our debt to historic lows by tackling a variety of spending and tax proposals that would make our country more efficient and help make it easier for our hardworking hardworking Americans to get back on their feet after a tough economic start to a new job for a good easy paycheck.  Specifically, the President's budget supports investments that will ensure that all Americans have access to the latest education technologies, real opportunity to fulfill their dreams and raise their wages and the most secure and prosperous economy the world has ever known.

Mr. Speaker, 227 years ago 56 men put their lives, their families and fortunes on the line as they defied the most powerful country in the world to stop a small army of four British soldiers who were captured in combat and wanted to be taken to a British military base in Iraq. There they were taken from their families and were held in Iraqi jails without the assistance of lawyers or civilian officials who had the responsibility of bringing them to justice and for which they were not even allowed a day in the Iraqi people's courts. In all this time and without legal support or the freedom of speech to defend themselves they were held against their will for 22 days in Iraqi military forces prisons for which they were never charged. This barbaric action by British forces in 1942 against two unarmed Americans in a place of their choosing has been called an act of war.

Madam President, the coronavirus pandemic continues to challenge our Nation, and the Senate is here working for the American people. Our committees have called in bipartisan fashion and brought legislation to the Senate floor that will strengthen the American economy and restore the healthcare system to full health.  Each of us has a shared interest in ensuring the Trump administration can safely contain this deadly virus before it spreads beyond our borders. My home State of Vermont is in the midst of the worst outbreak in our Nation's history. Sixteen people have died in this outbreak, including two who died of septicemia.  I have met with health care providers, first responders, and government officials who've dealt with this crisis firsthand. A primary concern I have is that this pandemic is having an impact on our communities and our economies. In a recent conversation with a senior executive at one of the big Vermont hospital systems, she asked me about the impact the virus has had on the

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will not object, while the Senators who had expressed their concerns may be correct, I believe the way the resolution now is drafted is that the interest of the Senate would be to give them the opportunity to provide their sense of what the situation might be if this needed to be done. But it would not be a requirement for the benefit of the bill. The Senate could insist upon being notified of any determination of the board, but that is not the purpose of the rule.  The  impeachment inquiry pursuant to the Constitution must concentrate on some specific offense and only resolve the remaining pending issues related thereto, shall not involve reserved offenses or unfunded constitutional duties, and be limited in its jurisdiction to only the enumerated acts of impeachment.

There are 48 States and the District of Columbia which permit religious schools under State law from being affiliated with a local district's education plan.

There are 54 additional States which allow churches to be used as educational entities, and as soon as they adopt a State law authorizing the use of the name of any religious denomination or religious group on any federally funded assistance--other than education or recreation--it is the understanding of the committee that if there is a restriction on Federal participation in a school in the District, other than vocational rehabilitation or teaching, that those restrictions shall not apply to a religious organization.  <|endoftext|>

During the process that led up to the passage of the Medicare prescription drug bill last year, many people claimed that the prescription drug bill would hurt seniors.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe the 100th anniversary of Muir Woods National Monument, located in Marin County, CA. It was U.S. Representative and chairman of the National Park and the Presidio Subcommittee of the Resources Committee who brought this to the attention of the American people on December 11, 1921 when he first described the county in which the monument now resides and the importance of maintaining it as a national monument. Over the years, it has grown and evolved into a nationally significant monument, as designated under title V of S. 1729, the National Trails System Act of 2006.  This monument is a tribute to two men: one a champion of trails and one a trailbuilder. Since the site was first designated in 1960, there have been many events highlighting the success of trail development and trail maintenance in southeastern California, and the area can be especially well known for the glorious Golden Gate Bridge. That was the favorite climb, The Golden Gate

Madam President, I applaud the work of Chairman Dodd on this issue, as on so many others--fighting the terrible problems of credit card abuse, dealing with risk with credit card companies and how to prevent credit card fraud. I think we are at a terrible place. I am very grateful to my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd, who did such an amazing job managing this bill. It has been incredibly productive on both sides of the aisle and I am grateful.  Madam President, with this important bill moving through the Senate, it is appropriate that we step back and look at the cost to consumers and lenders alike--especially those who pay them or have them buy their credit--for good Government. What would the best way be for Congress to promote good Government?  That is the question that I pose as an outlier to this Congress. I don't believe we can think of many activities more high-risk than tackling fraud and crime in our

Mr. Speaker and colleagues, it is a great pleasure this morning to join in welcoming my cousin, the pastor of Immaculate Conception Church in Clinton, North Carolina, my good friend and my partner and the member of the Special Order Hour in the United States House of Representatives tonight afternoon and evening to talk about the life and the career of one of the most eminent leaders in the African-American community in the United States today to join my friend from North Carolina and others in the House of Representatives today in the House of Representatives on Friday evening morning for a Special Order hour.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to begin my comments by extending my heartfelt condolences to Pastor McLeod and his family. His entire family, just his wife and two children, sent a most heartfelt Christmas wish, and I think that is really the way we should act here.  For many years, his family has been humble and accepting in this issue, and he has inspired his

Mr. Speaker, I would trust that the gentleman was unaware that Mr. Fitzpatrick also does have a bill that only freezes our pay, and it only is 1 year. But I can tell you he and Mrs. Fitzpatrick and everybody else who happens to work for the Federal Government do not get Social Security benefits. It does not matter whether it is a private business, a union, or a government agency. They get that when they retire at age 65. That is something you ought to be cynical about as we go through a 21st century, and we have been cynical about it, trying to help this economy, trying to deal with the people who work for our Government. But this is one of the reasons that we are hearing that so many of our Democratic colleagues have not put forward a plan.  We have heard all of their talking points. I do not even know whether to be a gentleman or a woman or to even be a Republican

Madam Chairman, I rise today with this amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. This amendment would direct the Army Corps of Engineers to reduce the existing Dam Safety Officer Corps at Watertown Dam in North Carolina to a full-time safety officer with the support of river river tourist industry leaders and property owners. Currently there are only three full-time safety officers in the Watertown Dam Commission and these people do a good job on flood and erosion mapping and mapping of other issues related to water quality and environmental concerns. We have a need to help these important energy and water sector leaders. The language included in the underlying bill, H.R. 6, would set this target at 5 full-time staff members.  Watertown Dam is one of the nation's largest inland reservoirs. For the first time in history, the dam is using real-time lightning strikes to direct its control system. Every acre of the dam generates electric power and
