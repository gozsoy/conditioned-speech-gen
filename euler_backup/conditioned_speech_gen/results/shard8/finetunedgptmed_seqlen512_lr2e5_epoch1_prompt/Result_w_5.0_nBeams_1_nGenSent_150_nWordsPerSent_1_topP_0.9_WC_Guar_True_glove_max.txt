shut legislation republican 

Final sequence: 

I thank my friend and colleague for the time. Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the bill to impose the legislation that Congress had voted to pass back in 2010 in January of that year, there has been over 2,700 hearings on the Senate bill which Congress overwhelmingly passed back in January of 2010 and which Congress has shut down since then, with no hearings to look at it or to come to any conclusions as to what should be included in this Republican stimulus package.  So what the bill that we're going to vote on tomorrow contains is an amendment I filed just a few days ago, and that's an amendment that has to do with inflation, and I would just say that, again, the Senator is absolutely correct that that's exactly what we have. We have a bill that's been put forward that includes inflation.  <|endoftext|>

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, this is quite an interesting debate that we're having, and I think it's a way to put some context to the way that we approach public policy decisions around here and government practices around the world. But I think it's important that we just make sure that the House continues to work on a bipartisan basis to bring a comprehensive reform bill to the floor that could be passed cap-and-trade for the first time in a decade.  For example, some of the provisions in this bill that are overdue legislation were, in fact, contained in the bipartisan bill that passed the Senate but was never enacted into law, S. 1337. Now, there have been some other things as well, but S. 1337 was not the result of a hardworking debate on a bipartisan basis in the House.  So as we

Strikingly, the PRO Act would destroy employee privacy rights by requiring employers to give away personal information about employees to government agencies that are out to get them. The act also would require employers to remove employees without cause at least 60 days after workers first receive the job offer. The real implications of this bill go much further than that which has been just emerging today in the papers and on the front pages of the business economy.  It is highly unlikely that the corporate and financial powers that be in America will be able to prevent the pro-work group destroy our economic liberty by granting the government the right to access and use certain personal information.

Our economy relies on exports of goods to China and the fact that they trade sanctions. For over 30 years, America has stood by China and the Chinese Government has continuously flouted China's trade sanctions against America.

Now we are back here debating the so-called repeal bill with the same reforms. We made the situation right. We are reversing the two things that Congress mandated.  We already passed tax relief to our families that extends the Tax Code to spur economic growth.

The amendment is opposed by the White House and all those who oppose it on the grounds that it does not provide adequate funding for employment discrimination protection. The Department of Labor reports that 18,878 farmers and 5,628 agricultural workers lost their jobs in the short-term credit market when the program was terminated. This means that an increase in the program's authorized level will have a huge adverse effect on the farmers' ability to get the crop insurance they need.

There was the initial presence of more than 1,300 tanks and jeeps deployed to protect peaceful protestors, beginning as soon as the first tear gas was deployed. It is not clear that that number was actually equal to or larger than Indonesia's present strategic needs and capabilities. It was only when a colonel stepped forward and identified the attack on the demonstrators as a terrorist act that further tanks arrived and established a zone of safety

The new interactive site offers individuals with knowledge of environmental risks from other sources, such as past events at the Winter Olympics, the Zika virus, and other such information, valuable information that can be used to help residents of that region safely plan their

Let me restate my interest in expediting the reuse of these properties. But it must be noted that the Federal Government is going to make the decision on the properties. It is up to the States to decide whether they are going to use the property or not to use it and whether that would impact whether they would be able to interest rate the Federal Government for the time that it would take for them to come in and discuss the question of the future return on the capital that has been made in the program that the State has taken the initiative to conference.  Mr. President, I hope the majority leader will allow this bill to go to conference at the earliest possible time.

Mr. President, responding to my friend, it seems quite unusual that these crocodile tears are being used to justify the Clinton administration when it is Republicans who are the ones in the majority in Congress who want to stop the war in Iraq. The Senate is in the majority and this is the first time in history that I think the Republican leader is being kind enough not to use the excuse of what is a very important national issue as a way to just not be considered at all when it comes to a bill that is of such concern to the American people. I would say to Senator McCain it was because Arizona had a statewide referendum to ban stem cell research, and the voters rejected that. I do not think it is appropriate to be arguing the point, if we are supposed to be in the majority, of the Senate in trying to stop the President

I think this bill is good for Main Street workers and for the stability of our financial services industry. It will yield much-needed tax relief and we need it to be paid for.  First, let me take a moment to commend Chairman Levin for his hard work on the bill, and thank him again for supporting the inclusion of a bipartisan bill to advance worker self-sufficiency and economic security, which I strongly support.

Mr. Speaker, let me tell Members what this debate is all about. It is about a lack of opportunity for American farmers.  The Republicans claim that this bill would reduce the number of unemployed who are now available for an opportunity to work because of the farm bill. I strongly disagree with that statement because we know that the Democratic leadership and Speaker Pelosi deliberately gave more than a million farm families the opportunity to work.  We also know that the Committee on Agriculture worked diligently to find ways to benefit American farmers by providing for farm lending for over half a million farmers.  And on top of this, we know that over 15,000 farmers, including I-93 or I-66, and many others who are not yet farm owners, are eligible for loans in this bill, to repay mortgage interest and other forgivable loans that have already

It is vitally important to our economy, as is giving rural America, which is very special to my State, greater flexibility to be able to create, create jobs, grow. This bill will permit us to do that.  This amendment does two things: First, it preserves and extends the prohibition on cooperative agreements.

This was a bill that was put together largely out of a bipartisan effort by Senator Schumer and myself. The bill before the Senate today takes an important step in making basic safety programs--like reporting rape kit cases to the police--more robust and effective. But more importantly, it also adds important tools to help police and prosecutors take actions against perpetrators of violence against women.  But these basic safety programs can't do it alone.

american objection disclosing 

Final sequence: 

Despite the long tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump and those who oppose his removal have a choice of rhetoric and policy to follow. In the words of one of the American Medical Association's international physicians, ``No Member of this House should justify withholding the financial disclosure of a Member of Congress due to objections to an otherwise responsible practice.'' As physician for more than a quarter century in this House of Representatives, I understand that withholding disclosure is not appropriate for disclosing a Member of Congress' financial information and that conscientious patients should never be penalized for doing so.  In our history, the decision as to how to treat the Constitution's separation of powers is a compromise. Our Founding Fathers understood that one branch of government should guard the people's will and that the other should leave that will to the people and

First, let's take a look at the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, one key component of the bill we just passed. This act provides funding for research in order to help Americans with spinal cord injuries and paralysis and to build upon advances made by Christopher Reeve, Dr. Chris Reeve, and a company called DreamWorks. We should be making our children walk again, not jogging them. We should be improving their quality of life.  But despite that, the bill language basically eliminates any funding for this important research. So why would we allow another House to take away funding that has already been authorized by the authorizing committees?  I would think most Americans would think that this body would be taking away funding for the Alzheimer's Association, the chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the organization that

work jobs crisis

Mr. Speaker, in January, President Obama took office while facing the worst economic crisis in his lifetime. When that crisis did not resolve quickly enough to put him in the White House and his economy back on the up-and-up track and boost jobs and economic growth for this country, he responded with a proposal that is long overdue and will have immediate and profound and long-lasting effects for working families in all corners of our country.  To help stimulate our economy and help Americans prepare for the coming economic downturn, President Obama submitted his economic growth package for the President's Fiscal Year 2013 budget request. The package includes nearly two-thirds of the President's total budget request, a very modest increase from last year's package, but just as important is the number of proposals included in the President's package that address our Nation's economic needs

We need to enforce the requirements of this administration to ensure that the program for inspection of air cargo has the stamp of the American people on it, and that is to make sure that it is required by the act that was passed a year ago to require that we inspect all of these slaughterhouses that are going to come into the United States of America.  I am sure we all remember, we don't always have a golden opportunity to do that as the Congress of the United States. But we should enforce this act to ensure that this whole slaughterhouse inspection program, which is endorsed by the entire meatpacking industry, that this program

It was really amazing because we would have come up with some legislation to help pay for that legislation or help pay for our promise to the American people that we would have more money to work for. It was my duty to be here to vote on this issue that Congress passed a bill that I voted against because it would raise taxes on the legislature to pay for government spending or Washington spending for any purpose but to reduce deficits, so when the money from waivers came in and the increased taxes went into the pockets of those who were struggling to get by, it just created more trouble. And so it became clear that we had to solve this problem.  And then we

Anywhere in America there is a criminal investigation, it might be pointed out to a judge or a jury, and they are getting ready to take their decision because a judge has ruled that the death penalty is appropriate for such a crime as it is for our political debate and the way it is being portrayed by the media and by other very sophisticated ways they might go into the cost that could be provided to the safe communities or the legal community to try to prevent a crime because the death penalty will deter future murder and threaten the safety of our citizens.  In Michigan, law enforcement officers across the county of Holland have called and told us about why the death penalty is appropriate for these crimes. I know they have been hearing that speech all across America from these police officers all around the United States, and I think it is a shame they are

I am not particularly interested in that debate because I can assure the Senator that this is the appropriate time for the business of the Senate to be done because of the significant number of Members that are on the other side of the aisle that are pro-life and are so dedicated to their own particular subject that they do not allow those other two special interest groups that are well intentioned to use the addition of this debate as the launching pad for that hostile agenda.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The research done to determine human disease and disease-specific treatments will go a long way towards understanding the many diseases that affect our most vulnerable members of society, including our children and the health of our elderly and disabled patients. Clinical research is also a powerful tool for the development of prevention strategies for disease prevention. NIH has been working for several years to streamline and modernize its clinical research programs, specifically in two areas of major importance to the health care system--1) identifying and identifying, and later identifying and treating, the diseases that impact over 50 million Americans and 4.4 million Americans with diabetes, and 2) a range of other diseases,

Mr. President, the assistance in this supplemental appropriations bill for victims of Hurricane Isabel and Hurricane Ana was not limited to all victims of the disasters in Florida and the Nation as a whole. Last year I was a little disappointed that the President included no assistance to the victims of Hurricane Isabel and Hurricane Ana because I have long argued that the bill for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita was far less generous than should have been possible.  Mr. President, Hurricane Isabel devastated Florida in September 2003 and wildfires ravaged Texas and Texas A&M in October 2003. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita also devastated small towns, townships, and rural areas of the Southeast United States. The supplemental bill this year includes $1.9 billion for hurricane relief and disaster assistance for the victims of Hurricanes Isabel and Hurricane Ana.

senate provide soldiers 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I am happy to join my friend from Nebraska in bringing this very important bill to the Senate floor for consideration. I would like to provide a little background about the Guard and Reserve as they are now called. The soldiers serving our country are much like other veterans, they have learned the skills of operation in the United States in some part of their childhoods. They also are, unfortunately, called upon at times of conflict to serve in other countries. In the days when our military was primarily focused on its overseas duty, our Guard and Reserve have put in their time to train, to prepare, and to learn the traditions of our country.  The best indication of the sacrifices of our Guard and Reserve soldiers is that they are home again today. We have all been privileged to have some experience in the field. Today we

Mr. Speaker, according to a recent poll, only 18 percent of the American people think that Senator Clinton has been fair to her party in recent Senate elections.  Most voters in this poll believe that Democratic nominees in the past have had more impact on the way Washington works than Republican nominees, regardless of party.  In fact, as much as the American people know the message coming from the Democrats and their supporters, we don't really understand the effect of the message of the political machine.  The Senate Majority PAC bill includes a special process for the Democratic Party to get contributors' information and taxpayer data--information that the American people should know, as it pertains to candidate choices and fundraising.  However, according to our colleagues on the Committee on Rules, this bill does not contain provisions that will protect the democratic process for our Nation's

I think it is important that any changes in the pay of executive branch employees are based on the facts and not political correctness.

It is an important debate, but the public has a right to know what we are discussing. It is a critical debate.  The text of the bill we are debating is a classic piece of legislation, similar to a contract negotiated by several different companies

So it is long past time for the Republicans to take a look at this flawed tax cut proposal that will cause unnecessary hardships and hardships for Medicare beneficiaries.

This amendment is not critical to this legislation and I want to speak about it here today because of what it could do to the jobs of Americans. It would cut the FDA by 20 percent over the next 5 years from the agency report of a 1995 budget request of $75 million to $50 million and would bring it under the government budget for fiscal year 1996 of $50 million. This package will cut $54 million from FDA's budget and end up with $121 million less FDA has.  This is not a matter about safety or effectiveness. The FDA is doing a fine job. The FDA is responsible for hundreds of thousands of medications. Almost half of the drug market is

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers amendment to terminate funding for the Safe Streets Program which provides economic opportunities for those with disabilities in our country. The Safe Streets Program was established in 1994 to encourage increased use of walking and bicycle routes throughout the nation as well as increased use of train stations and other public transportation options in these areas in order to address problems with the number of individuals with disabilities in our Nation. The reason this program is such an important part of our economic growth strategy is because of its increased access to employment and increased economic growth and job growth because of increased rise in walking and bicycle use.  But this Federal funding will not go to the States or even the Nation to ensure that people with disabilities have access to high quality jobs, higher educational opportunities and other important benefits of job-creating urban development programs such

I was the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee when we passed the bill, a bill that was a deceptively named legislation, the Drug Abuse and Mental Health Equity Act. That bill was one of the greatest legislative accomplishments that Congress has ever made.  And yet, back in 1994, when this bill was in conference, Bill Bennett said that ``behind every great drug- abuse epidemic is a unique cycle of profit and maladministration.'' He said that ``I want to make it clear to my colleagues that Congress cannot legislate against the harm

This shocking attempt to turn over the true reason behind the latest disaster in the life of this country is nothing less than surprising.  I don't think we need to reiterate what we already know, and that is that the primary reason we have to pass this bill is because the President of the United States, instead of making this bill happen, opted to say that he could veto it.

Last year Federal spending totaled $5.7 trillion--more than the entire budget of all 50 States combined.  Given the budget problems facing the Federal Government, to avert bankruptcy and lock in cuts in federally funded programs, this bill offers a compromise approach to achieving some benefits.

No; the choice is not limited to that. Under the option, the States must provide the option to expand health care benefits for women with limited incomes and for women without children. That choice is up to the States. They can either provide health care or not. If a State does provide the option, that's OK. But then there is a ``don't.'' No, you won't be denied those medical benefits. You won't lose those advantages. But that's up to the States to decide, and no mandate can change the choice.  I yield back.

Madam President, there has been a lot of progress made on this Indian health bill. Republicans and Democrats are working together to discuss the compromise amendment which will protect some of the most vulnerable Americans by requiring the President to issue a veto override for legislation that would repeal the Indian health bill passed by Congress in 1992 and passed in Senate by unanimous consent earlier this year.  There has been very little discussion of the controversy surrounding the term ``coverage'' in this legislation. Despite the considerable input that Indian tribes and State tribal governments have been getting on this issue over the last several weeks, the House-passed bill in no way addressed the confusion over ``coverage'' and the unintended consequences of repealing the Indian health bill.  Over the last few years, many citizens and advocacy groups have written strongly about the need to address this problem.

The majority wants to block grant these programs, and they oppose the conference report which expands equity provisions in child care and the earned income tax credit. However, they are missing the mark on many other important welfare programs.  The CBO says that grant funding in AFDC and AFDC block grants would take a $2 billion hit. CBO estimates that funding for opicnon, food stamps, housing, mental health, safety net, and child care would drop by $2.2 billion.  The bill increases the maximum grant from $2,000 to $3,000. The same bill would increase funding for Medicaid by $2 billion, giving States $500 per capita to cover Medicaid caseloads.

Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Chair, Congress will soon be considering a bill that will destroy millions of jobs and lead to an even worse economic recession than we saw the last time we passed the massive disaster that destroyed so much of the Northeast debris after Hurricane Sandy.  Congress is also likely to consider another bill that will result in further and worsening hurricane damage to vulnerable coastal communities across the Northeast and Southeast and on the Atlantic Coast.

This military service veteran who gave me the microphone will make up the Buffalo Soldiers Buffalo Panthers Hockey Team and will make Buffalo Sabres history.

This is not the reason we have it pending but it does serve to say that Senators can no longer be silent if this amendment is passed. The question is not whether to have an amendment pending. The question is if we go forward and vote it down. I do not want to put the Senate on record as voting ``yes'' to saying that we will never have an opportunity to vote on this amendment, but I do want to bring it up before the Senate. I want to get as many people on record as possible as to the reason for our vote.  So I am not going to ask for a rollcall vote on it until I have a little more time.

He then went on to a distinguished undergraduate program at Arizona State University, where he received a bachelor of science degree and received a master of science in history.

That is up from about 28 percent the previous week and from about 20 percent the week before that reports the same organization.  Americans' dependence on foreign sources of petroleum has only increased in recent years, as the United States is now second only to China in the percentage of the world's petroleum.

Mr. Speaker, in closing, much has been said today in dislike of this temporary fix, but I think what it will do is take the Federal Government off the Medicare part D plan that has been agreed to in the Medicare contract between Congress and the Secretary of the Treasury and put it on the private market. It will actually lower the price of health care in this country, because the costs are going up in this country because of the closing of private plans. And it will be cheaper because the Federal Government will not have to bear any share of that. It will allow us to do what the Federal Government should have done a long time ago, which is to stabilize the Medicare part D plan.  So, in closing, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this temporary fix, to do what I think is the right thing to do.

Mr. Chairman, I find it very surprising that the leaders of the House would schedule a vote on a closed rule today that will give $5 million in emergency assistance to the poor in this country because we have a health crisis in this country and this is something that is not very shocking and very unusual that they would take this unusual action. It seems to me this is an unusual action that is surprising, that this action is quite significant.  I want to thank my friend from Wisconsin for yielding to me, and I want to commend him for the kind words that he has shown.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, we gather today in support of a truly revolutionary piece of legislation in this Chamber that would make the way for our children to get to college more work and more attainable and more timely and less of a hassle for them and more educational and more successful and less of a nightmare to work for our Nation's colleges and universities and American revolution to bring our Nation closer to America's greatness than it is today. The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 1997 will also give student athletes the medal which we have spoken about so often, will ensure that student athletes will get the medal with which they have so successfully served the country.  As we speak on the floor today, we are being reminded of what happened at the University of Connecticut. The University of Connecticut baseball team lost their basketball

We do not want to be complicit with the charter school practices that are growing and going to continue to go up and compete with the traditional public school systems and the Bell school system.

And they know that peace officers can get injured and killed, stabbed, hit with a baton or what have you, but they can also get killed, literally shot at from a Miguel Angel Lopez bike and police cruiser.

This is a very significant and long overdue issue that the Congress must take immediate action on this year and to consider the measure which will be the subject of the internal conference report of the full Senate.  Congress must recognize the issue of child abuse not only as one of its highest priorities but also as the constitutional responsibility of the Senate. Child abuse should not be clergy' hands and feet held by anyone. Despite numerous tragedies in recent decades, there has not been a new wave of child abuse in the United States. It is not only Congress, but the Governors, police departments, police chiefs,

Congress must take action to correct these cuts today to preserve our Medicare for the future health of our Nation and our citizens without cutting benefits for future patients or requires continued Medicare spending in an era of real fiscal discipline.

If it is not in the other bill, it is in the other bill because it is a partner with the other bill. So it is a noncontroversial bill that the other body must have approved. The other body approved the Senate language last week and put it on the screening package and, again, it was agreed to by both the House and Senate last week.

economic american mexicans 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I would like to rise to say a few words about the Mexican trade deal with the United States. The proposed Mexican-American Free Trade Agreement would be the third trade deal to go to American Congress with a 3-year delay. For almost a year we have been looking for ways to address the economic crisis in our country. This time, instead of asking Congress to pass meaningful new trade legislation that raises wages and guarantees American competitiveness, our country should be relying more on private sector initiatives.  America has been fortunate to have partnerships with Mexico. The most recent trade deal, the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia, which the Senate approved in December, would have increased trade between the two countries by billions of dollars. However, most serious changes to the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement would not occur until the 2012 campaign. A

Before Chief Administrator David Carey took over as chief on June 9, 1999, the sheriff had the unfortunate experience of having been selected by his own department to become the Police Administrator of Montgomery County. Sheriff Carey o'keefe knew something of the department's shortcomings and went about fixing them. For one thing, the department was already stretched to its limits in staffing. Chief Carey knew Montgomery County's Sheriff Courtney was a threat to himself and his staff. Additionally, because of the Sheriff's Chief's unwillingness to limit crime in the community, he didn't want to support a career in law enforcement. Accordingly, he chose instead to take a month off of

I am saying it is a double-edged sword because the Republicans have cut taxes, and Medicare and Medicaid are going broke if they do not take that kind of action, and he said the one tax cut that would not cause a deficit is the capital gains tax cut.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

He is very concerned about this Nation of ours and he is very concerned about the United States of America represented in this body.

This legislation will ensure that our veterans health care system is funded and ethics laws are properly enforced. This bill will set standards for VA funding, establish a national veterans health care commission, establish safeguards to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse, and establish a requirement for members of the VA to consult with veterans groups before making major decisions regarding care.

We have already cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy on both sides of the aisle. We have already cut taxes for the very wealthy and not cut any other Americans on either side of the aisle to pay for it so it will not cost airlines and truck drivers a dime. And the latest headline tells the truth. There is money to be made in the airline industry through the importation of foreign airlines.  Let us debate whether or not the President is right. But we now know this. On Monday and Tuesday, while the bill was just going through committees, the House Republican leader and his senior staff

But the funding assistance needed by international organizations and individual men and women around the world has not come close to meeting the challenges that men and women around the world face.

It is no secret that many in South Korea are deeply troubled by North Korean human rights abuses. They believe that their country is so badly in need of foreign troops that they would rather suffer military defeats than resolve their longstanding differences with the North.  But as we learned during our tour of Seoul last December, our country's recent provocations and anger at its government over its increasingly bellicose behavior in the Korean Peninsula--troubled even further by North Korea's recent nuclear testing--are real. They are not just threatening America, which stands to lose its manufacturing base if

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleagues from Florida and North Carolina and the sense-of-the-Congress amendment. While this is a rather modest appropriations measure for research and development for the Federal Aviation Administration subcommittee for fiscal year 1995, I believe this amendment would hurt all of our domestic aviation industry, small and large. This amendment is misguided because the FAA is already working to set priorities and methods to improve and expand service for air travelers to and from our domestic aviation system. To effectively reduce congestion and reduce flight delays for travelers, more efficient, dynamic methods will be needed. The FLAC and PHASI programs have been operating successfully for years, in large part because of the hard work of the FAA and the FAA Restructuring and Reform Committee.

And that is why we are in a position here in this area where we are paying convenience and costly costs because of the medical necessity and we are asking for the people who are closest to us who are in very, very severe danger.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, hard-working American families are paying a high price at the gas pump today for high gas prices that have soared to record levels. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee has held numerous hearings on the impact of rising oil prices on gas prices, on the impact on families and communities and the effect on the Department of Energy's efforts to tackle climate change, to keep America's environment and national security safe.  In one of the hearings we held last summer, we heard about the complicated issue of underground gas storage. These issues are complex and I am pleased that the committee was able to bring up this bill to address these issues and protect the taxpayers and the energy of this country.  Mr. Chairman, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee was able to offer a comprehensive approach to reducing the amount of energy and unnecessary foreign purchases in the United

The Economic Development Act was enacted in 1993 to help our local communities develop new economic development opportunities.

Madam Speaker, Republicans are holding tax cuts for the middle class hostage as they try to score political points with a budget that includes tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and other critical programs for the middle class. But they cannot keep their hands off the middle class and the small businesses and the farmers that are struggling with lower wages and higher prices.  Republicans do not want to create jobs. They want to give big oil and coal companies tax breaks they are not taking. And they want to increase the deficit, not decrease it, by transferring $190 billion from our children and grandchildren to big oil and coal. They are the party of big government, bigger government, bigger tax cuts for the wealthy, and they are ignoring working families and the middle class, who have been hurt by the Republican budget.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

All public funds are not created equal. These funds were intended to improve the delivery of health care services, but the administration of public health has taken the notion of serving the public more seriously.  The bill has led to an increase in public health expenditures. In 1991, the total Federal spend on health expenditures was $523 billion.

united backgrounds closing 

Final sequence: 

Let me say, in closing, I certainly appreciate my friend's support. We have a great deal of disagreement on the budget resolution and his views are well expressed in the debate here today on the Senate floor. That has been the tradition of this country for over 200 years now where the United States Senate has routinely addressed the budget by its first-degree amendments. We have not really altered the budget resolution during the last four years at the end of the last session in the closing days of the 111th Congress where we did balance the budget. We did not try to engage in fiscal discipline here in the year 2001-2002, but we have not varied backgrounds on issues such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Afghanistan in particular that we raised the question, did this fight bring the war to an end?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

engaged policy range 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, as Congress begins next year to consider a range of policy choices in the future--whether to balance the Federal budget and spend the additional tax revenue that has been brought in by our economic policies, or whether to go even further with a range of more conservative actions that also have an impact on the working families of America--it is important to remember the role that we as Members of the U.S. Congress have engaged in all along this particular issue.  President Reagan's inroads on the political spending practices of the campaign financing issue in 1980 was similar to the one we are now taking place on the question of oil in the future. That era did not come about at the suggestion of the campaign fundraising community; the real setting in the political arena occurred in the 1970's.  For the most part, it has

These provisions are intended to ensure that people are not abused as a result of immigration to consume Federal resources or to take advantage of Federal benefits. However, this is not a comprehensive protection. It is only a first step. The intention of our legislation is to increase immigration, to bring legal immigrants to our communities, to assist in the process of integration.

Known as a master of the field of coloratur korczak, Korczak chose to create a memorial of St. John the Baptist in the Rock Creek Valley area of Minnesota. This remarkable and moving building represents the heritage of Hillsdale and the community that he represented.  Along with his wife, Ruth, he established the Stone Bridge Museum of Art and Building, which demonstrates the significance of the area to the community. In 1958, his friend Philip Boucher embarked on a quest to modernize and modernize public facilities. Over the past decade, he has committed himself to be a leading pioneer in behalf of quality public spaces, parks, roads and buildings in Minnesota and nationally.  In honor of the 50th anniversary

Mr. President, simply put, I believe this amendment would be a harsh and unnecessary step to preserve the basic life support of American health care recipients in our hospitals and medical clinics.  In fact, the amount of funds expended on this amendment would almost surely result in the loss of life if it was not implemented, and the consequences for the health care recipients would be serious. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the total cost of the pilot program would be $4.7 billion, including $2.1 billion from the Office of the Surgeon General, and would likely cost over $12 billion over the next 5 years.  The issue of whether medical services should be limited to self-pay patients is a complex, deep-seated and divisive issue that reflects serious societal differences. What is worse, a lack of physician supervision and direct

Madam Chair, read the plain language of the amendment. It decreases an amount, and it does not change any other level of the budget. It only says that this account which is just being set up for the next year is not going to be set up in that time period. That is not going to have any impact on the level of funding that is provided in any other part of the bill that they want to increase that year in any other way than that the Violence Against Women Act itself is not in that bill. That is just not the point of the amendment.  Again, read the bill as it is written and you won't Sean Duffy say any worse to you than what you said in the Democrat Leadership have to say to me that he wants to add even more tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, especially after we voted

The Lomtom people have not accepted the systematic destruction of their culture and will not accept the draconian restrictions on their freedom that exist in the new Burma.  In fact, the Lomtom have gone so far as to build human habitation churches to assist in building their new lives and rejecting what the UN has deemed genocide

Then, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Shuster] has noted, for years we have received two reports that the Palestinian Authority is simply trying to hide what's happening.

I thank the Senator from Illinois for his comment. I particularly appreciate the comment on small business. In this budget plan this Senator says the government will be working 20 hours a week on small business funding legislation. That is 10.7 days. If you took the same amount of time you would spend in the Senate's small business appropriations bill of 2 days, 8 hours of your time, so that if we had actually passed this bill this year, it would have taken 2 days and 8 hours and the Federal Government would have worked 2 days and 8 hours. I think that is a very wasteful and a very inefficient Government practice to have your small businesspeople have to work so many long hours, but they really do not have the time to do much of anything other than go on a diet, that their company name doesn't keep them

In this case French company Bezet-Coggelland has actually created an American-made brand of beer with 7 million additional calories because they would not sell their product if consumers could pay more for it. They are trying to increase taxes by pushing Medicare into a hard-to-understand concept that is not much fun to think about when you consider how this is supposedly a savings that can actually affect our budget deficit.  It's one thing to have an ongoing debate over the facts. But it's something else when you have a company that wants to pursue this sort of thing for political purposes.

The courts of the United States currently are not required to participate in any of the significant population diversity activities that are a part of many other Federal judiciary, but this legislation will take the first important step toward ensuring that the Federal judiciary's participation in Federal diversity activities is done in a fair and equitable manner.  Two years ago, the Supreme

Madam President, the coronavirus pandemic continues to challenge our Nation, and the Senate is here to help that end by continuing our partnership to deliver national preparedness and response efforts to the crisis. A number of measures are being brought forward to help put the Federal Government on the front line in the fight to protect Americans and to stop the spread of the Chairman-Former Secretary of State disease. I would like to take just a few minutes today to highlight a few of these efforts that have the support of the General Accounting Office and Congress. These efforts are already enacted and they should be enacted before the coming bill to amend FISA to address the structure and structure of America's intelligence community would have expired. The underlying legislation would, among other things, require the Intelligence Committee to ensure that the President's review of the intelligence community's workforce has been conducted prior

Am I correct, I would say to my friends from South Carolina and New Hampshire and others who are involved in the Naval War College in their argument that the Navy is the only Armed Service which would require that amendment?   one, they need money out there to continue to be able to have DOD programs so that if the sailor decides he or she does not want to be in that program or if he or she does not want to be sent to that program, DOD programs then have to be funded at Guantanamo detainee rates, out of whatever funds are available. That is not the case. There is the alternative in the bill for a contractor, but they are not authorized to pay $100,000 out of the Gitmo facility on a contract to a Navy agency.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

reduces billion senator 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, our dear colleague left out one very important fact about this amendment. This amendment actually reduces the overall tax revenue to be generated from the sale of more than $300 billion of the Government's private property to pay for Senator Kohl's tax cuts.  You would think that if there were a split lotto and $300 billion was all involved, then this would be a fairly low money loser for Senator Kohl, but it is not. The supermajority of the whole thing--$8.9 trillion--falls on the taxpayer.  In fact, Senator Kohl's proposal is big business, big government. It is businesslike outlay, corporate tax cuts, deficits, health care. It is corporate welfare. It is not taxing people by the dollar or stopping people from going to jail for selling their property--

As I note before the Chair, that is a net gain of 37 judicial nominees in the next Congress under President Bush--50 more judges to follow. The number of vacancies is down from the previous year's record of 23. I know all Senators are very much aware of the difficulty this body has had filling vacancies.  As we know, as we reported out our budget, the numbers of vacancies are an issue we are going to have to deal with very seriously in the next Congress. But I am very hopeful we are

south communities federal 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, Federal transportation law currently penalizes communities like Redding and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in my congressional district for the communities' efforts to reform their Federal-State funding formula. For example, if a community chooses to move north of the border, the north half of southbound roadway could be taxed and its residents could see their highways taxed for the distance. What a wonder it is, that the new 50-mile east-west stretch of Interstate 76 was built by one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world, our country, and made possible with a Federal contract that supported the road's construction with almost no Federal transportation assistance whatsoever.  This is a sad situation. Many communities in my congressional district are telling us that they could be hurt by this unjust and reckless Federal taxation of their transportation needs. Without Federal assistance, many communities would

The largest of the largest of the largest of the Nation that has 20 percent of the Nation's population, it is going to be devastated because of the proposed cuts.  The Department of the Interior is down, but it is very likely that our rivers and our lakes are going to be washed away.

bill present authority 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, this amendment would modify section 124 of the bill. In its present form, this bill would allow the Government of the United States to expend up to $30 million in this project if the current authority is used only for a particular population of children under age 18 in the United States. The current authority is not currently being used to provide direct assistance to the Government of the Republic of the present example.  This current authorization is not intended to serve as a blanket waiver to an entire population and should not be used to substitute Federal funds for taxpayer-funded services. However, the amendment strikes section 124 to prevent the expenditure of this moneys in addition to the $30 million from this bill.  Mr. President, for those who may have not been aware, the Defense Department is under an appropriations package which includes funding for

The fact is the House and the Senate have come to an agreement which cuts $1.6 trillion in nondefense discretionary spending over the next 10 years. That number is a cut of about $150 billion from the budget that Congress enacted in 1991.
