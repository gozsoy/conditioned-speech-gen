I thank my friend and colleague for the time. Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the Medicare prescription drug benefit legislation in 2002, the total dollar cost to seniors has risen from $5,657 to $6,821 between 2005 and 2013. As a member of the Congressional Committee on Ways and Means, I am also deeply troubled by the increased premium costs of prescription drugs and the costly and arbitrary delays we are facing in the enrollment process. Our committee has reviewed the legislative proposals and found that the bill we have before us, H.R. 707, would go too far and impose unnecessary and unreasonable costs on our Nation's seniors and the taxpayers who fund those costs. H.R. 707 is not the way to solve the problem we face as a nation and I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on

Senator Schumer says he does not remember a Senator ever saying that in his family. That Senator knows how much the Republicans raised. He knows it better than anybody, as has been told here before. But that was on the Republican side, but if he said it on his family, that Senator and his family would be in trouble.

We're trying to help you to do what you need to do. When they see an employer in their community who has already paid them a fair wage for what they put in, that company has said, Why don't you go to the Federal Government and they will put you in their program. That's how we got the budget deficit back into balance. It was built on a $700 billion deficit that was caused by a $700 billion tax

We all agree that the government of China should do more to halt the persecution of those with legitimate grievances. But not only must the government of China be willing to denounce its own government for human rights violations, but it must also demonstrate leadership and take steps to improve the overall human rights situation in China. We must ensure that China is not able to continue to develop its repressive policies or continue to be dependent on its human rights abusers.

Mr. Speaker, Time magazine reported last week that there have been at least 228,000 layoffs in the private sector since the beginning of the year alone. For the last three years, over 60 percent of those that have been laid off have been of nonunionized industries. Why are they laid off so much more than other workers, because they know that if they want to go back to work they will have to work another week before they are entitled to their time back when they have been laid off?  Over in this House of Representatives we have over 50 years of continuing to reward those who do not want to be members of the middle class or the majority or who are not willing to be part of the corporate society and the top one percent of income earners in this country by giving them a break because they do not have enough money to send

Unfortunately, I think we will be unable to do that because we are not going to have the opportunity to have an opportunity to have a debate in that regard before we leave this evening. But we will be trying to come back tomorrow and if we do that I will not have any problem at all if we are able to take it up tomorrow.

Mr. President, the problem with this--and I could support it if it were made clearer--is that it does not have to be true. I do not understand what the problem is with saying that the Federal Government cannot make and enforce rules that apply to all private businesses. The Senate has long recognized that companies don't like regulations. If they disagree with an exemption they don't like, they can complain about the rules themselves.  It is my hope that if the Senator from Pennsylvania is willing to work out this amendment--and I expect he will be--I can bring forward and do that without the problems and complexities that I see with this amendment. I hope that we can work it out. If it works out, it could be important to improve the way that the debate goes forward.  I thank the Chair.   oh, I

Mr. President, I was greatly disappointed by the vote of the Senate last Friday to confirm Judge Michael Cleland to be the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. This was not the type of decision to be made by the senior Senator from Texas who has been so successful in his legal service and in bringing about change in this country as the Vice President of the United States. I am deeply disappointed that this decision did not help change the culture of corruption and public interest which has been so characteristic of this institution for so many years. In this instance, I can understand the rationale behind the recommendation for judicial blockade by this President and the President of the United States. After all, he has already placed so much pressure on the Senate to support this nominee that he has forced through a nomination to the Federal courts of this country to have even less judicial

It was the Department of Justice that first attempted to determine whether the Federal Guard had committed crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  The court of inquiry at the time, as the Senator from Arizona just said, was not the judiciary, but rather the Department of Justice. The judge then found that the claims of these men were meritorious and found that there was evidence in the record of the Department of Justice that the Federal Guard committed crimes against the soldiers and officers. In the end, that was ruled not to be meritorious and has been the standard for all subsequent criminal prosecutions.

Mr. Chairman, the President's request for the President's fiscal year 2006 budget is to increase the deficit by more than $50 billion over the next 10 years. This is simply not in the best interests of our economy and the American people. It is important that we take a look at what the President's budget and what the Republicans in Congress have in mind for this country for the next 5 years before we take our final action in the session and before we leave the House of Representatives in December of this year for the new fiscal year. This is just the beginning of what we must do in this Congress to balance our budget in 5 years and in our time in this great country.  I do not know what the President's new plan is for the next 5 years. I would have

Despite the long tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump will claim a place among the most secretive Presidents in American history and on the heels of a major tax audit. That audit revealed that Donald Trump would be likely to hold more taxes in his name than any President before him.  Over 2,000 documents reveal the details of Donald Trump's finances and the disclosure process that has been plagued by secrecy, confusion, waste, and abuse. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to bring out details of the President's tax return and raise public scrutiny about his withholding or disclosing of any income that would be subject to taxation.

First, let's take a look at the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, one key bill that Christopher and Dana have spearheaded with the partnership of private citizens and nonprofit organizations all across the country. They have brought together organizations of all sorts--research organizations, foundations, and other individuals who also care for others and participate in research all across the country that are concerned about this very important issue of people with spinal cord injuries and for our overall public health and safety needs. It does not have to be this way, I think. And it just happens to be that when we did this legislation that they presented us, the Congressional Accountability Act, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 302-61, the patient safety bill that they sponsored and the Senator from Massachusetts has led on.

Mr. President, data has become a form of currency. Today, businesses and government are processing approximately $1 billion in payments per month to foreign customers for electronic services. At the same time, people have adjusted to the increased cost of financial services and economic growth as a result of lower interest rates and globalization. In fact, China is now considered to be the largest economy in the world. This boom has created jobs that are generated largely in the information sector of the economy. But a key point to understanding why many corporations are moving to China is the lack of enforcement on compliance with the World Trade Organization in the U.S. and why many are moving their operations to China instead of the U.S. And so today I am introducing Senator Lincoln as an original cosponsor to legislation that will strengthen the enforcement of U.S. antid

The toll program was created as an option to attract businesses to the Capital and its industrial and industrial-sensitive areas of the Nation.

Mr. President, the Bible tells us that ``Greater love than this has no man than to lay his life on the line for his friends and for his country.'' In all of the human drama of the struggle to bring about the end of a century of tyranny and injustice in the Middle East, we have had to draw in many of our most faithful of Americans and even some of the most religious and the least tolerant of the world. But no matter how strong the resolve of individual Americans might be in this difficult time of uncertain world conditions, the fact is that the world will endure if we do not take the courageous and the principled steps to bring about an end to the stupendous toll of tyranny and exploitation that has brought about its collapse.  We see this failure to end the tyranny of Saddam Hussein and the brutal oppression that continue

I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I sat and listened to the debate earlier on the question of the spending for the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan for the last 6 years and did not like that spending and did not want to send our troops into harm's way.  This bill would authorize a supplemental that contains more funds for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and, of course, the Secretary of Defense will be given authority to provide these additional funds in the future. We are concerned with the issue of funds for support of our troops, but it is hard to have the consent of the Congress to make this much money available. That is why I wanted to offer an amendment to allow additional funds, specifically for defense programs in Iraq and Afghanistan to be provided if and when that funding is approved by the Congress.

We should know the votes in less than 15 or 15 minutes. I would like to move to table those for 15 minutes for debate on both sides. We can accommodate some who are having a great time with their families on their way home this evening. At least there are some more time to be allocated for that purpose than was the case this morning. And I am ready to work with the leader to try to get that worked out in a way that allows for a greater amount of debate on both sides and also the important other side of the issue of terrorism and the day-to-day American citizens as well as the many other citizens of this great country that the leader is talking about

Madam President, I rise today to mark a truly important day for my State, and the Nation. Today marks the 20th year of the State Fair of New Mexico. It is truly a proud day to celebrate a great celebration and a very important event in our State. It is one that I have always enjoyed, as my wife did when we were first married and her father and husband came in a couple of years ago and went out and very excitedly did New Mexicans want to see. And now we all know what a great time they had there and it made a big impression on our children and our grandkids as they grow up.  We saw a very proud parade this year from all over the State of New Mexico. It was amazing to see thousands of children going through the parade and all the fun things they are going to

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is vital for the future of our Nation's military services and the Nation's troops and their families, and that is the funding for VA health care services. It has been more than a year since the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs reported a VA health care bill to the floor with a very positive overall health care bill for our Nation's veterans, yet not much is being done to get VA health care done properly, and, in particular, how it is getting done for our servicemembers and their families. With Congress having not even completed the VA health care reform bill last year, we have now only half of the year to actually enact the VA health care bill that would deal with VA health care needs for our Nation's veterans and their families.

Mr. President, the assistance in this supplemental appropriations bill for victims of Hurricane Isabel and Hurricane Jeanne is a measure that honors the lives and the efforts of all of those who perished in the early hours of this year's devastating hurricanes. I am pleased that this legislation provides a contribution to the relief efforts that have already been made. I strongly support the bill and urge my colleagues to support it.  While I am pleased the bill provides funding for hurricane victims, the statistics certainly do not bear out this belief. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, nearly 3,700 people died in the gulf region alone--more than one hurricane death per day--with most of those fatalities occurring during Hurricane Isabel. While nearly 90 percent of victims reported working at least part-time, flooding destroyed homes, damaged or destroyed hospitals, homes, roads, churches,

We wanted to make sure that when the President takes office next year that we were not spending more than we took in.  As I said earlier in my remarks, it was our intention to reduce the budget deficit in this year alone by over $100 billion. Yet the White House has not done it. We are still borrowing more than we spend for this year.  This puts us in the situation of having to increase the interest payments on this country's debt. I ask the Senator and my colleagues, What do you think the Senate should do to keep from defaulting on our obligations and facing the consequences of the lack of fiscal discipline by the Congress and the

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to speak today on the important yet vital importance of comprehensive criminal justice reform. As I said today when I offered the amendment to the current balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States that calls for a substantial reduction in spending and opportunities for more investment in criminal justice and law enforcement, I am concerned that, for too long, Federal criminal prosecutions have been a multibillion dollar luxury for the rich and powerful. In my view, a reduction in Federal prosecutions would encourage States to reduce their prison capacity by 20 percent, as they would become more effective at enhancing justice in State court and local prisons.  These reductions in Federal criminal prosecutions will help to fill our overcrowded prisons. I believe that Congress must now reevaluate its role in this legislation to ensure that the value of Federal criminal

Well, I thank my colleague, Mr. Garamendi of California. We're both Californians. What this will do is allow the miners to come into this country and fill out that Social Security number and apply for work permits so they can make a living and not pay a State tax rate of more than 19 percent of their income. That does not mean anything to anybody in California because I do not want to say that this is a hardship for anybody. But if they are able to come to the United States and work in this country, their taxes will go down as a result of what this will do.  The reason it is a hardship to me and many other people is because we have to meet the same obligations to our children and our grandchildren that we do to them in this country.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one other comment on the compensation criteria, which is that in the bill as currently written the Commission would have jurisdiction over certain securities in small companies with $100 million or less assets that are important to the public. It would not have jurisdiction on any capital activities in this bill except for the sale of small companies at a profit and for securities held in escrow with not less than 25 percent of the amount of such securities held in escrow being controlled by the Commission or the Commission acting by a majority vote of the Commission members under Chairman Domenici.  So the Commission would have jurisdiction only for capital in small companies with less than $100 million assets.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare health plans called cost contracts. Under legislation I introduced earlier this year to provide Medicare beneficiaries with the same health care options that Medicare Part A and Part B currently provide, both in managed care and through a traditional fee-for-service fee-for-service program in the form of a prescription drug benefit--the Do-Not-Call List and Medi-Cal--over 200 States have approved the payment and distribution of this program under Medicare. The President in Congress has also recognized the significant value of the cost contract system by directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work with Medicare to determine the best way to administer the program and determine the benefits that it delivers. There are currently over 24,000 hospitals in the United States with cost contracts that operate under the laws and regulations under Medicare.

I think the polls are showing that the Republican proposal to cut Medicare in order to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthiest would only result in the loss of Medicare for 4 million people or possibly 6 million people if you are referring to the projections of a Congressional Budget Office, but that is a fact that the public has had to deal with for years. The polls show that that would cause a big cut in Medicare for those Medicare beneficiaries.  aaaAnd who are the beneficiaries?  The women of America. The elderly in America.  Medicare, a system that had a marvelous success story. What is it doing?  It is benefiting the very wealthy who are paying very little in taxes. That is not right. They are paying substantial tax, but the consequence is that Medicare is a program that has paid out over $

This legislation is based on several excellent proposals that have been recommended by this body and will promote support for many Americans in considering their current sexual orientation and any changes that might result.

If the answer to that question is yes, they are eligible for coverage. If the answer to that question is no, they would not. I think the answer to that question is yes for health insurance.

Studies have found that doctors do not follow medical guidelines in terms of how to care for people with serious illnesses, and ultimately hurt patients in the process. The most extreme examples involve caesarean section deliveries, hospital stays, and caesarean sections. The children of survivors of child birth are suffering because medical liability insurance companies' medical liability insurance policies have become so burdensome. The largest of these insurers is American Medical Services, AMS. Between 2000 and 2004, the total payments attributable to medical malpractice insurance totaled $28 billion. That is $28 billion that the American taxpayers are subsidizing. The total payment awards to the States alone amounted to $290 million, and that would cost the State of Mississippi over $100 million in payments each year

Mr. Speaker, I rise to second the thought that the Speaker just made on the Speaker's rules debate. We must change the rules. We must reform the rules because the rule that we have before us today should be rejected and a new rule would be adopted to bring this problem to a quick and bipartisan solution.  The problem has always been that the Rules Committee has no real authority to raise money to fight this problem. To the public we know that there are problems in our schools, in our rural areas and in our urban areas. But we do not have the ability to control how much money we spend on these problems with the power of the purse and the desire of Members to be able to be involved. We have the power of the purse and we have the ability to do the right thing for our kids and our future.

So the way to get that done is to take up the money and be ready for it in the next week or so when we have additional appropriations on it for people who are working now to get welfare off the Federal Government and into the hands of people that are willing to work and provide those people with something that they need that they have always paid for in the past and ought to be able to get back to do today, get off of welfare. That is how this welfare bill, if it goes forward, has to go forward. It is what we have been talking about for months now.  This amendment is about benefits, benefits that are an offset.

The Republicans can disagree about how to make ends meet, but they're willing to work together in a bipartisan way to do it.

Mr. Speaker, S. 1789 as passed by the Senate on February 7, provides for relatively minor adjustments in the use and financing of veterans health care programs. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and urge my colleagues to support the conference report before us.  It is not a complete plan and my amendment provides for only minor adjustments to VA programs to meet the requirements of this act. I have personally visited veterans medical centers to find out the real effects of this Act and to experience the important needs of our veterans. I believe these are the real problems the Veterans Administration needs to address.  The key issue facing veterans health care today is not treatment or cost but insurance protection for the millions of veterans receiving health care. This bill contains the first significant reform to the veterans health care program in several decades. In my view, the savings will

Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from Alaska. I think he makes an important point in terms of the way this would work if the United States Government is the buyer of the commodity or the ``sole buyer'' of the commodity. We make the offer and we get the $100 million so that we can make this process work. It certainly makes it work when it is the buyer of the product. But as I understand the proposal here, if we are the sole buyer and the price is for $100 million, then it really could result in a $30 million--not necessarily on an average basis, but we could have $30 million in a case where the price is for $100 million, and then if there are efforts by the Department of Defense to, perhaps, attempt to reduce the price because of environmental concerns,

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 31, the United States imported 1,527,000 barrels of oil every day from Saudi Arabia. Last week's oil was up 3 percent from the same week a year ago. On January 31, the United States imported 764,000 barrels of oil from Saudi Arabia--the largest daily increase in more than a year. We import much more oil from Saudi Arabia than we do from the United States in any given month and all of these changes point to the greater need for increased domestic production in this country. The reports also make clear that the Middle East is beginning to affect global oil markets and that OPEC and non-OPEC producers are beginning to work in concert. OPEC's current production cut is already having an impact on gas prices and petroleum futures markets.

Mr. President, I will go into this amendment in more depth after the Senator from New York has the time. I think it is very important to understand where this amendment is coming from. It is a vote on whether or not we are going to take the actions we have already taken in the area of the housing program for veterans with respect to housing that is so vital to housing for our veterans, as well as our housing needs for our veterans in general in terms of cost to the Federal Government and Federal housing construction costs that this program will create for our veterans in the next 5 years and beyond. This amendment will prevent the local and State governments in which we have our housing and there are many that support this program from having to pick up this additional $40 million in existing funding in their budget for the benefit of our veterans.

As I travel the State of Arizona and the Nation, I often have people and people with Mexican heritage that stand on the frontlines of economic disaster, and they do not hear much debate about it. But they are doing some great work in the area of jobs and economic growth in America.  The agricultural industry employs more than 23 million Americans and generates more than $3.5 trillion in GDP. It supports nearly 23 percent of all private-sector employment in the United States and is a key driver of innovation.

The Department of Defense is not a business with its own independent budget; it needs resources and contracts to do its job. The purpose of the current CTA program is to enhance the military readiness of our Nation and build a partner for other industries to make their goods and services more competitive in the global marketplace. This program will provide a well-deserved savings to taxpayers over the course of 10 years. The President has asked Congress to fully fund the CTA program as it was originally designed.

Bush at the State of the Union Address to present a letter to the Congress of the United States asking the Congress to support the President's request for the use of the new Armed Forces of the United States to assist in the war on terror. In that address the President also asked for assistance in the building of support for our efforts in Afghanistan as well as assistance in the war on terrorism.  It is important to understand the political situation in Afghanistan now that we have taken the opportunity to exercise our responsibility in Iraq. The plan and our proposed actions in Afghanistan have caused us to put our policy in a new and tough setting. We have to make this decision before we leave and before we are able to transition to what is going to be a very difficult transition in the post

Reclaiming my time, that is only the point I want to make. I am not suggesting that it is not important to the very least point of the bill that we go to other agencies that will be affected by this bill and take those agencies out of the private sector and take them out of a very important tool for making sure that people have a chance to make sure that they can come to the United States if they want to do business with those other private business enterprises that have an interest and are going to be successful in those things because they are going to be so beneficial for them to do so. We need to go after those agencies that are responsible for those things. But if you can basically say to every private enterprise that has an interest that is going to be helpful or is going to be successful in those things and take them out

Mr. President, on May 26, President Clinton made the difficult and courageous decision to renew the MFN program for China on the basis of the recommendation of the Clinton administration that the United States should renew the policy that it had enacted last year in that program. I agree with that decision and believe that it is imperative that the United States be able to continue to promote and encourage the reform of China. A major challenge for the United States and the world as a whole is the continued policy of China that is based on an unending search for the commodity of influence and the one simple measure that would be seen as part of that broader strategy is the renewal of the MFN policy for China.  I have been greatly concerned about the way that China has approached the reform of its trade policy, and I believe that the renewal of MFN is

Madam President, today I wish to highlight the 100-year history of the Triangle Cooperative Service Agency at the University of California, Berkeley.  The Cooperative Service Agency was created to promote cooperative relationships among regional regional institutions. This important agency also provides vital services to other researchers in all of the different parts of the country. This organization is a vital program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and its mission is to advance the diversity of interests in agriculture and food production in the United States. In addition to its significant academic contribution, the cooperative agricultural service brings the knowledge of agriculture to communities throughout the world through its cooperative efforts. The cooperative service also develops cutting-edge agricultural research and development through the educational and vocational benefits it provides. This success has created a lasting legacy for agricultural programs in the California Department of Agricultural Research and Extension and through the

We are confronted with a very serious proposal that would create an even more hostile environment for the American consumer as our economy remains stuck in a clear, terrible pit of recession and uncertainty. The Democrat leadership has presented a bill that would inject every resource and every imaginable Democrat-made bill into the war against American energy production. And as it turns out, all of those resources are desperately needed by a Democrat President and a Democratic Congress.  The Democratic bill would place all regulations on the citizens of America--regulations that would create market forces that force American industry to invest and create jobs here at home rather than putting high-priced permits onto our constituents and shipping jobs overseas.

The 1997 goal for reducing the deficit is an achievable goal that will be achieved by all efforts to reform the welfare system and that cannot be accomplished without a commitment by the Congress to provide this commitment at the appropriate time and level of funding necessary to achieve the goal.  I hope the Senator will be supportive of the amendment.  The  secondly, I say to the Senator from Michigan that I think there is some merit in the approach that he has taken. I have talked to the subcommittee chairman about that matter, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds, and the Department of Labor.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask our nation to honor the ultimate sacrifice made by our brave Americans in service to the Nation and to pay a special tribute to Ambassador Frank Keranich and our Nation in Korea. Frank's service to this country demonstrates what kind of nation our Nation is and the sacrifices that our service personnel make in the defense of our freedom. Frank was tragically killed by enemy fire while serving his country in Korea.  In 1993, Admiral McKeon recommended the Navy permanently elevate Frank's grave to the U.S. national cemetery in Springfield, Virginia. The Nation's great unquestioned military history and our military values continue to guide our military, especially our national security personnel, today.  Frank, in his absence, helped show the courage that is a tribute to our Armed Forces. Admiral Keranich

Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman would continue to yield, this is not a medical procedure that is given to the American people to help them understand health care costs and medical care and medicine or have it pay for itself. It is not a price you pay on your insurance that goes to help you pay for medical care if you have a preexisting condition. This is purely a benefit that is paid for out of the taxes of the American people.  To suggest the application of this is the only way that we are going to fix health care and increase our ability to control the costs of health care is simply not the way it should be.   tests called for by the Weldon bill allow the Bureau of Labor Statistics to develop the current rules for calculating costs for any proposed premium tax or tax increases that would otherwise be assessed on health

Mr. Chairman, hard-working American families are paying a high price at the gas pump today because of high energy costs and because of the failure of Congress to protect our energy supply at the expense of our national security. The Government must now regulate natural gas prices, allow drilling for oil and help lower the cost of gas for all Americans. Unfortunately, H.R. 1325 does nothing to help lower the cost of gas for our citizens, just the opposite, this bill does.  Mr. Chairman, in the last Congress, Congress appropriated billions of dollars for the authorization of oil-shale drilling on federal land and Indian lands. However, the authorization expired in 2007. Now, the law requires that production be authorized by December 10, 2009, and by April 1, 2010. If Congress passes H.R. 1325 and fails

We believe that the Federal Government should not be able to take your tax money and to give it to the Secretary of the Treasury in order to spend it and to borrow it and to spend it and then give it to the United States military and to spend it in other countries or not pay your taxes at all. We believe that the American people should be able to keep more of their own money and use it for their own interests and not be able to control what this Government does or does not do for them.

The gentleman's amendment would cut $2 million from the Office of Policy and Program and $2 million from the Office of Financial Management and would authorize a reduction in the percentage of funds provided to financial institutions to provide emergency spending.  The gentleman from Ohio has previously stated that he is not interested in earmarking funds for any kind of benefit for civil and human rights, but now he makes it very clear that the means of emergency spending is his preference.  I am certainly interested in seeing the full spectrum of our Federal tax base and how it is invested. This amendment is very clear that the Federal Government does not provide any funds in this program or any other program to assist in nonhumanitarian assistance and to interfere with the ability of the most vulnerable in our society to obtain proper humanitarian aid.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, a lot of progress has been made. We are doing extremely well. I think it is good that we are here because we are not there yet to get this done. We are going to get there as quickly as we can, and we have a majority in the Senate. If it is right for the Democratic leader to speak to that possibility and that Senator in his turn, who was here earlier, maybe we will move ahead without Senators missing votes because we lost a couple earlier so we would not have that threat, if he would be willing to make some kind of agreement to make it right for all Members of the Senate to start voting today. That is one way I believe we would move forward with the debate. I hope we could find a way that we would have unanimous consent to bring this bill to the floor.

Because I have consistently come to the floor to say that the more money the Government collects from the American people, the more power we will have to control and direct that money back to our States and our local communities and, in some cases, our States and local governments that are in the crosshairs now in the recent election and in all of our campaigns over the last 2

Madam Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal from the White House is a reverse Robin Hood Program for poor people who need Medicaid, not a Robin Hood Program for the wealthy.  It is estimated that 20 million Americans will gain coverage under this new Medicaid plan. It does not repeal our health care safety net program which provides financial assistance for those who are uninsured or underinsured. Instead, it says that poor people will get health insurance, but the rich will get more.  Madam Speaker, we have too many Americans who have lost their lives to preventable causes, and we have more uninsured children and poor seniors than ever before. We have a crisis on our hands and our priorities need to be reversed.

Born in the town of Lemmonzisko, near Warsaw in 1908, Ziolkowski was raised in a Lutheran-Catholic family, where he attended the University of Warsaw and the Warsaw School of Fine Arts. His later career included sculptures in the Los Angeles Museum of Modern Art and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Chicago Art Institute in Chicago.

Mr. President, simply put, I believe this amendment would be a harsh and unnecessary step in the opposite direction of the arguments that we have made in this amendment to make sure that American families can enjoy the life that is available to them when they have medical savings accounts.  By saying that children and working families can no longer participate in employer-sponsored plans that are providing employer-sponsored health insurance, we will be saying that if an employer cannot provide health insurance for its employees, they are going to have to pay for it by turning their employees away or charging their employees a higher premium. In short, this will end up charging the parent more to have health care coverage, by, in effect, penalizing the parent. I think, therefore, it is the wrong course of action, and I respectfully oppose it.  The <|endoftext|>

That is what the Weldon-Cardin-Crapo amendment does, it does that as a way to get at the problem and this problem that is going on at the local level.

The state of East Timor was further ravaged last month by the country's government when the parliament allowed a new security cabinet to occupy its offices and appointed its new military chief to lead a government whose rights to govern and the press are severely restricted. This week the European Union and the United States continue to provide assistance to a fragile democracy in the troubled region that had hoped for a better future and that was working well enough for its people to be able to vote with their feet in the presidential election and to choose their own leader.

I didn't say there was a lump sum. I said the facts are the benefits of both plans are the same or better in the long run for the taxpayers and the worker than for the government in the long run. And the fact is that the more money there is in the government-run insurance pool for a job in the long run, the better it is for the workers and the taxpayers and the overall economy. This is also true for HMOs because the workers in these plans have more in terms of control over their health care costs than in other parts of the private sector where they are able to leave and go find a different plan and actually get better care for their health care costs that has some savings to the Federal Government in terms of making the overall cost of health care more affordable and the benefits for the workers in terms

Mr. Speaker, it is easy to tell where President Bush's priorities lie when you look at his budget proposal. The budget increases funding for programs that will benefit veterans health care, infrastructure investment and education, while reducing spending on energy.  Mr. Speaker, veterans' health care is an issue that is critical to the economic health of this country. As recently as May, VA Secretary Robert Gates stated that the VA's health care system remains our top priority. These findings come from a Government Accountability Office report. While the VA has enjoyed some impressive performance and we are proud of their recent achievements, the system remains incredibly broken and needs to be rebuilt. As we make more difficult financial decisions, I urge Members of Congress to continue to fight to reform our outdated health care system.

Their mission was to bring the House of Representatives and the people of this Nation into the face of a Nation that was indifferent to any man or woman fighting for it. To send troops to a small corner of Europe was to sacrifice the lives of American citizens. Yet the thousands of brave and courageous Americans that were sent and some that did not were greeted by the swift and easy withdrawal of the first British army from Normandy. The largest ever British army ever sent by the British Empire was come to a point where it was not even known where it was on the ground.

Mr. Speaker, it's been said that the French drink champagne only when they're happy or they're hungry and the American people have a problem with the French Federal tax credit for low income seniors or seniors whose income falls below $40,000 a year.

I appreciate the response of the Senator from Hawaii, and I do not want to raise the Senator's personal issue with him, but this is what he said. That is why we have to get some action taken on that issue before this particular legislation becomes law. And I think the Senator is right that Senator Graham from Florida has been asked to take up the issue of whether this bill should be passed without the way we do it will harm our troops, will affect our military readiness, and we need to ask ourselves if we are so concerned that we cannot pass it because of it. In fact, it appears that there is a reluctance to make it clear that we are not concerned about the personnel on the ground on the installation of nuclear weapons in that area of the world to protect our Nation and that this legislation would affect them adversely.

We can see the risks of the economic crisis that the Republicans are trying to avert here in the Senate and in the House and the White House.  We see a failure to put Americans back to work and to rebuild our economy. When we passed legislation that the majority leader and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate supported saying we would give tax cuts to those who have the least ability to pay for it, it did not make sense. Tax cuts for the 1 percent are not a way to rebuild our economy and get our economy back on track. Tax cuts for the 1 percent do not make sense when most Americans can't pay for it. Tax cuts for the 1 percent are not jobs. Tax cuts for the 1 percent do not create jobs.

Mr. President, it is not my intent tonight to keep the Senate here for a night or a weekend or whatever the case may be as to when I will be coming to the floor and making my request that we are doing just the opposite of what I feel I need to do tonight because I don't want to go over my time this evening and go over the schedule that has been set up by this Congress in order to get an election done on November 8, and also that the Republicans have set up on the House side and the Senate side in order to accomplish a number of things. I think we have the legislative agenda, as I have indicated to the distinguished majority leader and to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has the time on this side, now to get this job done. I think the tax bill has to go down because

Madam Speaker, I have good news this morning. Low-income children in D.C. are a giant success story in the U.S. House of Representatives. Last night, the House passed the Neighborhood Stabilization Act that reopens the Neighborhood Stabilization Program for the people in our inner cities across our country to help them live within their means and not be pushed out of their neighborhoods due to the unfair nature of the District government's policies. The Neighborhood Stabilization Program will reallocate money from government spending to a new program called the Low Income Homeownership Program to help more than 25,000 low- and moderate-income families buy a home in their own neighborhoods in the District of Columbia. This legislation is going to bring nearly 6,000 families who now are in a catch-22 because the District government has turned the Neighborhood

Mr. President, if my colleague wants to proceed a little longer, this is a very important issue that is very important to some of my colleagues. It is very important to me as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. It is also important to the Senate of the United States and to the people of this country who have been patient in waiting for some time in some cases to have their rights to be heard by the Supreme Court recognized in an appropriate manner on this particular matter. That means that it means that they cannot go to any other court to get any more assistance and perhaps to have any other procedures they might need to continue to carry on their lives if they cannot use the trial of their case to have some final relief for them or to have some other relief for them because they have been waiting too long now for some time and they have

Mr. President, I would note that we have approved, first, 100 in the 17 months I have been here. There is no reason we should not be able to do this again in the next 4 or 5 years. That is why we have a lot of Members that were here before us that have signed this agreement, that have signed up with the Republican leadership and Senators in the House and Senate. We are not concerned about moving ahead with a 1-year amendment or a 2-year amendment or a 3-year amendment or a 5-year amendment. We have the 11 original bills that have been adopted. They will not be adopted any time soon, but they give us the means to immediately move forward with some of these measures and get them enacted in the next few months.  I note that after the chairman said he had been

Mr. Speaker, Federal transportation law currently penalizes communities like Redding and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in my congressional district when Federal Transit Administration funds are used to contract for local bus lines and other transportation services. Such local communities are not the only ones that have been affected by the 1996 FTA bill and the Department of Transportation's investigation of their obligations under the 1996 bus route reform legislation. In fact, this matter is well documented and I will not go through the details because this debate is too important to be limited to the past.  I am reminded of the quote by former U.S. Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Smith from North Carolina, to which I have responded in the past. He said that many of us have decided to follow what he was suggesting, and there is no better proof of the importance of our running the country like the

Mr. President, the proposed cuts we are talking about will devastate Indian country. They strike at programs that help ensure that the people in Indian country are able to continue to maintain their culture and to survive as a nation in its difficult times. Cutting these vital services will cut off benefits to 70 percent of those over the age of 65 that have so much to lose if the country is to keep its culture strong and the communities strong.  In the course of my efforts to help some of the thousands of Indian families in Alaska that are in need of vital health and dental services, the State of Alaska was a site I worked with a long time ago when I created an Indian health fair and it is a sight we all take delight in. Last year in Seattle, Alaska, it was my pleasure to take part in an attempt to open a center

Mr. President, this amendment would modify section 124 of the bill. In its present form, the bill contains authority to allow for the transportation of from one location to another at no cost to the United States of the significant expense of one State to another State. The Department of Transportation estimated that the total cost of this transportation would be at least $18 billion a year as a whole. This would take it to more than $50 billion per year as a whole if this is implemented, and it would take it to well over $100 billion per year if this is implemented only in the one State that is currently used to allow for the transportation of these products.  The Senate has given the Department of Transportation very significant authority to regulate this transportation of such items as used fuel in this country of the United States and others which are subject to the

Mr. President, let me indicate with respect to the question of reconciliation being used for this purpose, if it is used for that purpose, there will be some potential that when we are done here we can have the House vote on that bill which will then be filed with the Senate and then the House will vote on the Senate bill.  But if the understanding is that we can just simply have the bill to be filed with the Senate and the House will vote on it without further action or discussion there is the possibility of a change in the terms of the continuing resolution, if that is not the case, we will have to deal with this as a matter of reconciliation, that being the bill filed in the House, and with the House to take it up.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe the 100th anniversary of Muir Woods National Recreation Area in the State of Idaho, a forest reserve that was established in the early 1900s by the Federal Government. Muir Woods was the first national recreation area in Idaho and was home to many of Idaho's history, a tradition that continues today to this day. Although the forest area is still managed and operated by the Forest Service as part of the National Forest System, the Federal Government, the local land managers, and many private citizens still pay the bill to maintain and maintain the area and its many significant natural and cultural resources. In addition to providing over 500 miles of hiking trails throughout the forest area in northern Idaho and the San Francisco Peaks Wilderness in California, this territory has the deepest concentrations of bald and gray wolves anywhere in the country.

Madam President, I applaud the work of Chairman Dodd on this issue, as on so many others this year and in previous years. His efforts have made the Dodd-Kennedy language in the CJS bill the most successful legislation this Senate has ever approved.  I do have some serious concerns about the language in the bill that is now before the Senate. The bill before the Senate would dramatically cut the $1.1 billion in funds that the Department of Defense will get each year in this way of providing its soldiers with the equipment and training necessary to meet the unique military missions they will face in Iraq and Afghanistan.  This bill would also give $4 billion to the Department of Homeland Security to use for new police and firefighting equipment, $1 billion more than the administration is recommending for this program in the President's fiscal year 2005

I would first like to thank Congressman Ileana for the introduction of the National Security Officers Memorial Act on a bipartisan basis in the House of Representatives last Friday and for leading the effort to have this bill brought to the House floor for an up-or-down vote on final passage earlier this week. The supporters of the bill have worked hard to find a bipartisan way to pay tribute to this exceptional American patriot and to honor the memory of his most dedicated and dedicated public servant, retired North Korea Ambassador Lee Young-Chul.  In particular I would like to take this opportunity to thank Congressman Ileana for her leadership on this issue and particularly

Mr. Speaker, this Republican bill has gutted the Community Health Center Program and is not in the public interest.   homophobic slur; obscene remark; profanity; sexually explicit language; shameless promotion of homosexuality, violence against children.

I would like to thank Chairman Simpson for his leadership and subcommittee chairman and subcommittee staff for their work on this bill.  The State Department appropriations bill is a good bill for the people of the United States of America. This is a great bill for the State Department and for the people of Iraq. This bill was debated and passed in the Armed Services Committee by voice vote. And while the military is still under a military draft, the National Guard and reserve components are able to take part in the military and receive the military training and life-long support that they need. Army Reservists and Guard Members, many of whom serve in the gulf region, will benefit from this funding.  So it is important for the United States to have a strong U.
