waited senator bill 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the bill before us today is a simple, one-page bill that Senator Vitter is well familiar with. He has served on that committee for years and years and years. I have waited 10 years to come down here and call for cloture on this bill. If this is a bipartisan bill, I hope that is the case.  I yield the floor.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, this week we are being asked to decide whether women should be allowed to go to work in certain States and have the same protections that other Americans have in their private lives based upon their birth certificates or whether they should have to depend on one big Federal bureaucracy to decide whether their decisions are legitimate and, in fact, every woman's.  Again, the Federal Government has gone down this path for its own political gain. The Federal Government got to decide who got pregnant in order to fund wars and other unnecessary military spending for its own partisan agenda.  Madam Speaker, it seems like it doesn't really matter how many African Americans, women

We said we are going to let drug manufacturers do their job of covering that, and that has worked tremendously well.

Now that is irresponsible.  Now, we have to pass a new resolution of the debt ceiling before this year to do that. We have been ignoring that, and we are not doing it today

Madam President, this week the Senate is expected to vote on President Bush's budget proposal for health care reform. I have long been a leader on the issue of health care reform and believe that we must move this plan forward and that meeting our obligations on people's health insurance should be a top priority. I support getting better health care solutions and have seen firsthand the damage this system can cause for those who have health insurance.  Recently I found out that one-third of all Americans without health insurance did not have access to the kind of preventive care recommended by the Mayo Clinic, a group that I support.

This is a disaster bill that will not only help the victims, but will also give a sense of national unity to the people of America.  First, it is a disaster. Now, first of all, what it does is it provides some relief for the victims of the hurricane. It provides

Madam President, before we close the debate on this issue, Senator Leahy brought up the issue of the Johnson-Wee amendment which the Senator from Minnesota agreed to back in the full Senate. In the statement to the contrary on the previous question to address that issue, the Senator from Minnesota misstated the nature of that amendment. It was not an amendment at all, it was an amendment to the minimum wage that would increase the eligibility threshold to work minimum wage by one percentage point to $2.13 an hour. And what was the reaction of the majority to that? The majority voted to deny the amendment.  But then the Senator from Maryland

The question is: Will President Obama or this President, if he wins this election, immediately sign tax increases that will add to the national debt and be sure to greatly increase the deficit?
