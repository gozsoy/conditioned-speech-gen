They faced an unfair standard that amounted to a prohibition on grain exports. The reason corn farmers suffered was because they were short on corn.  The lack of grains has contributed to the corn market weakening, as has the price of corn. Farmers cannot manufacture corn because of the enormous price they have been having to pay for grain.

The American people are watching us and they are saying: Are we going to stand for them when we are being taken advantage of by a wealthy special interest who cannot be held accountable? Do we want to be the person who says to the American people, look at what we are doing in the other body, then they are going to vote for us in this body because we have kept their promise to the American people that their money

Mr. President, first let me say I take no responsibility for Senator Feingold not receiving the amendments he had originally requested and not being able to proceed to his amendment so he could make his own position heard. I have no further requests for time on this amendment so I would simply say that he made it very clear on a number of issues to the time limit he set to be able to do that. So I would simply say that was not my consideration.  Mr. President, I would be pleased to withdraw the amendment if there was a difference of opinion with regard to my having said he could not complete his amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I will take a few minutes to say one thing to the American people that is a part of the defense budget. That is that we have cut back to a budget that Congress enacted 3 years ago. We passed the bill and we appropriated it, and that was 3 years ago. We never promised to cut back. We just never promised that we would not cut.  So, as I indicated, we have never expected to cut it. But if we are cutting it in a way that is impacting our small businesses and the manufacturers that create the products we use in our home areas, we do not expect to come back to Congress and

I think the Senator from Maryland and the chairman and the ranking member of the committee had taken a lot of time to work with the other body and our friends on the other side of the aisle on this and had a lot of productive discussions with people on our side who were not on the Senate side but had expressed concern and were aware of the issues that were before us. And so there were people who were not willing to be cooperative in terms of their efforts to get this legislation to the floor that

This means that Americans are going to work more and save more for their retirement, and they are going to work less and save less for their children.

He has set it aside and said that it is time to have a conference between the Democratic leader and President Clinton on this matter. It is time for him to say that he wants to be ready to move this bill to final passage but he does not want to say at the same time that it should be delayed even further in order to avoid this conference. That is what this is about. It is about having a vote in the Senate on something that is an important issue but not in the sense that the administration is looking for a legislative move to get it done.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for legislation to protect women from unwanted sexual contact. Our Government has made tremendous strides in allowing for greater opportunities for women to succeed in their lives by ensuring that they have the same rights and opportunities as every other American woman. However, that progress is not complete because we continue to let too many women down. Our justice system is still lacking in women's rights, and women continue to be subjected to violence, harassment and sexual assault in our society. This is especially problematic when it comes to consent and trustworthiness of an adult man in an intimate relationship. I have no doubt that we can ensure more

We know that it was not the original purpose of this amendment to apply the Constitution to the original American States that we chose to call ours. But the right of equal protection under the law must be a given of every citizen to do what they think is right under the Constitution so long as the Federal Government does not interfere with that right or that right of any individual in any way. That is not just one right but all of them and every one of them can have that

Mr. Speaker, a couple of days ago there was a report in the New York Times that an energy firm in my State recently offered a utility that had previously been awarded a contract for 17 percent of all of New York's power to drill for oil in the gulf of Mexico and to then work with their foremen to put those supplies back where they were before the exploration and development program was established in the early 1980s. Now it is possible to get that made up and sell it for $35 million in California and California can continue to be the largest energy producer in the world

Madam Speaker, yesterday morning the House made history by passing the Medicare Modernization Act of 2007 by a vote of 286-98. This bill includes important reforms to our Nation's Medicare system, the most significant in 30 years. Today we vote on an important part of that reform.  The Republicans voted for a $5 billion cut to the health care of seniors while the Democrats voted to increase funding for the health care programs and increase the number of preventive care centers in our health care system. Democrats oppose this plan and have offered an amendment to the budget agreement that will block this spending from becoming law.  We must work toward making the Affordable Care Act

It also doubles the Medicare entitlement and increases our indebtedness in the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries.

The current Clean Water Act allows States to enter into a regional grant program that enables them to acquire permits to move hazardous materials, such as sewage and heavy metals from dangerous sites to safe sites around the country. But the EPA program and its permits have come under a legal and practical problem because the EPA originally stated the program only applies to within one State. The proposed waivers for the Florida

This left the Congressional Budget Office with no choice but to cut funding for the Agriculture bill by $12 million, which they needed to avoid a potentially disastrous government shutdown.

People need to be allowed to come and go as they see fit and there needs to be a process to have people evaluated on the merits before they are granted access to our country. The last administration did an incredible job of doing that with the Iraqi security force and now this administration should do the same with them because it has a better grasp of security and better capabilities.  There has been a lot of new information that has come out recently that challenges

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Energy and Water Development appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2006 and, most importantly, to commend Speaker Gingrich and the House for their bold leadership in addressing the crisis facing our country's energy infrastructure. We have an energy infrastructure that is falling apart. The Congressional Budget Office projects that we could be facing another long-term shutdown this winter unless we make significant progress on fixing the Nation's energy infrastructure. While the Energy and Water Development conference report keeps the Senate bill focused on real solutions to our energy infrastructure, it continues to throw out unnecessary and politically incorrect ideas that I think are just plain bad policy, too.

The bill that passed on May 31 required Senators to vote to amend the bill or risk the bill failing to receive a vote on its final passage.  There were questions on what would happen to part B in the Medicare bill if this provision, which the amendment would have required Members to vote to amend, would come to the floor. Republicans argued that the amendment was necessary because the law allows the agency to stop participating in the part B drug benefit if it determines that its savings would exceed the reimbursement to

Mr. Speaker, this House has a lifeblood of American values, and those values should never be compromised on this floor, and I stand here today as a cochairman of a group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. They want to remind us all that American public health is also just as important as American national security.  We have to ask ourselves, though, what has gone wrong on this side of the aisle? Do they really care about the American people? As a matter of fact, what we are seeing is the exact opposite of that.  Yesterday, I spent an hour and a half listening to the Special Council for

There is no better example of this than the Maine Digital Corporation Act which passed the House on August 28, 2003. The Maine Digital Corporation Act is called Maine Health Care Credit Act because it is a 6-year project to reduce the size of the Maine Health Care System by nearly one-quarter of its current size and use Massachusetts-based technology to finance research and development of new forms of medical care.

Senator Murray has been a leader on prison labor issues for many years. In fact, the amendment she and I offered in this body--I believe she and I joined, actually--goes far beyond the narrow standard of what is considered in a Federal prison labor bill.

He told the people who were listening to him that they would need more than a year to get a budget that would balance and pass the Senate, and then a year later they would have to get it passed and that it would have to be paid for.
