I thank my friend and colleague for the time. Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the Clinton tax bill in 1993, the economy has gone from under 1 percent growth to more than 7 percent growth. The Clinton tax bill has created nearly a $3 trillion budget deficit because it passed legislation that shut the small business tax loophole that Republicans claimed to want to close. The average American has seen their income taxes go up about 6 percent over the last 6 years, and the additional $300 billion that is going to be collected from Americans by this is going to be spent on tax breaks for millionaires.  Now, it has been claimed that this bill is about cutting the deficit. I would just point out that the fact that this is the last bill before we adjourn is, by itself, a little misleading because in addition to this closing of the small

We just debated last week the bill, a $100 billion tax cut package, which reduced taxes on over $100 billion worth of savings for individuals and for families. We offered an overdue $1.3 trillion deficit reduction package for economic growth, targeted spending to help spur private sector job creation and help protect the most vulnerable in our society.  At the same time, we have made real cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, to our environment, to our veterans, and to education. We have

Strikingly, the PRO Act would destroy employee privacy rights by requiring employers to give away employee information to a government agency to enforce one of the Government's laws without even paying the employees if they so choose. And that is all these employees could get if the Government had its way and destroyed employees' private rights to privacy and employee information for its own purposes and for the Federal Government and employees paid to enforce that Government law for them and their employees paid jobs for them if that government law required that information to be made public or that the Government must pay the employees for it if it so chose if that Government law could be economy in its own right.

But I would like to restate for the benefit of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that $11.9 billion, the average subsidy that taxpayers are paying now for these people, is more than they are paying on the war in Iraq for reconstruction today.

Right now, there are 52 percent of our Federal workers who are going on furlough. They are furloughed as well as people who are doing benefits

The McCollum amendment would ensure that oil companies don't get this taxpayer subsidy as they drive American families to depend on foreign oil for decades. The amendment would strengthen Federal oversight of oil companies' profits, to ensure that taxpayers have confidence that the companies are doing the right thing in allocating their profits.

It has been argued today that Senator Specter and Senator Jeffords and others were not involved in this program when President Bush initially initiated this program and President Clinton was in the White House. So it has been suggested that this legislation is being introduced because of the administration and the Department of Justice action.

This bill, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) has outlined, represents a good opportunity for the Congress to spend resources wisely and responsibly. I urge the Republican majority to adopt these provisions on the House floor immediately and repeal the provisions they disapprove of as they expire on April 7.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, the President's request for these funds would certainly be on the level of what President Clinton has asked for and the level the previous Republican budget request had for this particular program, but this would not only be a time we should be making decisions but this is what we should be doing here in Congress because the Congress needs to act to get this important program started. We need to stop wasting taxpayer money.  This process that we have gone through in the Budget Committee should not last a moment. It should be followed with action here in Congress.

Despite the long tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump refused to disclose any of his tax returns during the campaign, as he has refused to release all of his tax returns since he was first elected to the American Presidency. After a complaint about his refusal was filed with the Treasury Department, President Trump decided not to respond to our request for documents in response to objection to that. That is a surprising and troubling decision given his previous efforts to keep tax returns and campaign finances a secret.  We have also learned, as I have before, that there is a precedent for such withholding of tax returns. The President of the United States can withhold tax returns from Congress during hearings, and the White House withheld the President's taxes from Congress during his nomination hearings. In fact, the Supreme Court refused to hear the

Yet, for nearly 20 years, the Federal Government has been prohibited from requiring service providers to create a public/private sector partnership to enhance government services.

Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Sanders' objection and amendment. Massachusetts is home to the only two military hospitals in the United States of America that are focused on the treatment and support of veterans in this region of the world. So it makes no sense to deny veterans access to health care services when they are so desperately needed and deserve it the most.  VA VA Medical Center Med vouchers allow patients in VA medical centers to utilize VA medical services, which are funded through VA medical research grants. NIH and VA Medical Centers each charge different per capita levels. Yet the Veterans Health Administration cannot reimburse a veteran for a same-day delivery or within 24 hours.  Without the vouchers, a VA hospital might face the problem of having to charge veterans higher costs for a care that has already been performed. This can actually be detrimental to VA.

Mr. President, the Bible tells us that ``Greater love than this has no man than this is to lay his life upon the line to take it from the hand of his God.'' Today I rise to speak about the sacrifice of the Bible's authors and of the community of nations to rise up and sacrifice in the name of their great leaders of the world in greater numbers than ever before. The great gift that the Almighty promised to our ancestors is for an age to come when Americans will rise up in remembrance of the ways of the Scriptures of liberty, justice, and equality that prevailed from the dawn of recorded history until the American patriots captivated the entrails of Malachi Malachi Ezekiel Malachi Ezekiel Malachi Ezekiel Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi Malachi tane

I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I sat and listened to the Senator from Texas talk about this amendment and the other amendments and what is going on here in this bill. In fact, the administration asked for these waivers just last month as a condition to expand all of Secretary Perry's grant programs for the Bush administration. That was to authorize these programs so that the administration would outline the sorts of abuses it was going to find in those grant programs that would actually be used. The President has made it quite clear that he wants his administration to use taxpayer dollars as a lobbying tool. We can all agree that lobbying is not appropriate, but here we are about $200 million in the hole.  What is interesting, the administration submitted a waiver request for these grants for the Department of Agriculture's food safety and protection

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is moving expeditiously on H.R. 3246, a bill that I introduced earlier this year to require a trade adjustment assistance program of the United States. I believe that this bill is an important step toward helping those workers and businesses in the United States who are not in the process of moving to export-oriented countries to obtain new business and new jobs. This bill also reflects Senate legislative action which passed unanimously during the Senate Appropriations Committee markup and which is now House Speaker Pelosi's priority.  The so-called NAFTA section of this bill covers only the U.S.-Mexico sector of the world's free trade system and also includes services to U.S. goods which the U.S. Government negotiates. However, if the trade adjustment assistance program has its benefits achieved by workers and businesses with different export

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5656, the Global Food Security Act of 1997.  There is growing concern over the threat that the provision of food aid will pose to the future security of the United States and other nations that support the United Nations mission in the countries of the world and to the world community as a whole. But these actions should be the first act when it comes to the question of increased food security for all people and particularly for those least fortunate in the world today. I want to take just one moment today to say that we cannot die when food security matters. There can be no doubt that the huge economic and humanitarian disaster in Iraq, Iran and other parts of the world is a tragic embarrassment for all people.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is considering H.R. 1836, the Amagansett National Forest Boundary Adjustment Act of 2007. This legislation does a remarkable amount to resolve two outstanding issues in the Alachua-Brock and Amagansett National Forests in my congressional district of Florida and in the Interior-State Land Grant Colleges in South Florida.  This legislation resolves several technical land claims in the refuge, the largest of the three land claims. The Amagansett National Forest encompasses the entirety of the eastern Florida Cape and will yield approximately 6.5 acres to the cove-dependent Cove Island Park Branch and Cove Island Beach Branch Cove Island subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision subdivision montauk

Madam President, I rise today to mark a truly important day for my State, and the entire Nation. On Tuesday the State of Montana finally received the Federal recognition that many States simply have not received in the past. I am very proud that Montana will now be the ninth State in the Nation to receive this brave recognition from the U.S. Congress.  On June 26, 1994, Montana first filed for the recognition of this special honor when President Clinton signed the Alpha Epsilon Pi Livery--ATA--Reciprocity Act into law. This legislation recognizes the extraordinary accomplishments of each and every young man and woman in Montana, who has made exceptional contributions to their States through an educational and work experience. This law will help States like Montana further recognize the contributions that their students have made by becoming accredited by ASU. The Association

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is vital for the future of the Second District of Missouri. Across this Nation, thousands of teachers have been suffering the effects of the recession since the early 1990s. According to recent studies done by the National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], a study that studies education outcomes in disease, disability, and school, teachers in my State of Missouri have lost more than 23,000 teaching jobs since the beginning of the 2001 school year and more than 19,000 clinical education jobs. Over a period of time, more than 9,000 clinical education positions have been created across NIH, the National Institute for Health Research [NINR], and other Federal agencies. The increasing downsizing of Federal agencies has had profound effects on the salaries and wages of qualified teachers throughout the country.

Mr. President, the assistance in this supplemental appropriations bill for victims of Hurricane Isabel and for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is a bill that should be fully funded for the coming year. So it is time for the Appropriations Committee to address a problem that continues to plague this country and that has continued to plague all of us since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged both coasts of our country. Hurricane Isabel brought wildfires across our country and in several instances to our own area. The county of Palm Beach County in Florida has lost some of its timber.  With a total loss of timber from wildfires in the past 25 years in the Florida Everglades, the need for these dollars to be repaid as quickly as possible is certainly warranted. But with this issue we cannot ignore that there are still wildfires in our area, in some cases over 100

Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. The amendment establishes bad policy. It would give so much power to the States over the education of children in the country that that power would be turned over to the States and that it would serve a lot of different purposes. The first is that it would give the State the kind of privilege that we have not had for 20 years because we have had so many special interest groups working to restrict the education of children. That is why we are trying to stop this amendment. It has absolutely no educational benefit. The Government should not be using a Federal tax dollar to promote State control over our children. It is a bad idea.  Another effect of this amendment, I do not know how many times I will hear some college professor say that, ``We are going to help get education available

In the past 15 months since the Republicans took control of this House in January 1993, the Federal Government has been shut down 27 times.

Mr. Speaker, let me just say that it is no wonder, then, that the women's rights movement is supporting the so-called Pelosi bill. What Pelosi wants to do in the House and the Senate is to turn the Speaker into a force for social justice, a force for women's rights, a force for equal rights, and of course it will turn the Senate over to the right of women to vote. That is the way the liberal leadership has brought the bill forward and association, the political ties of the left that we have.  What the Pelosi bill is proposing is to do away with the 20-hour work week and take over the entire paycheck.  The world is a far better place because women have the right to work as hard as men do.  The Pelosi bill says we cannot allow a Republican Congress to turn our backs

Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare health plans called cost contracts. Under legislation I have introduced legislation that provides us with this opportunity, the Congress would re-examine the bill to ensure that seniors can continue to join these plans without any government intervention and that President Clinton could sign that legislation into law.  All I ask in this vote is to allow Americans to use their Medicare benefits on a whole host of other plans and to allow the Federal Government to participate in these plans if they truly want to. There is no doubt about that. The question is whether there will be a day when we will get to the bottom of this fraud and abuse that has been going on in our Medicare plans and whether we will be allowed to provide the confidence that we need to continue to help our seniors plan for their health. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from California is correct. There are a lot of good items in this bill that I support. But to say we are going to extend some tax credits for small businesses and other kinds of businesses is an important addition because in California alone, it is estimated that small businesses employ some 24 million people in this country and they pay all of these taxes for us as well as others such as our children and other items in the bill.  So the idea of increasing the rate of 20 percent would probably not be the best one for us to use because it would benefit fewer of the people who are working than HIV-AIDS causes, is it not?  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2631. Today, about 76 percent of seniors in the United States receive care from Medicare or Medicaid and around 85 percent of Medicare coverage is through private coverage. The fact of the matter is that seniors have not received the care they have come to expect from government since the President passed his Medicare prescription drug benefit in 1965. Congress has an opportunity today to help seniors with a bill that increases the financial benefits of the government to the Speaker's most senior Members of this body.  We believe the President's program is much more than a gimmick or gimmick that will draw new revenue into the Medicare trust fund.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to second the thought that the Speaker just made on the very serious matter of Congress having the power to pass legislation to deal with this problem of government waste and fraud and abuse. This Speaker will not entertain the notion that we can solve a problem like this by passing legislation. The legislation we have passed, a bill that is bipartisan, that has broad support, would deal with the regulation of the auto industry by the Federal Government. I believe that we can not have the law being twisted around in a way that would mean that there would not be market demand or there would be not only a decline in the sale of the automobile. I think that is wrong.  I think the gentleman is right on one point. There are important differences in this issue, but, in my view, they are not as important

Mr. President, Senator Dole has pulled down the welfare bill and, therefore, the amendments that we would like to offer today have been withdrawn to save some time and to clear the way for more work to get done on that bill.  In the case of the Dole amendment No. 2425 offered by Senator Dole and Senator Clinton on education Federal funds will no longer be available to public school districts for tuition, books, and supplies. In addition, the number of students eligible for Pell Grants will be reduced from $4,600 to $2,700.  We are going to do more work in the next few weeks and the next few months.

I support this legislation because it provides the transparency, legitimacy, and protection our federal agencies should give to all Members of Congress.  Under current law, Congress receives information electronically, and we must file electronically in order to receive information electronically. But databases accessible electronically can contain sensitive information. Access databases stored online can contain data searchable only within one location, like a workbook or database, and can contain sensitive information about congressional meetings. Because access databases are required to be kept secret from unauthorized readers, Congress must maintain the privacy of those records, secrets that criminals may misuse to prey on Capitol Hill sleight Madame/keeneriey of offices in District E or H.S. and on hard-working Capitol Hill constituents.

Mr. Speaker, S. 1789 as passed by the Senate on February 7, provides for relatively small adjustments to an existing system of requiring that these school districts adopt procedures to permit the superintendent to convey properties on and along school property lines in order to construct rehabilitation of public buildings and schools which have been damaged by fire or flood. The legislation also proposes that these facilities constructed or damaged by fire or flood need not be replaced and are only affected by repairs which are designed to improve bridges, highways, parking facilities, public buildings, playgrounds, recreational facilities, and the like.  Under current law, if a school district does not establish procedures to permit the superintendent to give a title deed to a private property line, the local school district must have an exchange or cash payment in lieu thereof and in order to receive funds from the school district, the superintendent

Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from Alaska. I think he makes an important point when he says this legislation does not go too far because it does not prohibit the use of economic sanctions if it is necessary to prevent a specific use of a weapon of mass destruction or if it makes a difference in the circumstances of the specific use of the weapon of mass destruction or any of the other circumstances under which the United States can do so if it is required to do so because we do not use this process in most cases because of objections to any such use of weapons of mass destruction. But I say to the Senator, it does, in fact, not go far enough because it also allows for preemption of executive actions by States which do not impose sanctions under this bill.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 31, the United States imported 631,000 barrels of oil each day, 523,000 barrels less than the 629,000 barrels imported during the same week a year ago.  Americans relied on foreign oil for 52 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf oil embargo in the summer of 2003, the United States obtained about 45 percent of its petroleum needs from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the summer of 2003, foreign oil accounted for only about 35 percent of the United States Government reports that foreign countries used to obtain petroleum for domestic consumption.

The Supreme Court judges are persons of many races and classes, and their opinions have broad appeal because they represent the people of America. Their opinions may not be a sacred rule or the wisdom of the land; but they can be considered constitutional, and that is what we should do.  In our current system of Government, we have a perfect example of this idea: the fundamental role of judges as constitutional officers.

Mr. Speaker, according to Medicare trustees, that program requires an immediate 51 percent cut, a significant reduction in Medicare spending by the year 2031. That is unacceptable and the Medicare system requires no more health care reforms than it has before. We need not change that system as we have made a great deal of progress, but our deficit on that subject should be limited, because our Nation cannot afford not to do any such things.  It is that outlook in our own deficit policy that has led us to accept $1.5 trillion in cuts, imposing about 50 percent in tax cuts. That has caused, if you consider the preceding matters in terms of health care, to a 6-percent reduction in spending in fiscal year 1996.

And I would just like to add to what she said and bring up a statement that she made at our Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing earlier this week that Chairman Upton has been pointing out and saying that a lot of the Members here who have taken this plane ride to North Carolina and flew over the beautiful mountains, we really haven't noticed any new coal plants on our backs because of where they have been built. It is a costly habit, a waste of money. We want to get the power out from this dangerous ground.

Mr. President, I will go into this amendment in more depth after the Senator from New Mexico has finished with it. But I want to give some basic points. As the senior Senator from New Mexico just said, the Affordable Care Act is in its early stages of construction and it has had a tremendous impact on the quality of life for the American people and on the ability of these small businesses to compete in this global economy that we have to create an opportunity for them to be successful and special.  I have two things to say to this: No. 1, there are a lot of reasons that people are opposed to the bill. There are some things that I find off-putting about this bill. There are a lot of things that I think that are fundamentally wrong with the bill, some of which, as I said,

What the amendment seeks to do is to make sure that every person who makes a profit is not able to make a profit on any of the investment and that the other 10 percent of the capital gains that might be made is not half of the capital gains that might be made to these individuals because they would not be able to take those 10 percent out of the profits that they make to the extent that they could make them on the order of 20 percent, 20 percent of the capital gains for a small business investor.

The simple truth of the matter is that many Americans are more worried about tax increases than spending cuts or economic growth than they are about the growing number of Americans who have had their government- alligators bitten by a number of individuals and a number of different approaches that are now being proposed to keep that number from increasing much more than it already is at this point compared to its previous administration.  Well, if we look at what the middle class is doing right now, a decrease of roughly 400,000 people has occurred, and in this economy the working poor still account for about half of the American economy. The growth rate is just about flat.

Mr. President, Richard Dudman, one of our Nation's most esteemed journalists, passed away at his home on August 13, 2006 in Louisiana. Richard was the third American Pulitzer Prize winner to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Born on August 26, 1942, in O'Bannon, LA, Richard attended Catholic schools before dropping out in his sophomore year at McNeese State University. He later worked in Los Angeles as a stockboy and as a registered nurse in Stockton and Santa Clarita, CA. He went on to graduate from the University of California at Berkeley as an assistant editor with a bachelor's degree in journalism. He was a three-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize.  The first Pulitzer Prize for journalism was given in 1930 to W. Bernard Dever, who for a period of time published a ``everyday crime''

Mr. President, on May 26, President Clinton made the difficult and courageous decision to renew the security assistance program to Egypt for the next 4 years and renew the technical assistance program to Egypt for the next 3 years. I supported the President in this move and appreciate his efforts to expand Egypt's economic development to the benefit of all its people and all its neighbors and the world and China and Russia as well. But when I reflect on the policy made by the Clinton administration and the bill vetoed by the House on May 19, I am deeply troubled by the consequences of continuing to support the defense of Israel and the continuation of this program. It is my understanding that the administration was planning to provide technical assistance to Egypt to upgrade its missile defense system and ships and development of a plutonium reprocessing reactor as well as assist in that effort.

Madam President, today I wish to highlight the 100-year history of the Triangle Cooperative Service Agency and highlight the contributions that it has made to the agricultural and agricultural related industries of the country.  The Triangle Cooperative Service Agency was created in 1888 by agricultural and grain growers who were responding to strong market demand for farm products from California and New Jersey. Today, it is a member of the New York Cooperative System, serves the State of South Carolina, and has a focus on national food and livestock production through the programs of research and the marketing of products for the food and fiber market.  The Triangle Cooperative Service Agency, known for many years as the Dole Cooperative Service Agency in the 1940's and 1950's, came to represent the strength and potential of the New York State agricultural community.

There has been the assertion that the best way to help parents and children is through child care. However, if we want to say that helping parents is better than support for children who have no support at all, then we should all agree that this is not a job for Congress.

I understand the benefits that the Maritime Security Program will bring to the United States. It will cost no money, and thus reduce the cost of national defense so that we can remain competitive in maritime trade with our Asian and European allies. We do not expect that this program will eliminate port security as such, because this was intended to be a National Maritime Security Program for a time of increased port security and because grain transportation is a significant part of the national economy in Montana, and in the State of Utah and throughout our Nation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In my district in the San Joaquin Valley it has been particularly hard for families and businesses in these areas to get gas for many of the natural gas jobs they were promised at some point in the future.  No matter where one lives or how many gas stations one likes to go to, someone will tell you that their $3.50 a gallon gas comes with a $1.85-an-hour gas tax.  These taxes are a direct hit on small businesses, an hourly hit on employees, and a family tax hit on their bottom line. This is not a tax cut, this is a tax hike.  Now the numbers are devastating.

Mr. Chairman, last March I was in Israel and talked to mothers and fathers who were telling their fathers to give their children as much as they can to save the lives of their children. When they give their children as much as they can to save the lives of their children, they are not just taking from the children but they are taking from the future of their children because they may have to march in four wars in order to achieve their goals. What does that mean to the American family? When we take for granted the obligations our parents have to pay for the expired benefits of our children, to take that away from our children and those children are not benefiting from that.  It is that sense of obligation that motivates me as a legislator to support the Collins amendment. Mr. Chairman, we cannot have a society based on the

Madam Chair, this amendment reflects a simple principle. The government does not and should not protect children and that is a fundamental right that all Americans should have. I believe America's children need to be protected by the government when they are in harm's way and need to be protected in order to protect them. This amendment would protect these same rights for any parent who knowingly gives their own children away to an individual or group that is providing the bulk of that individual's income for purposes that are not related to securing a weapon of war or the prevention of war. That is what the amendment does.  We know what is happening. As of 2009, there were 1.5 million children kidnapped by their own families, abducted and separated from their families and then killed.

The first term of the current consumer protection agency was a significant milestone in the United States Government's efforts to protect children. However, given the importance of improving safety standards for products and practices on the world market, the CPSC should not be the sole legislative tool in dealing with the issue of child safety in America. Fortunately, a compromise compromise was reached to the needs of America's children. In January, the House Appropriations Committee marked up the CPSC bill for conference with the Senate. While this conference agreement has left some shortcomings in its consideration, it represents a very fine example of congressional cooperation with the commerce department to ensure the best possible product for America's children.

If I may reclaim my time and wind down and finish my remarks, there are many families who are deeply in debt, and in fact all Members of this House who vote for tax cuts and who support them make their life very difficult and often very difficult because they find that their friends and their allies on the other side of the aisle run up enormous debt for the very good reason that they believe that they are making the right choice for the overwhelming majority of American families when they pass this measure and put a stop to the practice of going to great lengths to take out the good in their local economy to finish the job that they have begun or to sustain a recent recession.  In my view, there is much more to this measure than just a bunch of hardworking families who find it easier and easier, hard working people in this country

Madam Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal from the White House is a reverse Robin Hood program. For too many families today Medicaid is not enough for health care in this country. It is too expensive and poor quality. It is all or nothing.  Even with the new policies contained in this bill, my neighbors in east-central Florida, families like the Martins' and Campaneros' we have heard from, have serious challenges accessing medical care. They can now get the help they need but need to do so after just the first month.  Medicare, Medicaid are wrong. And for good reason. The Hyde amendment is a prohibition on any Federal funds being used to implement or administer any Medicaid expansion program which expands the Federal option to not cover health care services for a certain number of individuals but cover them only at the individual level

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Over 75 percent of America does not have the insurance that they would like. We have some that have much more health care in which they can actually pay the bills and be in a position to be more productive in life and achieve the things they want to do. We are not going to consume all of our own money for the things we want to do or we are going to just do them all and give the government a good deal for doing them for us or not doing them for them but process all of the government programs through the structure and have them within the context of the free enterprise system that background employees earn is sufficient.

Mr. President, simply put, I believe this amendment would be a harsh and unnecessary step in what should be a bipartisan effort to provide much-needed American medical care. If this amendment is to be successful, the States would have to do more than work with the Food and Drug Administration to work with the insurance companies to establish a medical care insurance trust fund that would be so much the lifeblood of the very foundation upon which our national health care system would be built. All we are asking is that those who would be responsible to the taxpayers be responsible to the States, and that we not use this excessive and unnecessary trigger in the program.  Let me underscore what I said in response to the Finance Committee's inquiry. There is nothing in the legislation which would prevent the States from moving forward. We can absolutely do so.

By the way, our colleagues are saying, let's go to a Canadian-style system, something that is supposed to provide affordable care for all Americans, and let's take health care away from the American people, which we know is going to happen if we don't do what we need to do for our patients here and for our doctors here waiting to see them.

Mr. Speaker, when the Senate considered this legislation, that body adopted an amendment offered by Senator Santorum to ensure that States would be allowed to enact regulations if they determine that the regulations will not result in the loss of jobs for their residents and would not have a negative impact on their economies. That amendment is the text of which we are taking up today.  The issue of where we take the role of the Congress in regard to regulations before they are issued and not able to face even the light of scrutiny by the courts is one that I think is extremely important. There is no law that the courts have imposed on any State with penalties for a regulatory act and no legal authority that the States have for either authorising or prohibiting that regulation. So where are the guidelines or guidance for the States on a legislatively enacted measure?  Last year

Human rights groups such as Amnesty International and the Amnesty International-Bangladesh task force have criticized the Burmese military for using fear and violence as a political tool and rightly rejected the call for withdrawal of military forces.  I am concerned that the scale of the violence--I understand that it was 75 times what Amnesty International said was the case--at that moment might well have been fatal.

All of this development has given our soldiers and our President a chance to look as if we have the support of the Nation in Bosnia. But we have not been doing our job in Bosnia with the Rwanda genocide. The Clinton administration's aid has continued to flow to both sides of the conflict in Rwanda with our relations with other foreign allies on the Continent only deteriorating.  Under this administration, there has been an effort to exert international leadership on Rwanda, but this is un-American.

No health care plan for the poor that costs $500 billion and which cuts funding for most domestic priorities to reduce the deficit will be allowed in the House of Representatives. It will be a welfare program that more and more of the Nation's families are no longer able to depend on that will put more energy and medical services into the hands of working Americans, a program that does little more to make the hard-working Americans in this country with the core elements of success in the housing market, for example, or to support the needs of the labor force.

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to read a sentence from the gentleman's proposal that is in the bill that has already been sent to the chairman of the subcommittee in his attempt to change it so that the No Child Left Behind would be significantly improved so that the best days for the least children are now long gone. This reading of Mr. Delahunt's amendment seems to me to be particularly misleading. First of all, it is not in title III of the bill; it is section 213 in the title IV of the bill. It is $56 million over 5 years. It is in title III of the bill that the No Child Left Behind budget proposal would be substantially improved. It is not in title IV. It is in the same section.

There are certain services Medicare offers, which ought to be there, as other kinds of services which have been there for decades; but there are some things in Medicare that ought to be there for the future.

Mr. Speaker, it's been said that the French drink champagne only when they're happy or very wealthy and if Americans who want to do the same should pay the French a reasonable price for their success. We should pay even lower prices for those Americans who want to put Medicare at risk to restore or improve Medicare.  Both Democrats and Republicans said that they supported the Medicare Preservation Act.  When you look at what they're doing now, that's a real, tangible victory. We can't afford to hurt our seniors or to pay their premiums or any other price for our success with Medicare.  One reason is because the current bill is an emergency bill with a failed program. Medicare will not survive if the original bill continues to exist. A plan such as this must be evaluated individually and performed in a manner that can be managed with confidence.

I appreciate the response of the Senator from Hawaii, and I do not want to hear him say that these Republican Senators did not push for this proposal. In fact, they all voted for it because they did not support a proposal that was similar to the proposal that we have before us today. So I think that response is totally inappropriate to make at this time in our continuing dialog about welfare reform.

Mr. Speaker, we are all familiar with the hundreds of millions of dollars in favors from the big oil companies, but it is even more notable that the big oil companies also received favors from the Speaker of the House and the minority leader of the House in 1993 when he attempted to block the public release of the House Ethics Committee report on the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Despite the previous speaker's criticism of the House as an institution, the majority refused to even hold the closed-door meeting in which the then-Street Street Caucus chairperson, Bob Michel, offered House Republicans a copy of the House Ethics Committee's report on the special treatment of the Speaker.  The Republicans had hoped the rules of the House, which prevent lobbyists from meeting directly with Members of Congress, would prevent members of the Street Caucus from bringing this bill to

There are probably at least a few more that will require some votes and would take a little time to do on the Senate floor than would be necessary to get this tax reform bill moving through the Senate today. But the two most important votes that the Senate should be considering are the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan reauthorization legislation and the renewable fuels standards legislation.

Madam Speaker, I have good news this morning. Low-income children in D.C. are a giant step closer to a House bill that will begin to balance the budget in 7 years. With President Clinton's decision yesterday to accept the cuts in our domestic spending that the House Republican budget bill took too much of on his watch and the first President in a generation to talk about Joe the Plumber on the morning TV show, we all breathed a sigh of relief.  While Republicans were busy complaining about this budget that cuts the services of poor children, this budget will go $15 billion below the spending levels that the President demanded in the first place. Because what the President wants to cut is universal, Medicare, Social Security, and other needs of Americans and their families.  The truth is this budget, as it stands right now, will take Social Security

Mr. Speaker, Federal transportation law currently penalizes communities like Redding and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in my district for not turning on their own streetlights and for not using on-street parking spaces in the communities they govern. Federal transportation law mandates that citizens pay as much as 50 percent of the cost of highways and roads to the Federal Government in this way to promote the further southward expansion of the capacity of Federal infrastructure and investments in our Nation's infrastructure and underfinances.  Ironically, this mandate was developed in the 1980s and mandates that Americans pay in cash, or in better words, the equivalent of 20 percent of the transportation-related costs. The reason for the disparity in tax status for local, State and Federal governments is to promote increased access by private citizens to transportation-related services and investment funds.

They cut education, the health care, the agriculture, the water supply, all of it.  As one of my colleagues from New Mexico pointed out earlier today, this program has not reduced the rate of increase in percent of this population. In fact, education has increased.  They are also pushing for drastic reductions in health care. Native Hawaiians have been threatened with deportation and even turned away from hospitals by the INS. The administration has told them no, because the State of Hawaii does not cooperate with INS in its efforts to deal with medical purposes.  These cuts will devastate our citizens of Indian Country, and that is what we are up

Mr. President, this amendment would modify section 124 of the bill. In its present form the amendment would remove a significant tax loophole that is present in the bill but is not required by law and which allows international banks to avoid the underwriting standards in the bill as they do in the United States.  The Bank and National Association of State and Local Authority Banks own half of the banks in this country. Because they own half of the banks, this means that they own some of the rules as the Act directs, some of the performance standards, and many of the collection practices that are not always required by law. This amendment would remove this circumstance.  The amendment's authors believe that the amendment is necessary in order to facilitate sound macroeconomic policymaking and stability in this country.
