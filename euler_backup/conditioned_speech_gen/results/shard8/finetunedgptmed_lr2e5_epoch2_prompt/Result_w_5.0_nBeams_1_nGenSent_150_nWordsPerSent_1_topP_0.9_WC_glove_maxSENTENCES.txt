Let me ask the question further, if I might retain my right to the floor, and I will do it now. Is it the view of this majority that legislation which limits benefits is a limited use of the government's resources if it is in the interest of the American people? The answer is yes. Is it the view of the majority that legislation which increases the minimum wage is another limited use of the government's resources if it is in the interest of the American people?  Is the majority willing to, in this debate today, use some of the hard-earned resources of the Federal Government to reduce poverty in America? And if that is the case, if it is the view of this majority that legislation which increases the minimum wage in this legislation is a limited use of the Federal Government's resources and not a limited use of the

I thank my friend and colleague for the time. Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the Republican tax bill last week, some new bills have been introduced to repeal the legislation. At the heart of the bill is a 30-percent cut in the State and local tax deduction that many hard-working Americans take for many things they use to do everything from mail, run their businesses or pay their mortgage to pay for child care for their family. Because it was a part of the legislation last week, it was not immediately put in order.  I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney).  The amendment was agreed to. The Acting CHAIR. It is now in

Mr. Speaker, this is quite an interesting debate that we're having, and I think it's very important for the American people to understand the debate we are having here. This is not about whether or not Government of the people and through the people is a good idea or a bad idea. This is about a fundamental principle of our Founding Fathers and that is that no one can have a greater interest in the well-being of the people in a free society than the people themselves.  The bill that is before the House today is one step toward making sure that when people receive a free meal that it is a Federal-only thing. It's not a State-run thing. If you want to pay for a State-run or a local-run thing, you just pay for it yourself.  The fact of the matter is that

Strikingly, the PRO Act would destroy employee privacy rights by requiring employers to give away employees' personal information even if employees already choose to keep their sensitive data private. It would destroy employee privacy if employers and employees can't agree on what data to keep and when to keep it and have no standard for keeping it in the first place. And it would destroy jobs and livelihoods if employers have to provide employees with their personal information every time they visit the government.  As we debate this bill today, the vast majority of Americans feel that Congress should be working to increase the economy and strengthen our crumbling middle class.  Instead, this week, this Senate has chosen to jeopardize that productive work by weakening and eliminating important employer privacy rights.

Many of the Nation's farmers are faced with a very difficult economic time in the recent past. Farmers have been hit by devastating drought and other natural disasters. In addition to paying a higher annual premium in the face of these losses, farmers are forced to take out disaster loans to rebuild their businesses, so many are taking the hard economic decisions needed to save for the future and to provide for their families for the coming years.  Farmers who take out these loan plans should not be discriminated against because of where their State and farm are located. It is just common sense to support

Mr. President, responding to my friend, it seems quite unusual that these crocodile tears are being used as justification for legislation which would increase and even out the tax burden for the very best paying private employers. There is only one Federal law that specifically applies to this matter--the Federal law that I introduced with the Senator from Ohio which applies to self-employed. It would not apply to any other private employment income but only to self-employed. It is common sense and it is not too controversial. But as most of us know from the discussion today, when this was considered in committee and when it was reported out of committee, we did not expect that the only way to make this possible is to extend the provisions of the Federal law so that no State has any tax cuts at all and so that everyone pays the same amount of taxes.

We have had this kind of thing before and I think we should talk about it a little bit more because in this past Congress, we made a lot of very tough choices to try to get the economy back on track in the way we want it to be and to get this country in a position to put more money into people's pockets and be more accountable to people's needs. The problem is the budget deficit has continued to grow at an all-time high.  So we are having this debate, this pain and the pain is at least this House that has the opportunity to pick our leader, not the person who is in the

I might yield to the Senator from Rhode Island and say I would like to tell him what I have done if I were not here. He would not object.

I hope this is a voice we will hear more of this year. I hope he is the voice we will hear from the other side of the aisle when he gets up on the Supreme Court in the near future.  I want to note a couple of things I think are particularly revealing about this nominee. He has described himself as a Republican in law school, then a Republican in private practice and then a Republican in the House of Representatives before he went to the Supreme Court, a lawyer who was a law clerk for a Supreme Court justice. He is also a man of impeccable credentials and extraordinary legal skills. And yet all of that seems

Mr. President, the problem with this--and I could support it if it were made clearer--is that there is no provision in this legislation that will not ultimately kill jobs as a result of this legislation and very difficult circumstances, including one that we are confronted with that is going to go into effect in May, but there is no provision to say that we can put in some regulations that take time out of that issue to get it done so we don't lose jobs and so we can get them done so we don't have people without jobs that might otherwise be here but for the regulations because what we are trying to do is to deal with a problem that is so real for so many Americans.

Mr. Chairman, it is estimated that one out of every 17 children in the United States is homeless.

Mr. President, I was greatly disappointed by the vote of the Senate last Friday to endorse the nomination of Robert D. Rubin to be Secretary of the Treasury. I think that the overwhelming vote was for a more moderate and less politicized Treasury Secretary, and I think the Senate should be able to accept that view as reflected in the support that we had for him at that time. I thought that it was wrong to have us endorse that policy without having that support for the Secretary of the Treasury and not having to be the majority party because we saw clearly that this issue was very controversial and very personal to us in the Chamber. I think we should have the opportunity to approve him with that majority vote at that time.

Mr. President, the impression will not go away: The enormous Federal debt greatly resembles the number of days spent in its shape by President Reagan or George Bush. The impression is popular among many American political commentators who define the subject as the greatest example of our country's many flaws. This phenomenon is important and new in American political history. It has serious implications for the future of this country as well as for many other countries. A Nation that is not very prosperous is one in which most people do not work very many hours, many people work less than one-third of the hours one might be regarded as a great statesman.  The view among some commentators is that with the vast growth in the number of Americans working and the high quality of the work they do, with the low inflation and favorable savings rates, with all these other features

That is why we introduced the ``Caregivers Protection and Health Improvement Act of 1994,'' which would reestablish and strengthen our Nation's relationship with those who make our Nation's most vulnerable vulnerable caregiving family members.

Despite the long tradition of Presidents and Presidential nominees of disclosing their tax returns, Donald Trump recently announced that he would have released all of his tax returns ``very shortly.'' While he hasn't put a date on his tax-exempt status, the American people deserve to know how President Trump plans to disclose his full tax return, since any information he may wish to share will be publicly released. I want the American people to know that despite the lack of transparency that President Trump has shown on these tax returns, this failure to disclose is not the result of the President's refusal to cooperate. There are no legal protections against releasing a President's tax returns without a court order and no obligation to submit information to Congress. This legislation would not create any legal objections by the executive branch or the executive branch's allies, and Congress would have ample opportunity

I will say that to my friend from Oklahoma. He said in my State of Arkansas a lot of people do not agree with me. I am here today with my Senator from Iowa and with Senator Dole in a ``no back door'' or ``no amendment'' bill. So that is a fair statement. I say it to you that if there is any bill coming forward that should be called ``backdoor,'' it is this. There is no ``backdoor'' in this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is moving expeditiously on H.R. 3246, a bill that will establish an agency within the Department of the Interior to conduct a study to determine whether any states in the United States have comprehensive plans for implementing the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and to implement these plans. I would like to commend my colleagues from Virginia for bringing this bill forward.  The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 is a law that provides for a comprehensive approach to the management of existing Federal lands for the benefit of the Nation and the people they serve in our country. Because of this requirement for a comprehensive plan for managing Federal land, States have been able to look to the need to achieve environmental and economic goals as their primary approaches to managing their lands. In order to move to a holistic approach to managing Federal land,

It establishes the World Food Program as an independent agency and provides $1 billion for humanitarian assistance to hungry children through a freeze on discretionary and military spending over 2 years. It creates a Food Security Commission to ensure that all nations fully participate in this effort and to enhance the capacity of the United Nations to respond to a food emergency.  This legislation is long overdue and requires time for consideration of all aspects of the international food security plan and also the plans of the other agencies of the Federal Government relating to food security.

I think it is really important that we think about that every day. The children need the resources that we provide them to do things in school and do things in the community, but they need our attention on how we can go about giving them the resources that we expect them to have.  So I think we have to understand what is happening and think very clearly about it in the next few days as we begin this process of balancing the budget that is here before us.

I think it is inappropriate to go beyond what the private sector is doing at the point the Federal Government could do the better job of doing it.

Yet there is no death penalty in any sense of the word in this country except the death penalty in the District of Columbia or in the Federal courts there is.   Primarily because there is not an alternative and because it is very easy for a jury to come back with no conviction in the Federal system but where they could not find any other path than this one under which the capital punishment is a weapon used for violent crimes and it is very difficult to get a conviction for a capital crime for a capital offense anywhere in the country but in our Federal system.

In my opinion, absolutely not. It applies to other cases where a firearm is used, for example, as a weapon in an act of terrorism or any other purpose which I think the definition of use to which the Senator refers applies to as well.  The Emmer amendment has nothing to do with stopping the violence of radical Islamist extremists or any other purpose that they might wish to use in their attacks. I think he ought to be focused on stopping these criminals and not on a whole range of other people who are using their weapons, which is to my mind far more important. I think that is the reason why the Senator should be very careful before he moves to strike section 9 and make a blanket waiver which would apply to any additional weapons that he may deem to be necessary to carry out the purposes set forth in his amendment in another

Madam President, I rise today to mark a truly important day for my State, and a day that my State can be proud of. Today marks the first day of my fourth term in the U.S. Senate and as I speak, I have signed the discharge petition for my first-ever ``compassionate conservatism'' budget resolution. The kind of compassionate conservatism that I have worked hard to bring to the people of California's 26th Congressional District is an expression of the values of my party, for conservative values of family and compassion to care for all the people. It is an expression of conservative beliefs and values that I believe are exactly the best approach to solving the problems confronting our Nation. I take pride in the fact that we are both capable of finding common ground on an issue of great importance for the future of our Nation.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is vital for the future of my State and this country. I am heartened to hear that so many people are beginning to wake up to the consequences of this tragic epidemic of HIV disease.  HIV/AIDS has become such a public health and social crisis that the majority of Americans are all too aware of the dangers of a potential AIDS diagnosis. HIV is a very serious health problem, and prevention efforts are long overdue. Research is indeed needed to understand this disease and ways to prevent HIV infection. Understanding the causes and effect of AIDS has been crucial in determining that the future health of this disease is better than before. As is the case with many other medical problems, one of the most effective treatments is prevention. And research in recent years has shown that successful prevention programs may even

Mr. President, the assistance in this supplemental appropriations bill for victims of Hurricane Isabel and Hurricane Ivan was requested by the United States of America and made by the State of Florida. On November 20 and 22, 2004 and January 16, 2005 and on December 17, 2005, Federal, State, and local Government of the State of Florida made major contributions to the emergency preparedness for the hurricanes. The Federal assistance was in the form of $50 million for the first year and $75 million for the last year of the bill. As a part of this emergency preparedness funding and assistance, there were several Federal agencies that contributed more than $100 million in assistance to a major Federal disaster or emergency that threatened life and property and threatened the State's economy and future growth.

They are the same people who have filibustered the nonnuclear deal, which as you know was nearly derailed over those 5 cloture votes. I think that speaks for itself. I will just remind everyone that when we set these votes in motion, they were controlled by the same people who filed cloture, and they did not change anything.

Since the financial crisis of 2008, the financial services industry has been facing unprecedented regulation that has increasingly placed a stranglehold on the financial industry and on the financial markets and caused companies like MasterCard to now become responsible for some of the worst data breach in the history of our country's credit markets and on the financial services industry in general. For too long this agency, the Federal Reserve, has been preoccupied with regulating the credit card industry. This legislation is meant to provide the Federal Reserve with the tools necessary to carry out its oversight responsibilities and prevent future credit card abuse and others by providing a blanket exemption for the credit card companies from laws and regulations that would make the financial

Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one other comment on the compensation criteria, which I would think is a matter the chairman would be interested in following up on further this year when we return from the August recess.  The American taxpayers, through the Tax Code, pay $9 billion a year for medical bills that a physician would have to pay and would take care of anyway had they been able to deal with them themselves rather than pay for them out of their own pocket.  So this is a common sense amendment that would apply to all employees of the Federal Government and Congress and all Federal employees who make these medical care claims that the Office of Personnel Management takes so seriously as part of its statutory responsibility to protect the civil rights of the American people.  It is certainly something I support, and I hope the chairman will take a look

Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare health plans called cost contracts. Under legislation I have introduced in Congress, senior citizens who choose these plans will be able to keep their coverage even if their health care needs change. The private sector is currently forced to provide them with price control which results in them being shut out of the market and leaving seniors on their own with their health care decisions. I believe that the bill before us, the Health Care Cost Reduction Act of 2003, will provide seniors with more choice in their health care and bring down the price of health care for all Americans in the long term.  There is not a more important issue facing the American people today than our health care security and the continuing underfunding of Medicare and the President's signature health care reform legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to explain my bill with

I think the polls are showing that the Republican proposal to cut Medicare in order to provide a tax cut for the wealthiest individuals in our society is fundamentally flawed. Medicare should be used to pay for needed health care for our senior citizens and in order to reduce the deficit. Yet we can make a difference if we work together to find the money to cover the cost of this health care program as we intend to do. But this budget does not do that. This budget would take the votes out of the Democratic-controlled Senate this afternoon and have it go to the House on this Saturday before Friday has even been set for debate. In fact, if this budget were to pass, the House would vote on it tomorrow afternoon before Friday will be set for debate. So if it were to pass, there would not be the votes on Saturday

Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from California is correct. There are a lot of good items in this bill but some of the most important ones are tax cuts for middle class working families, reducing the death tax in this country so that people can pass their family down and pass their health care along to their children, and children can be tax free when they are born.  The bill includes a significant increase in the child tax credit in order to provide additional resources for special education for the most vulnerable of children so that they can be able to give their best effort to education and gain a bright future for themselves and their children.  Last year the President requested $3 billion for Head Start and this bill exceeds that request by $25 million in new funds for this important program.

One of the reasons I brought that question was because insurance companies, I believe in this body, have an objection to making a tax deductible cost of health insurance.  Insurance companies know if they are penalized by this proposal, there will be people that will get sick and not have insurance, they will simply choose not to purchase health insurance. They will then go to a competitor that offers a much lower, less affordable, alternative product, and the price will go up. The number of people who

Mr. Speaker, I rise to second the thought that the Speaker just made on the issue that we are talking about here on the floor today on this issue of a budget that cuts Medicare and Social Security by over $270 billion over the next decade and a half.  We can go back to our Speaker who is out here talking about the GOP budget that is going to have a profound impact on our children, our grandchildren, and our country for the next 50 years. The problem is, we have not passed a budget in this Congress since 1992 that reflects how the Republican Party intends to get there.  We have cut and run the Federal budget. We cannot do it when you have a Republican Congress that has a responsibility to govern, that we have a responsibility to educate our kids, we have a responsibility to bring up an agenda and

This bill would provide additional time for States to extend funding for health insurance to children, foster youth, and parents who are unemployed or underemployed.  This bill extends the deadline for States to expand health insurance coverage to at least 16 million American families by this fall of 2006. States have many challenges working to expand the availability of health insurance. States often struggle to secure sufficient assistance, financial assistance, or tax credits to cover all or even part of the out-of-pocket expenses of health insurance.  Some of the most pressing challenges faced by our States are those posed by inadequate coverage for children and families. And despite the economic

Mr. Chairman, equity in our approach to welfare, safety for the American taxpayer, and sending welfare recipients back to work is not one of the objectives in this bill.

Mr. Speaker, S. 1789 as passed by the Senate on February 7, provides for relatively modest adjustments to new nonpoint source programs which are justified by congressional intent and process. The legislation provides for a 1-year funding phaseout of noneconomic damages and 10-year time periods for damages to economic operations and utilities in which no restoration is essential or reasonably required.  These adjustments can be performed by agencies through designated study funds and waive environmental criteria required for waivers. The amendment to S. 1789 would direct the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to study existing law and the public interest impacts of adjustments to existing programs for nonpoint source programs to determine if these adjustments are appropriate. It directs the agency to make recommendations for voluntary feasibility studies for those programs which are eligible for funding under section 936(a)(5)

Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from Alaska. I think he makes an important point. For too long we have been talking about making certain that the education system has the means necessary to achieve that goal of equity, but the problem is the matter of policies that are set forth in Federal law. When we discuss things such as the legislation we are considering today or the two that we are discussing, I think that is part of the problem. We simply are not doing enough to meet the goals of so many of these programs that are included in this package.  For example, in the Federal Workforce Act we have been implementing a policy to transition from a work force to an employment process, the benefit of which is the mobility that people have had, and as we move into the 21st century we continue to put more and

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 31, the United States imported 6,831,000 barrels of oil each day, 722,000 barrels less than the 6,850,000 barrels imported during the same week a year ago.  Americans relied on foreign oil for 52.6 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil by U.S. workers and producers must be deeply concerned about what is happening in the oil industry.

Mr. Speaker, according to Medicare trustees, that program requires an immediate 51 percent cut, a 15 percent reduction of physician health care alone this year alone. That means some 31,000 Medicare providers would stop providing essential care and there would be a corresponding reduction in the number of beneficiaries that are enrolled in Medicare because of a shortfall in that program and the level of services that are provided there under Medicare Part D. So the notion that this kind of reduction will take care of anything but what really matters is simply without reality. We need to have the attention of this House in terms of what the realities are here in the practice of providing needed health care to our Nation's seniors.

We know these people work for the Federal Government of the United States of America. And we know these people are risking their lives for the Federal Government of the United States of America. It is their livelihoods and our livelihoods that we need to preserve and protect.  The first amendment we have done in this legislation is what the author of this amendment has proposed, which was the basic so-called cap and trade. In other words, the first amendment would cap production at just the amount of coal

Will the Senator yield for a clarification? This most certainly is an open process. What we are seeking to do is ensure that as many opportunities as possible be given to Senators to have amendments that would be considered in the order in which they were offered so that we will not be left waiting for amendments that the majority leader would like to make part of the rule before the time expired. Is that his understanding as well?  Indeed, when the Senate got back from the weekend last week, there were 10 amendments in the so-called reading period to be debated this morning. We have a large number of them lined up to be made part of the 5 minutes for consideration of the other 15 amendments that were in that 5 minutes time limit on Monday when we had a busy day of debate on the SCHIP bill with amendments being debated in

As the head of the Congressional Coalition to Rescue Torture, Chairman Solomon--a fellow New Yorker--has stated, today Mexico is not just a trading partner to the United States, it is also our strategic partner and ally in the war against drugs and terrorism.

Madam Speaker, this amendment is a perfect example of how people can fall off both sides of a perfectly good bill before it even gets to the House floor. After the House passed the underlying bill in May of this year, the Senate reauthorized the State Children's Health Insurance Program and last week the Senate passed a very short-term extension that lasted just a few minutes. Yet, despite the fact that a short-term extension was passed without an emergency designation of a continuing resolution, this entire process failed to get to the Senate floor. Instead the Senate reauthorized the program only in the few minutes it was left after it had all lapsed after a budget agreement was reached with the House on the level of the initial extension. So rather than have a strong bill that would keep the program running and keep children from having to leave the

I just want to make the point that we cannot say we want to do it because we want the one particular kind of job in America where somebody is willing to do it all for a couple of dollars a day and for a good living for those few few years they have for the rest of their life in America. If we do not do it now, we cannot say we want to do it because we want a system that is more efficient, that is more market-based so we can get the benefits of our people who are doing it better than everybody else but somebody will get the money first so they can make the best money of it and the one who is not will be pushed out of it and

Mr. President, on May 26, President Clinton made the difficult and courageous decision to renew the nuclear nonproliferation treaty with Russia. This is the first of many important steps which he has taken to renew America's commitment to the safety and security of the world's nuclear weapons systems. A bill passed by the House of Representatives last week shows the overwhelming support for this treaty which Mr. Clinton has put in the President's desk. But the real victory over this policy will come after the President signs this conference report and the treaty is ratified in the United States by the Congress. Because it has been 2 years since the Clinton administration said we would no longer certify that Russia would not violate the treaty, we need to be on the lookout for new problems to put this country on record as one of the leaders in defending nuclear nonproliferation

Madam President, today I wish to highlight the 100-year history of the Triangle Cooperative Service Organization, the organization responsible for food service in the Triangle community and the Northern Mariana Islands. Today marks the 20th anniversary of their acquisition by the local cooperative health and services organization, which in turn has since expanded to assist the people of the Northern Mariana Islands in maintaining the traditional food service services of the islands themselves.  The Triangle Cooperative Service Organization is an organization that is run by North Korean refugees that exists primarily in the community of Ensign and to which there are currently 7,000 North Koreans that work for the organization. But its members also serve more than 100,000 people in the Northern Mariana Islands food system who maintain this great national food service organization for the islands.

We and our residents across this great Nation have the privilege of supporting memorials to and remembrance of our service men and women who served our country, and our cherished memories which are forever woven through the fabric of California life.  In honoring these brave Americans, the United States of America asks that we remember the realities of war

Thank you, Mr. President._______________________________________________________________________ N O T I C E A final issue of the Washington Times reports the disclosure that the $90 million of funding provided in the fiscal year 1993 Defense Appropriations Bill contains an excessive number of private construction items without the requisite matching funds or material to complete that project. This is an abuse of the bill's priorities and an unfair credit against the Government of the United States for its effort to complete these projects. I wish to join my colleagues in pressing for this correction in the Record as we make our final statements in the Senate on this bill. The provision in the bill will result in significant budget savings to the Government in the year 1996, thus causing the cost savings to allay some of the concerns raised by the Senate majority that the program at the time of its inception was not able to provide for the higher cost

Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman would continue to yield, this is not a medical procedure. I would say it is a treatment for the physician or treating medical practice in treating an illness or illness and treating that illness through the use of some of the new medical procedures that would be offered in this legislation. It is not a medical procedure. It is medical technology coming to the point that we can treat a new disease or illness or illness and treat it with medical technology and medicine that has been developed.  If this is the kind of care that we are talking about, what are the American people going to pay for it?   conferees recommend to add $28 billion for research on cholesterol-lowering drugs, $150 million for research on prevention of cancer.   additional $31 billion for higher education initiatives and $115

Mr. Chairman, hard-working American families are paying a high price at the gas pump today as a result of high energy prices. According to the Energy Information Administration this morning, the natural gas futures market will be above $4.99 on Thursday, from the highest price hit in more than a decade. Since 2006, only six times have futures oil traded above $4.99. This is only the latest example of bad government policies at work at the pump.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration has cited a number of reasons that would keep America's energy markets affordable today, not the least of which is market uncertainty. Again, gas prices are always volatile and the pressure on them in a desperate economic climate continues to get more severe every day.  Last week, this House voted to freeze prices and to slow the pace of

It is kind of interesting that when I was President of the United States when this Congress passed the original Social Security plan, the State of the Union Address to the American people told them that we are now going to have to extend Social Security to all those who work in America and their children who are in the Social Security system. In the State of the Union Address to the American people, the President said that he wanted to extend Social Security to the 15 million people in the United States who cannot work today but who want to work but do not have a full-time job or who are totally dependent on a State-based system of pensions to get by,

Madam Chair, this amendment reflects a simple principle. The government does not and should not spend more of America's money than it takes in. Yet the Republicans in the House and the other body have only increased spending at a rate of 1 percent a year on their budget since the beginning of this Congress. It seems to me the time has come to really reform the way the Federal Government operates and to end the way they operate.  It is no secret the government spends too much money right now, but it has not been reformed to take the necessary money out of other programs to put in the government for the American people to use for the good things they need them to do that we would like to see the government to spend for them.

The gentleman's amendment would cut $2 million from the Office of Policy and Program and $2 million from the Office of Legislative Counsel in order to save the Office of Policy and Program $4 million over the next 5 years in this budget. In other words, what the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Frost] wants to do is cut $2 million from the Office of Policy and Program so that he can cut $4 million in funding for legal services in the next 5 years.  So if you would have agreed to this amendment back in March of 1993, we could have taken $2 million away from the Office of Legislative Counsel in order to save money for us in the next 5 years. We could have spent $2 million less than what we spent last year in the Legal Services Program. And we could have spent $4 million

Madam President, a lot of progress has been made. We are doing extremely well. I think this bill is moving along very well and we will be at that point when we will be able to debate this bill and vote on it.  I am urging Senators to come to the floor and offer their amendments in that light of the conference report so that we can have an up-or-down vote on the conference report. I think it will be a good result for the body and it will be a good result for the Senate. I hope we will be able to have some votes. I do not want to lose any time on the other side of the aisle, so I am anxious to see if we can get a number of votes on this agreement in a timely fashion so we can have up-or-down votes on the conference

He is going to work through all this, and we will just make sure he is here tomorrow, but as soon as we can get him here, then we will get this bill up on the House floor and we will make sure he is here tomorrow. That is what he will do. He has been very focused on the committee on national security and economic issues as well as appropriations bills and homeland security issues and those matters.

Mr. President, my question flowing from what we have learned and the various issues we have had in the last few days to this point has been to the majority leader, and to all of us that have been involved in the process. How would the United States Senate handle a situation in which the Government of Iran has done things it has not wanted to do in Iraq, including the invasion of Iraq by Saddam Hussein in which thousands of our soldiers died, particularly the great body of Iraqi blood, and that there is now a program, one which is not on the books, one which is operational, no Iraqi remains, which the President was insisting on getting better sanctions against, a program, to put it bluntly, which is another one of those carefully constructed political charades that it has become all too common in the past few days.

I thought that Members of Congress were supposed to be invited to votes on the House floor every day so Members can help shape the policy and take a stand on issues like minimum wage and health care. I was fooled for a little while this evening by Speaker Gingrich and his cohorts in this House on what was supposed to be the time when we would actually have the House take up the issue of health care reform and its companion in the Senate and in the White House. Apparently the people in this country have made a decision to put an end to the political process and to place some value on the last day before the January 11 congressional recess. So instead of taking up health care and seeing the House take up a bill that has a three-fifths majority and was authored by Senator Harry Reid and others on

Madam Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal from the White House is a reverse Robin Hood in reverse of the program we created under Medicare. Rather than pay for Medicaid expansion through new taxes, the poor are left with an even smaller Federal-run government in the form of Medicaid, which they still cannot afford.  We are told that higher premiums will actually encourage people to sign up for Medicaid, but if you look at actual signup rates, you will see that enrollment in Medicaid has actually fallen. Over the last 7 years, enrollment has actually declined, and it is falling by 17 percent.  The formula under which Medicaid expansion will be funded is the worst possible. The President has calculated that a national private plan will save taxpayers $32 billion over 7 years, and Medicaid will not pay for that provision.  I believe that poor people

In 2006, President Bush told us that if we had a bill on the floor of this House that had anything to do with national defense that was even close to the minimum that was in the 9/11 Commission report which said ``September 11 was an attack on America, and it was not an attack on America but was an attack on American security.''

Mr. President, as Congress begins next year to consider a range of policy choices in the area of defense policy, the unique position of the Army is being highlighted for some scrutiny. As the most capable fighting force in the world today, the Army must plan to meet this challenge in a manner that more closely conforms to the needs of our armed forces in the years ahead. The Army has not been consulted since the mid-1970's with respect to this important matter, and it seems likely that it would have more to do with more limited operational training than a decision to expand capabilities was intended by the establishment of the Army Task Force on Foreign Operations and Human Rights in 1990. It has been clear for some time now that the Army has been engaged in a wide range of counterterrorism activities that involve U.S. military personnel in combat operations

So we will have many more days ahead in this very productive session of the Senate in looking forward to continued cooperation and discussion with the majority leader to make sure we can bring these things

Mr. President, this Saturday, May 3, marks the 50th anniversary of sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski's arrival in Chicago. In the New York Times of February 5, 1982, the writer called Ziolkowski a pioneering sculptor who created a sculpture which he could put to use in what he considered to be one of the most magnificent homes in all of America. He remarked that the sculpture of the city of Chicago reflects ``the spirit of American tradition and the inventive spirit which has characterized the genius of art in the West for the last century.''  Korczak Ziolkowski started working at the age of 17 when he designed a sculpture of the Chicago River which was to be used in the 1930's for the Hollywood film ``The Bridges of Madison County.'' The ``Chicago River Crossing'' was envisioned as the city in which the film studio and the East Side

Mr. President, simply put, I believe this amendment would be a harsh and unnecessary step by the Government of Israel against its own citizens and to the Jewish people and against its own Government. The United States must take an active role in protecting the life and freedom of the American Jewish community and its leadership from the threats of foreign interference. Israel is the only free and democratic State in the Middle East and should not be subjected to such an attempt to impose its will on other states. Moreover, Israel has been a beacon of freedom in the region for many years and a cornerstone of peace in the Middle East.  As an honorary member of the American Bar Association and the Human Rights Legal Clinic, I feel it is my duty to support this amendment and support its intention to preserve the rule of law in Israel.

Now the proposal was that the House would have agreed to a permanent increase in that amount in the same way that that was agreed to by the Senate.

The abuses of the State Peace and Development Council's Executive Committee are appalling. To my knowledge, they have never been previously investigated by the Burmese government. And the findings of the United Nations investigators must be investigated and proven.  In fact, I believe the Rohingyas have a right to return to their homes.

Reserving the right to object, I believe the majority leader realizes there is a way to get to the finish line to complete this legislation but not to have to risk it and to have to take an extreme action to end the situation and to have it both ways for a few minutes or weeks. So I do not have to object. I have been there many times in the past years as the majority leader has in the past years. I know my colleagues would have a lot of respect for him if they were in his shoes for a few minutes to be judge and jury in the House and in the Senate.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is a very important amendment because we are discussing real tax relief for the American people that President Clinton wants to provide for the middle class. I come to the floor today because I understand how important it is that we pass tax relief for working families in order to strengthen our economy and create jobs. As the unemployment rate continues to climb in many States and as the economy continues to struggle, more families are struggling to make ends meet and provide for their families. The costs that Americans and businesses have to pay on top of those enormous costs are a burden. That burden must be cut and taxes must be lowered. That is what this amendment does.  In addition to lower taxes on working families, this amendment would allow businesses to provide some tax deductions for part-time employees to help put food on

We have here those Americans who have been afraid for so long for a real choice and have now seen it and come together in defense of the Constitution of the United States that will not be taken away by a President who has no respect for the Constitution that has been put in place over 240 years ago and over which the Constitution is the law of the land. So we have this bill that would do all of these things and so many other things that, in fact, this body has debated about and passed in the past.  There is one other issue that we had to clear this afternoon that is coming out of the Rules Committee; that is, not having a minimum wage increase as part of this package.

Mr. Speaker, I am here today to add my voice to those celebrating the 150th anniversary of the Union Congress in Philadelphia today. Uniontown was the first town in Philadelphia and the first city in Pennsylvania that I got to meet in school. In Pennsylvania 1765 it was a former factory that I now work in as the Democratic Illinois representative.  In the first days of the war in 1765, my brother Robert helped build a canal to transport supplies across the border into Philadelphia to provide for war needs. In the fall of 1765, when the troops of the newly formed Commonwealth were marching through Philadelphia, it was Uniontown that Robert stood next to me in the so-called Hudson River Scullery and offered him bread to eat. We both got a taste for the history that this city would live.  Uniontown also used

I want to support him on this issue because I think the more we can get the private sector involved, the better off we are going to be in terms of solving this issue that most Americans have gotten to accept through this process. But the more we get the private sector involved in solving this problem, I think we will get this to a successful conclusion in a much more efficient way and a much more effective way. That is the goal we are pursuing in this legislation and that is what we should pursue in every other way we can get the private sector involved in making this a success.   Madonna still has the same good will and the same determination to help me make these reforms that have been so difficult to get to this point in the past for years and years.

Mr. President, just a few remarks. I appreciate the comments of the Senator, who is a very good Senator and is a champion of the Constitution, which for the last 2 years I have worked on with Senator Simon to try to create a Constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Senator Simon has worked to ensure that we can finally accomplish this objective and we will.  As I have talked to Senator Simon and listened to him in the Committee on Appropriations, it is not just about the Social Security trust fund, which is a Government account that we control. It is also about issues of the whole State and local budget. For example, there has been a record amount of cuts in the Seattle area in the last couple of years, so there has been a lot of strain on our transit system, local housing and education systems.

One important point is that if the Senate considered the Interior appropriations bill today and passed the bill by a large margin as reported by the committee with a high level of support as I expect it will be before the end of the month, the Senate would have to do just the same on the Department of Housing and Urban Development bill that it would have to do today if the Senate considered the Interior appropriations bill as reported by the committee this afternoon and passed it by a large margin.

This legislation has been introduced by Representatives Barton of Texas and Coleman of Florida and will be considered by the full House of Representatives at the end of the 103d Congress.  The United States Supreme Court has considered this issue in several cases and has held that although courts are generally and largely nonpolitical entities and do not necessarily have the expertise in cases involving allegations of domestic violence and sexual abuse, such as those brought by victims of incest and other crime of violence, those courts should apply civil rights law to issues involving these issues.

Mr. President, our dear colleague left out one very important fact about this amendment. This amendment does not apply to any facility receiving more than $50 million in Federal investment over the next 5 years. The Senator from Utah is correct that when a facility receives the $50 million they pay in Federal revenue share, they can reduce that money by making any cash savings available to the operation or improvement of that facility in the local area in which it is located.  What this is about is making sure we have an operation that is efficient and has a sense of community and which operates efficiently to all of its local residents. So it would not apply to any $50 million facility.  The reason we have it is because the large part of the $100 million in this bill is dedicated to the Coast Guard modernization, of which $10 million is

I think it is important that we do so because when the leadership on both sides of the aisle understand that there is going to be much less support and less ability of Members of the House to pass this legislation than they have been able to now for so many years and that Members will not have to go back home and say we are getting it all done now and that we are ready to pass it and get the President to sign it, it will go a long way to assure that the American people are not going to be put at risk any

Mr. President, I would note that we have approved, first, 100 in the 17 months since the day that the President issued the executive order in July of 2006. We have never had a higher approval rate from the American people than today because it is not political. We have an epidemic of health care in this country, and it is because of the action of this administration and the Democrats that we have seen the number of Americans with a preexisting condition dropped from 32 million to 15 million to 14 million. So the President has delivered on his promise. I thank him for that and the reason he took the action he has taken and the numbers of people who have had a preexisting condition has been dropped dramatically since he has been President. He is absolutely correct in that.  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time

Mr. Speaker, Federal transportation law currently penalizes communities like Redding and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in my congressional district for having passed bylaws that have a Federal infrastructure contribution as a nonroadable use. This is a bad idea. Communities already have no option but to use roadways when they are able to. What this law does is make them trade-offs between the cost of complying with the Federal law and the use of their roads for other purposes, and I do not believe it is good policy and has a real impact on the way we move communities and goods around the country.  Now the Republicans in the other body, Mr. Speaker, have taken a different approach to local transportation and have now passed legislation that will allow communities to build in support of their local government, and this bill will allow communities to build in support of their local government

Mr. President, the proposed cuts we are talking about will devastate Indian country. They strike at the heart of our Nation's long-term security and economic growth in that the cuts will force the Federal Government to enact $4 billion in new spending and increase the share of Federal assistance in the national debt from 25 percent now to 30 percent by the year 2002.  I have made this point before. These are real problems of great consequence to American Indian and Alaska Native people as they fight to stay in the United States and to be part of the American Dream. These are the problems of our communities that have been waiting for all too long for solutions and solutions that strengthen their interests. They have waited for Congress to give them the opportunity to determine for themselves what problems in this country and in the country's entire economic history they really want solved.

Mr. President, this amendment would modify section 124 of the bill. In its present form it is clearly a Republican provision because it is a provision which is included in the bill which was passed by the House without the Democratic amendments that is what is there. This is not legislation that the leadership in the House wanted to have in there. We are taking it out of there to allow the House to adopt the bill which they passed by voice vote without it having to be altered by any Member of the House of Representatives in the Senate and in this case having to go to conference between the House and the Senate and having it be substantially the same as it is in the House. This is the way that we do that and would be the only way the conference could be completed on the bill without having the Senate change the bill at all or change anything

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be authorized to meet to conduct a hearing on Thursday, July 11, 2007 at 10 a.m., in the Senate Dirksen Office Building Room 226 on the nomination of John M. Sheehan to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Alabama. John Sheehan is nominated to fill the vacancy created when the confirmation of Judge Thomas C. Fallon was held up by Senator Shelby's Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee.  The lessness of this nomination is further underscored by the lack of other Federal judges of Alabama and the lack of Federal judicial nominations in Alabama. Alabama is home to 23 Federal judges of the circuit and appellate courts of the United States and nine State supreme court nominees currently on the Federal bench. Alabama is home to

Mr. President, let me indicate with respect to the question of reconciliation being used for this matter that I have an agreement that we will have the opportunity to debate this on the floor for a period of time of no less than 1 hour. It is my understanding we will have to debate this again for that period of time because we have an agreement that we would not need a time agreement on the bill because of the fact that there would not be time to debate it to the extent it is provided to the House today. Therefore, we will go back to this point and have a limited debate time to the extent this will enable us to vote at 5 or 6 o'clock or so. But it should be understood that the legislation would not come to the floor under an agreement that would require a time agreement because it was not entered into

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe the 100th anniversary of Muir Woods National Historic Park in the State of Washington. This unique historical park is located in the city of Tofino in the south central region of Washington State and contains more than 50 historical examples of the history and culture of northern Washington State. Over the course of the next century, the park will be recognized for the contributions that the community and the Federal Government made to provide opportunities for recreation and education in the region.  Over the years, the park has been the home to many important projects and events, including the construction of the National Bell Telephone Company and the California Pacific Railroad. It was designated an official wilderness in 1972, making the park a true wilderness refuge and allowing citizens to enjoy the rich local history, culture, and natural beauty in the wilderness. In

Madam President, I applaud the work of Chairman Dodd on this issue, as on so many other issues of which we have heard so much about in recent weeks. We have been working very hard on this issue since Dodd first brought it to the floor last November. So while we continue to disagree on the exact number of jobs that are at risk from this plan, I am very proud of what has been accomplished in the House, where we finally got an up-or-down vote on our job training bill in July. The issue of whether to fix this particular provision in the stimulus package has been going on for quite some time. Most people don't really understand this very well. But this is a piece of legislation that is totally unnecessary and totally unsustainable in the long run. It would add another $25 billion to the already-significant

Mr. Speaker and colleagues, it is a great pleasure this morning to join in welcoming my good friend and friend from North Carolina, Congresswoman Herger, as she was here on the House floor to give a special speech to the House about her experience here in the Congress.  As the example I gave today was not a speech but a prayer, I wanted to take a moment today to pray for the care of those who are nursing the wounds of this terrible day in history that occurred in the middle of the night on September 11, 2001.  As we prayed, I thought about the Senator from Illinois and the other four United States Senators who had been in the building. We thought about the others that were injured as they passed out of the building. And we thought about their family members that were in their families who were helping to

In fact, in the same letter that he had just given the Ways and Means Committee in which he is the chairman that he also is not supportive of the No Child Left Behind Act which provides for increased funding in the States for their public education system and that such a problem was not of the same magnitude that we are faced with in the case of the Social Security problem. It is not the only problem that he is concerned about and he is interested in the people of the Seventh District of California and other States where that problem is an area that he is concerned about and

Madam Chairman, I rise today with this amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. The amendment proposes to remove the Federal role in administering the Weyerhaeuser wetlands and develop additional reserve activities at Weyerhaeuser in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to meet the needs of our military bases and civilian communities. The amendment is similar to legislation I have introduced in the House of Representatives to address concerns about military bases with their Corps of Engineers and Army Corps of Engineers as well as the State of Pennsylvania. The bill H.R. 1440 funds the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection the first 100 grants for dredging or otherwise doing wetlands dredging on Weyerhaeuser. The amendment will begin to restore to the D.E.A. appropriations the authority to transfer dredged materials from Pennsylvania to the E.P.A.
