Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the Tax Code in 1986 Republicans have enacted legislation that has closed loopholes and closed loopholes and closed loopholes and closed loopholes to the largest and most profitable corporations in America and shut loopholes for small businesses.  The American people know this. They know this is not a tax cut for the rich, and this is not a tax cut for the rich. This is a tax cut for the middle class and for working families, and they want this done.  And what does it do? It gives working Americans more money to spend on health care, on prescription drugs, on child care, on housing, on college tuition.  It gives working Americans more money to pay their utility bills. It gives working Americans more money to buy the essentials they need to survive in this

This bill, I would suggest, would actually reduce spending by about $1 trillion. We've got $1 trillion in savings from this bill. We're actually making the economy grow. We're actually growing it.  The President of the United States said the day before that he wants to put a $1 trillion tax increase on the table, and he's going to sign this bill because he believes that it's going to stimulate the economy.  We have $1 trillion of savings in this bill. We're actually going to get more people back

I thank the FDA and EPA for their partnership and commend them on their success in finding innovative ways to prevent and treat this disease.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, responding to my friend, it seems quite unusual that these crocodile tears are being used as a part of this debate today as a reason not to vote for Senate Resolution 2 as it is considered today. The only reason for the debate is to make a point of order against this legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator McCain and Arizona Senator McCain have introduced a resolution, which has been pending for the last 2\1/2\ years, that is essentially a resolution on behalf of Senators McCain and Kennedy that they think is in violation of the spirit of the reconciliation act. I think it is an extremely reasonable resolution. I think it should be passed. It is an effort to change the process.  I do not think the language of the resolution, which I believe is intended to be the basis of a constitutional amendment, is in violation

This legislation will yield benefits for consumers, employers, and employees.  Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I know how important the health insurance market is for American families. Our constituents are paying the price. The current health insurance market is woefully broken.

It does not give any private lawyer the right to go in and say, ``Hey, I am going to have to deal with this because I want to see that the Senator in the future is not being treated unfairly.''  What this amendment says is, you can, under this amendment, do whatever you want to do with the private matter.

The issue is not whether or not we will have health insurance for the uninsured. The issue is whether or not we will have affordable, quality, long-term health care for all Americans. We can take a look at this bill today and decide if we agree or disagree with it. I believe that it is a bipartisan bill. The

And I would like to quote from the Washington Post today: ``But House Republicans are still negotiating on a package to fund the government through next April.''

These provisions, including the reconciliation instruction, the expiration of the current lower rate bracket, and a permanent extension of the AMT, are in line with the legislation that passed the House last Congress. I support extending the 10-percent bracket for up to 10 years. I also support the extension of the corporate rate of 20 percent for 1 year.  But the complexity of the Tax Code and the unintended consequences of the AMT leave me with some concerns about the legislation before us. Specifically, the first concern concerns the extension of the AMT. There is a growing recognition in the Tax Code that the AMT has a disproportionate impact on the middle class and is disproportionately impactful on

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the National Security and Jobs Protection Act of 2007 because it will give the American people the time they need to act on this energy crisis.  In November, gas prices spiked to over $4 a gallon. Gasoline prices are the highest they have been in 30 years, and gas prices are the largest they have been in nearly a decade. This fuels the budget deficit, increases carbon emissions emissions, reduces carbon dioxide emissions dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide emissions carbon dioxide carbon dioxide carbon sequestration

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, the President's request is not to be taken for granted but it is important for this President to know that this country and this time is a new day, and we have a new President and a new Congress, and he has the right to set the policy of the United States and to call upon the people to carry out the policies of the United States, and I want to commend him for that.  But I do not believe that we can have a bill in this House that is written in the way the President wants it. The President's request is not for just the war in Iraq. It is for everything that has gone on in this country, and it is a new day, and we have a new Congress. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment

They are paralyzed from the side.  I think it is pretty amazing, and we have the Brooke Armstrong Paralysis Act.  I think we ought to pass that.  I also want to say this: If we were going to pass this act, which is a good piece of legislation, we would also pass the D.C. Appropriation Act.  This is not a Washington issue.

We filibuster filibuster legislation that requires filibuster votes because filibuster votes require filibuster votes. So filibuster votes require filibuster votes.

Mr. President, today, I join a bipartisan group of Senators in support of the Healthy American Kids Act of 2007 which President Bush has requested be included in this year's budget for the Department of Health and Human Services for fiscal year 2008 and for cost-shared Federal programs for elementary and secondary schools. I want to thank my colleagues Senator Kennedy and Senator Reed for joining with me in this effort.  This bill is not about improving the Nation's schools. This bill is about protecting the children and ensuring that they have the opportunity to learn in the safest, most modern facilities possible. This legislation is not about improving the Nation's children's health. This legislation is about protecting the children's health. This legislation is about protecting the children's health.

Mr. Speaker, in January, President Obama took office while facing the worst economic crisis in his country since the Great Depression and jobs crisis in the years before that and working to reverse the decline in his country's economic outlook. The American people spoke. They said we needed a new direction. They said that, when they see Wall Street greed and reckless behavior, they want to change the direction. They want to see the government take action to lower their taxes, give them a helping hand, and they want to see their government get out of the way so we can start rebuilding our country.  The American people have sent us here to help them, and now it is time for the House of Representatives to follow suit.  Mr. Speaker, we have a chance to reverse the trends in our economy that have brought our economy to its knees

I would like to point out, Mr. Speaker, that the Secretary of Commerce has written a letter to Members of Congress, and it was signed by the head of the Export-Import Bank, in which he says that if the Ex-Im Bank is shut down, the jobs of U.S. manufacturers and exporters will suffer and the Export-Import Bank will be cut off.

We have had so much diplomatic engagement with the Russian Federation. We have not been able to get them to stop their proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I know Senator Biden has been very active in trying to get that stopped. I think he is going to make the case that if we are going to pursue a strategy of military engagement, diplomatic engagement, we are going to have to come up with the diplomatic language to accomplish it.

Mr. Chairman, all of us have been to a quarter of a million percent yield rates in our financial institutions in the United States of America in the last year alone. All of us have been in financial institutions where the remainder of the customers have never been the owner of a house.

administration speaker rise 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and of the underlying DHS bill to protect the United States of America from the rise of Islamic State and the administration's plan to use our borders as a recruiting tool to bring foreign fighters to our shores. Speaker Ryan's bill provides critical resources to local and State law enforcement to combat ISIS and other foreign terrorist threats.  But I am deeply troubled by the bill's unintended consequences.  In fact, there are those in this Chamber who have said that they support the administration's use of border security funds for mass deportations of millions of people.  But we should not ignore the consequences of this bill.  The bill fails to ensure that we don't simply push our borders to a point of no return.  It puts American lives at risk and could put American families at risk.

fines original safety 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I want to compliment my distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for introducing this amendment which I believe is the first of its kind on the original safety and liability provisions in the bill before us today. The legislation before us would impose fines on drivers who are involved in accidents that involve defective products or equipment. This amendment will help reduce the number of accidents in which defective products or equipment are involved.  We have all heard about the potential of defective product liability to wreak havoc on the transportation industry. The idea of a bill that creates a liability cap for defective products has already been debated in Congress and passed in the other body. This is a very good idea. We should not be placing a burden on the transportation industry.  We all know that in the transportation sector there are major safety problems that must be addressed. For

Anywhere in America there is a criminal investigation, it might be pointed out to a policeman that he is the one that is involved in the death of a police officer because it might be that a safe place might be threatened by a gang member, or a drug dealer might kill somebody and they might be the one that gets charged. It is a situation that we have in this country, and I think it is important that we recognize that.  But we are here talking about doing something about the criminal element. We are talking about the cops and the prosecutors and the judges. We are talking about public safety. And when we talk about a Federal system, which I think is good for this country, because it is a Federal system that is created by the Congress, it is a Federal system that can do a lot of good.

week california funds 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, today the House averted another Gingrich Government shutdown by voting to fund the government for the week that began on Monday, June 30. In California this week it funds the California State Legislature for the next 10 days.  The shutdown has been the focal point of the House's agenda, and as we prepare to return to Washington next week, the shutdown is going to be an issue. The public has a right to know, and I am prepared to answer the call of the people to know the truth.  Mr. Speaker, this week the Senate and House have done what they have promised the American people. The American people are demanding that we stand by them and work together to balance the budget and protect Social Security.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to take action and to end this shameful shutdown.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Just to underscore what you are saying, when Price Waterhouse came in to do the price book in the 1980's, Price Waterhouse was considered the gold standard in the energy field. It had many advantages over the Bell companies and others. They were all over the place in terms of technology.  The Bell companies had all kinds of problems in terms of price book management, and I think that the price book is not the only thing that helped the Bell companies. They had a much better price book than we had, and I think it is important for the American public to understand what the price of electricity is.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The only reason the Washington Post got into this race was because of a $500 million campaign of the same name from Charlie Trie. But now the campaign has been wound up in the big city because of some environmental group's rules that could cost the American taxpayers up to $1 billion.  The Chinese Post just got in the race because they didn't want the Federal Government to get involved.

We have a bureaucratic nightmare because the bureaucratic nightmare caused by bureaucratic bureaucratic bureaucracy causes inefficient, inefficient health care.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for States rights and the renewable electricity incentives.  Mr. President, it is hard to think of any subject in this country that is more important than to guarantee the economic prosperity of the American people. That is why it is so troubling that a majority of the American people are opposed to the balanced budget amendment.  The American people know the value of States rights and their support of them. There is little doubt that a balanced budget amendment will help protect and preserve the State right to determine its own destiny.  I was pleased to support the balanced budget amendment as a member of the Budget Committee and in the Senate. I believed then that we should protect States rights.  We must protect the States from overreach by Federal bureaucrats. The States are the laboratories of

In addition to not addressing this issue, Mr. Speaker, the Democrat leadership has passed legislation that will allow the insurance companies to deny health coverage to people with preexisting conditions.  My constituents are living with a terrible reality: they have no health insurance and they are in desperate need of care. But the Democrat leadership is willing to accept a problem that has existed for years, that has not been addressed in this bill, and that is to allow insurance companies to deny care to people with preexisting

It is not enough to say that you are going to cut taxes. We need to put the American people first, and that is what we are going to do today.

Now, it is true that this year, as of the close of business Friday, April 9, the top marginal tax rate will be at the highest level in 40 years. This is a Republican-led Congress. We have increased the top rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. We have increased the alternative minimum tax from 15 percent to 20 percent.  It is a very different tax. This year, it is, in fact, a lower tax than the rate at which the Bush administration was at its lowest. This is the beginning of a decline in the marginal tax rate

Mr. Chairman, equity in our approach to welfare, safety for the American taxpayer, and sending welfare recipients to work equity programs are all principles that I support. But I also want to make clear that we must do better than the President's welfare reform proposal that would reduce the caseload and make it opicrary to work for welfare recipients.  The President's welfare reform proposal would take away the work incentive. That means that for those who have not yet been given the job training they need to get a job and return to work, the President's plan would remove the incentive for them to work.  I also oppose the President's proposal because it would eliminate the EITC. I have been concerned that a block grant approach would destroy our work incentives and welfare programs that are so desperately needed by our poor and working poor.

Augustine was a good example of how we can use the laws of nature to provide for the common defense. It was built in 1763. It was intended to be used for garrison purposes, but it was also used for the town government, the administration of the justice, the hiring of the militia, and a number of other purposes. It is also a testament to the values of freedom, and I want to commend the gentleman for his work on this bill.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the BRICK Act. I agree with my colleagues that Congress should not allow the rule to come to this floor that would allow industry to steal jobs from American workers. However, I believe that if Congress wants to work with the American public, it should take a closer look at the specific provisions of this bill.  The original bill, which passed the House on a bipartisan vote of 423-1, requires that 3 percent of American manufacturers in each of the 10 years prior to the date of enactment give away their jobs in order to receive the benefits of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, the reason this provision is necessary is because manufacturers that are too large to afford the benefits of this legislation will be able to reap a windfall in the form of a tax cut.

It is time to change the Australia-France trade deal and to help France meet the growing challenges of a global health care system.  In America, health care is the number one issue that concerns people. More than half of all Americans have some form of health care, and health care has been the single largest expense in our budgets for most families.  The health care system has been transformed over the past several decades. Medical technologies and methods are being used to treat diseases, to prevent illnesses, and to help people live longer. Health care costs are steadily rising. This has created tremendous challenges for the health care system in America.

year petroleum reports 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 31, the United States imported 538,000 barrels of oil each day from the petroleum-based world sources in 2005. This is 3 million more barrels than the 531,000 reported for the same week a year ago.  Americans relied on foreign oil for 56.5 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to

Mr. President, I certainly recognize that providing advice and consent of Presidential nominees is one of the general duties of the judiciary in this body. The Supreme Court has upheld the Court of Appeals' advice and consent requirement for several nominees, and I am confident the Senate will continue to uphold it for these judicial nominees.  However, in the case of Judge Paul E. Baca, I believe the Senate should not follow the lead of the House in abandoning the Senate's advice and consent requirement when it comes to Presidential nominations. The Senate has had a long history of providing advice and consent for nominees, and we should continue that tradition.  Judge Baca was confirmed to the Federal bench in 2007. He is an outstanding judge, a respected jurist, and a law professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara. His qualifications to serve

Last year, I joined my colleagues in introducing legislation that would amend the Tax Code to ensure that the Internal Revenue Service does not inappropriately impose any tax burden on clergy, including requiring the IRS to hold an annual hearing on the IRS's treatment of clergy.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, there are things we need to do. The No. 1 issue in America is stopping the American people from going to the polls and going to vote on November 8 without stopping illegal immigrants.  I am going to support a bipartisan amendment that will add another $2.5 billion to border security, a million new agents to border patrol, more money to detain people in our airports, to monitor the crossings. I think we need to pass this amendment because it is a reasonable and necessary step to stopping the illegal immigration problem in America.  We know the immigration problem is not going to go away. The more people we have here illegally, the more likely they are to come back. So we have to do something.  I support the Durbin amendment because it is a reasonable and necessary step to stopping the illegal immigration problem

In Hastings, they won by 2,200 votes. In Washington, the Democrats lost by over 200 votes. That is the difference between the Democrat and Republican campaigns in the last election.  We have the same problem with the other side of the aisle, too. They do not have the courage to talk about it. They are so busy telling us they will take care of the middle class, and that is the problem.  In the last election, we had this difference in the Democratic campaign. They said that we were for giving the middle class tax breaks. Well, we gave the middle class tax breaks. We passed it

Mexicans and Americans both deserve our support in the fight against drugs. They both need to work together in order to fight against the very powerful cartels.  Mexico's economic problems are a result of a corrupt and out-of-control judicial system. In many cases, the government has failed to control corruption, and it has become a problem for the United States. Last year, over $3 billion in bribes were collected by Mexican officials, mostly in the form of kickbacks, which are effectively bribes for the production of drugs. There are several examples in my State of the incredible amount of money the cartels have collected from the American people in recent years.  Our efforts to combat the cartels have been

It seems to me that what the Democrats are saying is, well, they are going to give us a little more time, but they want to delay things and they want to cut back and delay and delay and delay and delay.  The Democratic leadership is telling us that they will do this if we pass the Schumer bill, and they are going to do this if we pass the Schumer bill if they are in charge.

The report from the State of the Environment report shows that the initiative has been successful in reducing the amount of asbestos in the insulation of over 250,000 residential properties. In the case of asbestos-contaminated insulation in Washington State, the amount of asbestos-contaminated insulation on the structures exceeds the allowable limits.

It is believed that some of these employees have been involved in abuse of the system, and are in the process of making these abuses worse.  Mr. Speaker, this is the wrong time to cut the rate of our health insurance. We must change the way our Government delivers its services, so that we are not paying our Government more money for the services it provides. We must also have a reform of our ethics laws to make it more difficult for Government officials to abuse

The USDA Grain Improvement Program was first established in 1937. The program was intended to provide a permanent source of food to rural communities that had been economically disadvantaged and in need of assistance. Since that time, the program has provided the assistance to communities that have fallen into two categories--those in need and those that have had an increase in population.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Simmons) for introducing this resolution and for the great work he has done on this bill and the War Crimes International League and the State Department Human Rights Commission and for his leadership on this issue in the State Department and the State Department Human Rights Commission in Texas.  Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today is an important first step in addressing a critical issue: The failure of the State Department to conduct its annual human rights reports.  As the chairman of the House Committee on International Relations, I have been extremely concerned about the State Department's policy of withholding reports on human rights violations, including the rights of U.S. citizens in Iraq and the whereabouts of U.S. military personnel in Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, Burma, and other countries in Southeast Asia.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, hard-working American families are paying a high price at the gas pump today for high energy prices and for natural disasters that could have been avoided if Congress had taken the time to address the serious problems with our energy policies.  The people I represent are watching with increasing concern as our energy dependence continues to grow. It is critical that Congress continue to work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to do so in a responsible manner. However, this is a problem that affects all Americans.  There is no question that energy prices have risen over the past year, and we are facing a new supply shortage. In fact, over the last 5 years, the U.S. energy consumption has increased at the fastest rate in over half a century.  As a result, the cost of energy for every American has gone up.

I rise today in support of this important legislation and in strong support of the Economic Opportunity and Workforce Restructuring Act of 2007 and in support of the time for Congress to act on job creation and employment in America.  This legislation contains the best bipartisan piece of legislation that we have considered to date in the 110th Congress, and I believe that it is one that will serve as a model for this new Congress and the future.  This legislation authorizes the Federal Government to make some $2 billion in funding available to States to allow them to make grants to businesses for hiring additional employees. In this Congress, the economic stimulus bill passed by the House and Senate both included an additional $1.5 billion for small business. The conference report that we have before us

federal recovery consultation

Another issue that has arisen is regarding the relationship between the legislation and the Endangered Species Recovery Act of 1973 which is law now and which Federal agencies should consult with the State Fish and Wildlife Service, and the agency which is conducting the listing of endangered species under the act, in determining whether to continue to require landowners who intend to keep their property from becoming subject to the listing of an endangered species. I believe that the Endangered Species Recovery Act, as enacted by Congress, sets forth criteria for determining whether the property owner should be required to maintain their property from becoming subject to the listing of an endangered species.  In the case of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Endangered Species Act, however, the law provides that the agencies shall consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service in determining whether the property owner should be required to maintain

The Voting Rights Act is the foundation of our democracy. I am deeply disappointed that we have not taken the time to do so.

Mr. President, my question flowing from what we have learned and the various issues we have had to address over the last several weeks is this is a new United States Government that is doing a new job for the American people and not Iraq and Iraq and Iraq Iraqi families, but it is a new United States Government that is doing a new job for all Americans. We are here today to address the jobs bill.  I do not think there is any question in my mind that the work that has been done on the floor of the Senate has been a work of dedication and sacrifice by all of our Members. I want to thank them all for their hard work.  I rise today to introduce a resolution that recognizes the important work that our new President has done in crafting this legislation and congratulates him for his work.  I have heard

But here is what I do know: They are not allowed to vote for people who have been investigated by the Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, I want to vote against the conference report. I do not want to vote for the conference report because it does not have enough pork, and it does not contain enough language on military commissions, on which I voted, and I would hope that the President would veto this conference report.

poor program medicaid 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal from the White House is a reverse Robin Hood program for poor Medicaid recipients. Under the current plan, if you're a senior, you're eligible for the full amount of Medicaid benefits you've earned. If you're a poor, disabled, or uninsured senior, you're ineligible.  It's shameful that a Medicaid program is being so thinly disguised as a voucher program. This Republican proposal eliminates Medicaid eligibility for most people with disabilities and allows for the expansion of the rolls of poor, uninsured senior citizens.  The new proposal also undermines health care coverage for Medicare recipients. Under the Republican proposal, seniors who get their coverage through Medicare will pay more in taxes and premiums. In my district, it is estimated that a senior would have to pay $20,000 a year in additional taxes and premiums under

Mr. Chairman, the National Science Foundation employs almost exactly the same number of people in the country today as it did when President Clinton was chairman of that agency back in 1992. It is correct that in the 1990s the administration cut the NSF by almost $100 million, but this does not reflect the fiscal realities of today's Federal budget.  As a result, the NSF, under the President's leadership, has grown by nearly 4 percent. It is growing in all kinds of areas, including a healthy and growing medical research program.  At a time when the budget deficit is growing, the National Science Foundation has become a force for fiscal restraint.

conference medical speaker

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time. Mr. Speaker, what we have before us today is the conference report on medical malpractice reform. As Speaker Gingrich said earlier, this is an excellent bill, one that is in the best interests of patients, doctors, and the law.  H.R. 3221 was passed overwhelmingly by the House last Congress. It is a noncontroversial bill that provides for the reduction of the amount of malpractice awards awarded by the courts. The bill also provides for additional review of cases brought by injured physicians to ensure that there is an adequate remedy in every case.  Mr. Speaker, there are many concerns that have been raised by both sides of the issue. I would like to focus on the ones that I have heard most often. I am sure that there are others who will address

I have been a strong supporter of child welfare reform since I first came to Congress, and I believe this legislation represents a significant step in the right direction.  This legislation is not perfect. It would have been better if the original bill was structured to meet the very real need for Federal child support enforcement.

government human state 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, last August, the world watched in horror as Burma's military launched an ethnic government state of terror on human rights groups, journalists, and human rights activists.  This brutal regime, led by General Than Shwe, used these individuals as political pawns in a long-term struggle for power. It forced journalists and human rights advocates to register with the government and risked their lives to expose corruption and repression.  The country's military was also the principal provider of weapons to the National League for Democracy, the People's Liberation Army. While the United States supported a political transition in Burma in December 1997, the administration continued to grant billions of dollars in military assistance, largely to build up the armed forces and help build support for the National League for Democracy.  As the election on May 25 approaches, I am very concerned about the

I said, ``If we were spending $500 million a year on this program, and it is going to go to the President, who can argue that is a worthwhile program?'' I asked the same question of the folks that are down there in the San Joaquin Valley. I asked the same question of my constituents.

Mr. Speaker, if there's been any good news on the Middle East peace process over the past few weeks I would have hoped it would be Palestinian Authority President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu agreeing to both sides compromise Jerusalem.  Now, I would also hope that this historic agreement could be fully implemented without violating the status quo in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which have long been frozen by their leaders.  But we can't trust the parties to put their cards on the table and risk losing the negotiations altogether. This past week the Palestinian Authority came to Washington to meet with President Trump and to announce their new plan for peace. The announcement that was made was that they would increase the Palestinian Authority's financial capacity by a total of $12 billion over the next 5 years.

The President's priorities also mean cutting back on vital investments in education, health care, and infrastructure.

president provide employers 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today is a very important amendment because we provide an incentive for employers to continue to put people to work in the United States of America. President Bush's tax cut legislation and the supplemental appropriations bill provide incentives for companies to create jobs. That is the thrust of the amendment.  My amendment creates an incentive for employers to increase the number of people who are working in the United States of America by making a down payment on their capital investments in America. This amendment provides an incentive to corporations to invest in their facilities, to invest in the infrastructure of their companies, and to invest in their workers. It is a well-known fact that the business community and the taxpayers of the United States of America are more than willing to provide an investment to stimulate the economy.  This is a very simple amendment

Today, all Americans are subject to the Federal Government's immigration laws.

But I think it is a mistake to give the Federal courts jurisdiction over this. That is a bad policy. It puts the Federal courts on an equal footing with State courts.  I urge a ``no'' vote.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In the first few years after NAFTA was passed, I remember my mother telling me that it would not take that long to get the minimum wage up to $4.50 an hour.

There was a big-ass herd of Soviet tanks there. We got to the base, and we watched as the helicopters took off and began to pull away from the herd. We knew they were going to be hit. But we didn't know how big.  I remember a lot of the young people that were there were too young to be alive, too young to be alive when we got there. I remember that very distinctly. But it was just

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe the 100th anniversary of Muir Woods National Historical Park in northern California this past weekend as part of the History Day Special Events Series.  Muir Woods National Historical Park, as the park is commonly known, is a National Historic Landmark in northern California. The park was established in 1932 as a special preservation area to protect, interpret, and interpret the cultural, historic, and natural resources of California's San Joaquin Valley.  The park's 1,200 acres encompass the last 50 years of San Joaquin Valley history, including the largest collection of surviving photographs and artifacts of the period. Visitors to the park will have the opportunity to view the undisturbed and pristine lands, including historic buildings, farm implements, and wood products, as well as the restored and original structures and buildings of

Madam President, I applaud the work of Chairman Dodd on this issue, as on so many others that we fight for every day on Dodd-Frank and all the other issues that the Record shows.  The Senator from South Carolina has been very patient with me over the years, and I appreciate his willingness to work with me to address this issue. He is absolutely right. The amendment does not put the program into a freeze, but it does not eliminate it. The bill simply makes a point of order that the bill violates section 313(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.  In other words, it is an appropriations bill, and it contains appropriations. It is a tax bill. It has to go through the appropriations process, and that is why I have introduced this amendment. I hope we can get the votes necessary to

Mr. Speaker, I would trust that the gentleman was unaware that Mr. Fitzpatrick also does not support the idea of the States to be part of a one-size-fits-all medical care plan that we all should be part of.

Madam Chairman, I rise today with this amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. As a bill appropriations committee and as the ranking member of the Army's Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, I have a real interest in the State of Idaho's continued investment in the R-1 nuclear waste storage facility.  This amendment would allow Idaho to continue its investment in this important program while making sure that the bill does not unintentionally limit our ability to make needed investments in national parks, wildlife refuges, public lands, water infrastructure, and other programs that provide a strong sense of place to all Americans.  This amendment would also allow Idaho to maintain its current level of participation in this program while ensuring that the funding that is provided is adequate to protect and restore the critical facilities.  Idaho's investments in the R-
