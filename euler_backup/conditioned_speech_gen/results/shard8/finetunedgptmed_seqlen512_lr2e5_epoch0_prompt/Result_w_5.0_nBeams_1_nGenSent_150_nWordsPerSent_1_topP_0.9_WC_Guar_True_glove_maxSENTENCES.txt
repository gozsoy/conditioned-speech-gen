I thank my friend and colleague for the time. Mr. Chair, since Congress passed the repeal of the ban on crude oil exports back in 1988, domestic crude oil production has soared. The industry and industry groups have been pushing to shut down the domestic oil industry for many years, but Congress has been unwilling to pass legislation in order to do so.  The Republican majority in Congress finally came up with a solution last year, but it was not enough. This budget resolution would simply freeze domestic crude oil production at current levels for the next 7 years while increasing domestic oil production by 15 percent in the coming years. The amount of oil currently produced in the United States would be frozen at 3.8 million barrels a day for the next 7 years. That means that by the year 2002 domestic oil production will be less than 2 million barrels a day

Mr. Speaker, this is quite an interesting debate that we're having, and I think it is a responsible approach that can help us all move forward with the economy and to make it more competitive and move toward a government that is not spending money that is going to the deficit.  Mr. Speaker, let me just close by saying that this bill was put together in a bipartisan way with the help of the Budget Committee and CAP and HELP.  I just want to pay tribute to our chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sablan), for all of the hard work that he did and what a tremendous job overdue in his leadership.

Mr. Speaker, the staff has given me four violations of the Budget Act, section 401, but this is just one violation of the Budget Act. And I have to tell you, the staff has done all the work, including the Budget Act editor-in-chief, as it should be. The Chair did a superb job of upholding the rules, and now I hope we can get the job done and get the House to vote on it.  But we are short three votes. Let us not forget one other issue. The budget conference report does not say that States' rights should be protected in protecting discrimination, including the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act.

It is interesting when we talked about returning to the pattern of balancing the budget but failing to provide a specific deficit reduction plan.  What you get is the deficit is increasing. It has been rising since the year 2001. In fact, if we look, this bill now has the deficit double from $259 billion to $370 billion by 2014. It has increased each year since 2001. It should

This legislation is necessary because taxpayer dollars and support for health care providers are currently being used to fund a costly health care policy that is harmful to our Nation and pharmaceutical companies.

Many of these Federal employees were asked to go to work for half what they wanted, while their spouses and children were pushed to the front of the line because of Government policy that the Republicans have been trying to eliminate for decades. Some of these workers have even gone back to their past jobs to work. The President is now proposing to cut the number of hours they will work by just 2 hours a day until they find another job but cook, clean, and help their kids while he keeps eliminating Medicare and Medicaid, and he isn't even trying to replace the failed War on Poverty.

This amendment makes a number of important provisions which would make it easier for people to get a piece of private insurance coverage for their children and grandchildren. It will give businesses and individuals the opportunity to market and recruit people who are healthy and fit in their marketplace.  First, this amendment protects preexisting condition exclusions for individuals. Every State has some form of protections for preexisting conditions. For example, Massachusetts has a preexisting condition exclusion, New York has no preexisting condition exclusions, and Connecticut has no preexisting condition exclusions.

Mr. President, the Senate has just overwhelmingly agreed we do not need the Boren amendment. That is what is so stunning about it because that is what the previous Senate did that came out of the other body but not in the House, and it was a different view of things than the way we get things done.  One of the things we need to get done is to get health care off the back of jobs. That is what the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Reid, has been telling us since August, this is a job killer, this is a red herring.  There is no problem in the President of the United States being opposed to trying to build these jobs in America, building these bridges. We should have done that back in June, too. That is why it was only OK that we made the short-

A new class of American criminals has emerged that will take advantage of America's neighbors, but not from the White House, but from our own intelligence agencies and our own law enforcement officials who will be hard-pressed to track them down and hold them accountable. Speaker Pelosi promised there would be a ``targeted strategy'' to combat this new and brutal gang war, and yet her flawed plan has failed to ensure a targeted and effective strategy.  The men and women of our law enforcement who made up this unprecedented task force on yesterday's television show, ABC, clearly made a mistake by hiding their true intentions when they referred to President Clinton's ``common-sense'' drug enforcement strategy.

Mr. Speaker, a ``tax loophole'' is a term that can be applied to anyone from the Clinton administration in 1993 until today. The objection is being raised because of something that is not covered by the law.  What is the IRS doing? The IRS now is suing any one of its branches of Government for $10 billion over misleading information in forms that the IRS was forced to provide because of a ``holiday'' that allowed those documents to be leaked.

First, let's take a look at the Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Act, one key piece of legislation that is still working its way through the Congress. It would act to provide additional resources for research and development into the effectiveness of spinal cord injury and their development. That legislation passed the House with almost 100 bipartisan votes, and it is one of the few law enforcement and public health efforts that we know of that has made an immediate and lasting mark on Christopher Reeve's recovery.  The concept of cervical spinal cord injury is still a mystery to doctors and researchers because it may involve damage to one or both of the backbones. There is no reliable test for the precise cause of spinal cord injury.  In 2004, before Mr. Reeve's accident, only about 5 percent of spinal cord injuries were diagnosed, and that figure has steadily

Mr. President, data has become a form of currency. Today, businesses and government are processing access to healthcare information through their healthcare provider networks for their patients. Although these services are crucial to providing patients with the healthcare they need, companies are not required to provide access to that information when their businesses are already sharing this information with government entities to improve the health and efficiency of businesses and government sector entities. Our Republican colleagues are now trying to pass legislation that would make it clear that a health care provider is indeed the same as Senator Collins, just as if they were completely different companies and therefore exempt from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  While I strongly support the bipartisan bill Senators Collins and Lieberman have authored, we also agree that healthcare and health information sharing needs to be more transparent, safer, and secure.

Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which would allow for the implementation of the authority provided in the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration Amendments of 1995 and the Transportation Security Administration Act of 2002 through the year 2002.  This is a step in the right direction and would allow the Department of State to support marine safety activities to help protect those who travel to our shores.  The increase in funding for the Department of State to be used for the increase in the authorized authorized strength for marine security operations as provided by this amendment has been a key part of the effort to develop the Department of State's multimilitar maritime security program in response to the security threats that face us.  This year, the Senate completed action on legislation providing for the development of the Maritime Security Program Enhancement Act, which enabled the Department to use

Mr. President, I do hope all Americans are paying close attention to this debate on the health care debate because this bill would make Americans' lives miserable and do so without providing needed relief to the many Americans who are currently uninsured. It is just a sad day when the Constitution is being used for political gain. This bill would create a national entitlement system, even though most Americans have been paying into that system for decades. It would require the Government to do everything in its power to make the Medicaid program insolvent.

Mr. Speaker, in January, President Obama took office while facing the worst economic crisis in his history and called it economic progress. Now he's going to work to take the economy back into jobs for millions of American workers and families. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act takes forward President Obama's recent efforts to ease financial crisis fears among American working families.  Under the Congressional Review Act of 2010, Republican legislators shut down the government and threatened the Treasury as part of a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Because they've never been to a single meeting of the Federal Reserve, they didn't know what they were doing when they forced the Senate to stop approving the non-existent emergency economic stimulus bill that, if passed, would have sparked a crisis on the floor of the U.S. House.

Mr. President, when Lavenia McCoy arrived in Bayfield in 1939 as new teacher, she also arrived as someone who was part of a movement that brought about a tremendous change in American education. The first program Lavenia worked on as a volunteer was at the school that is now school yearbook No. 11 in Bayfield.  Lavenia began her work at Mill Lake Elementary School and discovered, as a girl of five, that all she needed to do was to feel and read. Her determination to change education forced her to leave school at the age of 11.  It was through her persistence that Lavenia was called to active service in the military. This fight later led to a second and not insignificant career in the classroom. Lavenia joined the 1st Lieutenant's Corps of Cadets and later rose to become president of

No President has said that that would be his policy Minister of Defense Bob Gates said that his first duty was to his Nation and not to politics.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to speak today on the important yet under-documented role that the U.S. has played in the deterioration of the current crisis in Afghanistan and its possible potential to contribute to a better future for all of us here in the United States of America today. In no small part because of this important role our Nation has played in the development of this fragile peace agreement for the better part of a decade and indeed for an entire decade and more in that opportunity-building relationship.  The situation in Afghanistan is especially critical, with 20 percent of the world's poorest people either living or living under the poverty line of $1.25 a day or less.  I believe that the sacrifices that we have already made--more than 8,300 American soldiers in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflict alone--

It should not be in order to require the Department of Labor to consider all the costs and benefits of a particular proposed work requirement in granting certification and a favorable job opportunity for the worker with the least cost and in requiring the Department of Labor to make a judgment as to whether or not such work is serving the public interest. A requirement that every worker with no private benefits or privileges gain a favorable opportunity, regardless of the costs, without the involvement of the work force or a meaningful risk assessment must be rejected as contrary to the intent of this legislation and its supportive provisions.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 420, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act. The Chairman and I are proud to be an original cosponsors of this bill which cuts litigation costs for lawyers and claims investigators who face frivolous lawsuits and make sure every suit is investigated thoroughly and prosecuted.  This bill will reduce frivolous litigation costs by eliminating three methods which have been exposed as low-balling. Instead of using a standard settlement amount which every person pays, the bill doubles the amount of time to process a claim, making it worth approximately 40 percent more to each individual lawsuit.  The new standard rate for civil suits applies only to attorneys and not claimants.  This bill would lower the cost of litigation by at least $46 million a year, making it a welcome improvement.

Mr. Speaker, let me just say that it is no wonder, then, that the women's rights groups have come out so strongly against these tax cuts for the richest Americans, and they are right because this is a tax cut that benefits the wealthy and hurts the working people of this country and social justice issues. The majority leader has supported these cuts in the past, has asked the Speaker to bring them up for a vote in the House and to allow the majority party to consider the proposed changes as well.  The Women's Association, which has been fighting for women's rights in this country, opposes this tax cut for millionaires. And the AFL-CIO has just come out with a letter with 200,000 signatures. They are telling the majority party to take these proposed tax cuts seriously, to give these people the real deal, and to

Mr. Chairman, I would like to make one other comment on the compensation criteria, which some of us may not agree with, the Chairman makes that he has the highest percentage of all the members of the committee. That is true that we have not passed legislation that would change the bill as proposed by the committee, but I know that he has this high standard that I think is appropriate for him to act in the appropriate manner. I do not think that it is appropriate for the chairman to dictate to the chairman the decision about whether that person should be allowed to do a certain number of perks or not.  I do hope the chairman and the managers of the bill, as far as I am concerned, will work out that compensation criteria so that we, in fact, give that one group of Members, not the chairman, but the chairman

Mr. President, currently American seniors enjoy Medicare health plans called cost contracts. Under legislation I will introduce today, there will be no more Medicare cost contracts for seniors on the Medicare Program as we provide Congress with the authority to reform the current Medicare system and to do so in a fair and just way that will improve the lives of all American senior citizens and help to ensure that senior citizens will not end up with an additional Presidential tax.  Medicare costs have reached $12 trillion, including the cost of deductibles and copays, and rising, which will now likely be $30,000 for an individual. This enormous increase in the cost of Medicare, coupled with the fact that Medicare costs have increased at least $25 billion a year in recent years, has caused senior citizens to feel helpless and to try to access prescription drugs at a higher

We saw this today when Speaker Pelosi unveiled legislation that will double the size of the Federal Government by limiting the money that can be spent on the bill even though most Members did not support it.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to second the thought that the Speaker just made on the Speaker of the House's budget when it comes to the deficit that is here today, that the Republicans have decided that they want to balance the budget in one year rather than for all this country to be able to understand what we are doing to solve the problem.  The Republicans are attempting to cut Medicaid, Medicare, and the bipartisan compromise here is, when there is a problem, they want to reduce the burden of the problem, they want to cut the spending in the program. They want to reduce the tax burden for the American people.  I did a voice vote on the Madigan-Cohen bill on Medicare because there is a block grant, they are cutting it by 5 percent.

No; the choice is not limited to that.

So the American people are being attacked by their government on the issue of unions; and we are not all Republicans.

I recall, however, that what actually happened was we in Congress did not raise Medicare by the same amount.

The people of Delaware can pay for all the health care they want, in a way that works, but not taxpayers in Kentucky, taxpayers who do not want to pay for health care. Equity means that opicil patients should be paid for the treatment that they need, not for Medicaid providers.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to inform my colleagues that today, the President transmitted his budget to the Congress for their consideration and approval. While this is a good first step in the right direction for the recordkeeping efforts that were made on the bill, the President has made a number of important recommendations that I will be working to enact in law, which are clearly in the national interest.  I share his vision of the role of the Federal Government in empowering individuals and empowering families by providing the resources to ensure the health, educational, and economic development of our country. Unfortunately, the President has made serious missteps in advancing this goal. This budget would deny some of the most basic American families the opportunity to control their own destiny by cutting funding for Federal child support and welfare assistance programs that are critical to support a healthy, well-

I will make a couple of remarks about the Medicare part A and B program that will be in play at the end of the debate. The Medicare part A and B will be paid for as part of a new Family Tax Cut bill. As the Washington Post has said, this bill will cut $400 billion from the Medicare budget. It will cut about one-third from the $28.8 billion a year Medicare trust fund has been paying. So I hope we will vote on it at the appropriate time.  I have to rise on this point because I know the majority leader wants to go home and defend his actions last week with regard to his latest gambit on the so-called Medicare

Mr. Speaker, S. 1789 as passed by the Senate on February 7, provides for relatively simple adjustments in the prohibition on the use of Indian railroad bridges and the establishment of a moratorium on the expenditure of funds for construction of bridges to facilitate the operation of the Indian Railroad System. The restoration of Indian rehabilitation and reservation status is of particular importance to Indian tribes and other Indian citizens.  The Senate bill fails to do what the amendment which I am offering, and which will be voted on today, will provide for. It repeals all of the language in the Senate bill which prevents the funding of any bridge project on Indian reservations. The purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to support Indian rights by prohibiting the use of Indian railroad bridges to facilitate the operation of the Indian Railroad System. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  <|endoftext|>

I come to the floor to speak against the Coburn amendment. I know the good Senator from Oklahoma wants to oppose the amendment and he is quite interested in the issue, as well as the issue of the State budget that the amendment seeks to reform to do for States what it did for programs in the amendment of Senator Warner. The amendment would cut back Federal support of the State budget provision in the legislation before us, the so-called SCHIP bill. It would destroy much of the work that has gone into the introduction of this bill, including our comments about the dual-support funding.  I am here to speak against the Coburn amendment because, as a Democrat, I am deeply concerned about what has happened to the Federal Government of the United States in the last couple of years. We know it is going broke. We know

The expiring tax relief I am talking about today includes the marginal rate cuts and the $5 million that will go into the Congressional Budget Office to do a better assessment of what the tax benefits of this legislation would be and whether those Federal expenditures will bring a lot of savings to our Federal budget deficit. But I would also ask Senator Kennedy if Senator Biden's amendment would be good enough bipartisan for you and this Congress?  orsiuucapguas if we vote for the Baucus amendment, marginal rate cuts would be the law of the land and then, $5 million at a reduced rate of 0.5 percent would be set aside for CBO's actuarial analysis. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Our country is a better place if people come together and work toward a common goal.

Mr. Speaker, in politics, today, we make points by making good sound bites. I wonder if the President will follow this same rule making practice in the course of his hourlong speech today in which he compared the Republican bill and the Republican budget and, in effect, won the battle.  If the President wants to sweep the Senate away, there is a new enemy.

Republicans are craven in their obeisance to their health industry patrons who are so generous in giving money in this campaign, and in their weakness of reason. I will just point out to them that they have been that way before and this is not an exception that they have been able to maintain that they are keeping government interest on subsidies for these insurance companies to continue providing subsidies. If they continue to do that, then they are a political class that is most likely to adopt policies which will continue to leave those who do not get health care on a bad level.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This is what a $500 minimum level will mean to seniors in New Jersey. This will mean seniors losing preventive care. This will mean senior's of New Jersey will lose access to family planning.

Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the freshman class of this Congress, it certainly saddens me that this body continues to watch President Clinton set himself up to fail in the difficult area of Iraq and that the Democratic majority is still unable to act on it because of the deeply held beliefs of the Democrats who have elected to run this Congress.  The administration and Congress represented by President Clinton want the job of our reconstruction of Iraq to begin in Iraq, and I would hope that that would be accomplished in a way that would be as American as Walter Cronkite, and as bipartisan as the House Armed Services Committee. This is an area of great expertise and great pressure.

Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation, with the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. McMillan] and others, that will create a national registry of hospitals that deny care to all patients in Federal health care programs.  The fact of the matter is that Medicare has over billing systems that are based on medical claims.  Those claims will have a higher Medicare deductible for the physician who comes in with a claim and says that Medicare benefits should be reduced to pay for the care of that medical condition. So the ethics of Medicare and the system of fairness that we have here is undermined when we take in money through this program but then we put the moral cart before the horse in order to pay for that medical care.  There are patients in these hospitals who do not have insurance. The government is now in charge of deciding whether or not the Medicare program can

What we have done is allow them to continue to say we are doing nothing but creating jobs because they have the Government already on record as saying this and that. And if they are going to continue to say that on their own, then we need to get on with the debate and see if we can find the airlines, our favorite airline, that have to borrow money to pay for the cost of air travel so they can provide more international routes and on that revenue side of the equation we have a huge number of jobs that they want to have.

Mr. Speaker, the budget that President Obama sent to Congress yesterday contained a number of new initiatives to help the poor of this country as they go into their final years of new lives in this new world of new opportunity. First up in the new law was the new New York City Department of Homeless Services initiative, which will bring many thousands of people into the government-run system, and would establish all sorts of new services to help them get off of addiction and get off their bad habits. Next was the new welfare reform initiative that will increase enforcement of welfare laws and customs.  Now, Mr. Speaker, the problem with all of these new initiatives is that they do not end, Mr. Speaker, poverty entirely. The entire welfare system, Mr. Speaker, is a chainsaw doing little to help the poor. Poverty only exists

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my colleagues from Texas. This amendment would add billions of dollars to the Federal debt over the next decade. In addition to this number of dollars in Federal spending increases for the next decade which would amount to billions more dollars over the years to future Congresses and administrations in Congress and subcommittee chairmen, this amendment also cuts Medicare by $4 billion over the next 10 years and would cut almost $100 billion in economic development investment and State funding for Florida over the next 10 years.  In addition to those cuts in funding and development for the economy which the industry and the entire Nation would suffer if this amendment were to become law, this amendment cuts State spending for health care assistance programs by over $2 billion over the next 10 years.

The 1997 goal for reducing the contribution of money to health care costs is achievable without raising the Nation's debt limit and without raising the deficit of the United States Department of the Treasury by any significant amount over the next 5 years or the following 10 years.

Mr. Chairman, hard-working American families are paying a high price at the gas pump today as energy costs continue to increase and energy prices continue to rise.  These high gas prices have resulted in the elimination of hard-working small businesses that supply hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs across the country, and gas prices have also reduced our natural gas supply.  That's why I've been working with my good friends on the Energy and Commerce Committee, including many who are hard-working small business owners and the members of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, to develop a strategy to reduce the cost of the American energy economy so that small businesses can continue to hire, expand, and grow.

Madam Speaker, these debates are great. It gives everybody on both sides, including the Democrats and the Republicans, a chance to hear a well-thought-out and well- speaker-pleasing political agenda and for the Democrats to show their support for and investment in programs that actually do benefit and serve the people of the United States and all those who live in these three areas and also including the lack of debate and understanding of the differences between what we do to help seniors and what we do to help the wealthy.

Mr. Speaker, where are our friends this morning from the other side of the aisle? Is it because we are unable to reach an agreement on the budget so the President can sign the budget because they do not have enough time to do that in morning business?  If you really think about it, let us say you could run for office today and say you want to spend your days and not get things done because you want to get things done so you can get some money out so you can get something done because you do not think bad things are happening in Washington because you are a Republican who has spent his life in the Texas congressional district where we were recently elected and where Texas is known for its oil rig accident.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the chairman once again.

That economic employment in the United States would grow tremendously and create tremendous opportunity for new jobs for all of our citizens in our country.

I understand that that was the deal we had before the deadline was set out.

Mr. Speaker, I have been misled. I thought that Members of Congress were supposed to agree with the President on a lot of things. We were supposed to agree on some things and not agree on other things that they wanted to say that are really very important to Members of Congress, because this is a matter of political resolution and having Speaker Pelosi in the White House and the President having the ability to make a decision that the American people will support him or her for that job. That is not what is going on here today and why so many people boycotted that bill when it came to the House floor.  In fact, this was a very, very transparent attempt to pass a budget resolution that would permanently roll back the reductions in Medicare. The budget resolution, as reported by the Committee on Rules, gave the President $6 billion

Madam Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal from the White House is a reverse Robin Hood approach to health care that will allow an insurance company to charge more for people because they are poor and the insurance company that provides those policies will not provide them coverage at all. The program in Medicaid will actually add to the cost of health care for lower income, sicker people by roughly $230 per person per year.  I support eliminating this unfair law, but while the Republican plan does not address our nation's drug crisis, I think we need to look at what is already in place. Just a few months ago in Miami, I visited the Belle Isle Correctional Center. In this prison, their current drug treatment unit, is less than 20 percent full, and yet their $1.8 million drug rehabilitation center is already at capacity because they do

It is a serious bill that not only will cut the costs of prescription drugs for all Americans but also help more and more Americans cover medical bills.  I commend the committee for finally agreeing to include $8.5 billion in new funds for prescription drug benefits. This includes $12 billion for low-income families that currently get no drug benefit, such as prescription drugs for children, pregnant women, and seniors. Cummings and I worked with Republicans and Democrats on the committee to try to come up with an amount that would meet the needs of both groups.  Unfortunately, the committee did not reach an agreement on how to fund these changes to the drug benefit. We are now debating the bill before the House

The cost of high fat and added sugar is also extremely high because it is difficult to control or process the unwanted side effects of these products, especially when they are in our children's own foods and the final product we consume often contains the same high levels of sugar and fat as a background in our food supply. This bad news is becoming increasingly alarming for American families.

We should be able to work across the aisle to increase the level of Federal funding for these increases so that those rise with the economy and make the standards for our water even higher.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, it is an opportunity for me to thank those who helped put this bill together, that is all we have to do in this Congress to not make such a hard decision and this is the time to do it because this is not the time to do it in a United States Senate that has been too soft on the energy issues and too soft on the issue of the environment.  Let me read some of the comments from the conference report. It says: ``the Committee recommends that the commission commission the following consultative panel: general industry interests, governmental interest, environmental interests, and consumer groups.'' That is about it. In all seriousness, it is a problem of the United States.  The reason it is a problem is it is not a good Federal policy to continue, like we have seen at other times when we

Mr. President, last August, the world watched in horror as Burma's military launched an ethnic cleansing campaign against a stateless people who had refused to become its subjects. The government systematically slaughtered almost 3 million people, and it used human rights and labor protections to deny people basic civil liberties. The people of Burma are desperate for meaningful political change. Millions have left the country. The people have suffered, and their leaders have surrendered power. The authorities have shown no concern for human rights. The regime once again began to use martial law to control public and private life and to frighten citizens. It is an authoritarian regime that wants to silence every voice of opposition and dissent.  Mr. President, the government in Burma must honor its obligations to its own people. The United States has an economic stake in allowing freedom of thought and expression in Burma.

Mr. Speaker, if there's been any good news on the Middle East peace process over the past several weeks, it has been the Palestinian Authority ending its blockade of Israel and being allowed to resume talks between Israelis and Palestinians regarding Jerusalem. It is time that the Palestinians end their own blockade that they have imposed on Israel over the past 2 weeks and allow Israeli officials to come to the negotiating table and negotiate peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The sides have known this to be a matter of mutual respect and interest for 4 years now, and they must realize that.  The Palestinian Authority is a majority controlled party that is committed to human rights and democracy. Their continued blockade of Israel is undermining those ideals. It is a tactic that they have utilized for 4 years to confuse the American people, and Israel should stop it now.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to read a sentence from a very short statement made by the gentleman from California which he made just a few minutes ago about the action that the chairman of the Armed Services Committee is taking and the need to make this budget the kind of thing that he would be supporting and so we are going to have to be very careful in this long debate as to whether we have a 2 percent growth in defense spending.  But I think what the gentleman from California is trying to do, what the gentleman from Oregon is trying to do, is make sure that he is actually moving this forward with our military and that he is doing it in a way that is balanced and that has a realistic, rational and responsible defense that provides a sustainable base for the future so that our troops will have the equipment

Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] for his leadership and standing for environmental protection throughout the country. I also would like to point out that there is nothing more important in this House than the national interest. The Members of this House are not just concerned about health care or education or an increase in the minimum wage or higher taxes or tax rates or any of those issues that yield results in a way that benefits our Nation, but they are also concerned about the health of the planet. They are interested in the health of our planet and we should never allow anybody to trick us into believing that they are doing something about it or that somehow they are really doing something about it.  This bill, again, is not enough; it

In addition to my first amendment, which would provide the Secretary with the discretion to consider cases for the eligible individuals in States that require assistance as defined by the government in its regulations or money in its accounts--this would allow the Secretary to make decisions for the eligible individuals based on the criteria provided by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to determine eligibility for such assistance and impose reasonable requirements for providing such assistance, and would require a minimum of one certification and a limitation of $10,000 for each such certification. This would give the Secretary discretion to consider cases without subjecting the eligible individuals to further Government scrutiny.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, we are all familiar with the hundreds of millions of dollars in favors to Wall Street that happened over the last 30 years. But there is one area of the economy that the Wall Street superwealthy and their corporations really care about and that is the middle class of North Carolinians. We need to allow small businesses to compete in a free marketplace that favors small business, not big business and not big Wall Street.  Small business is the engine of our economy. A recently released study showed that retail sales of small business products increased by 52 percent last year. Our solution to this problem is to put a bigger emphasis on the middle class, help small businesses compete for our trade dollars, but provide a capital gains tax credit for dividends. For this tax credit to be fully utilized, we must pass a capital gains tax

Mr. President, the proposed cuts we are talking about will devastate Indian country. They strike as much at Indian schools and at Indian people as they do in any other State or Nation. They will cut schools for thousands of Indian students every year. They will cut money from our millions of eligible low-income families. They will drop $3 billion from funds that we already have to continue Indian country with higher education and higher percent of students than any other State, Nation or territory in the Union. These cuts in education for disadvantaged children are a disgrace. I hope that our colleagues will oppose this as well as the immigration bill, H.R. 2, which I must say is a very popular piece of legislation.
