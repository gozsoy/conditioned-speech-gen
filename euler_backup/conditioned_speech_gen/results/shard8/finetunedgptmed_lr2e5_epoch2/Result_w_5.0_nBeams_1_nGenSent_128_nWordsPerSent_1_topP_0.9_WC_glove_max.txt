Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule because of its fundamental conflict of interest. It appears that the Republicans are here to protect Big Oil so that they can move ahead on their agenda of destroying Medicare and Social Security.  When the Bush administration announced the extension of the 8 percent gas tax for the next 4 years, they did so with the sole purpose of letting Big Oil off the hook. At the time they left it up to us as part of the Democrats to reject them from extending this benefit and take the necessary action to end the tax in the fall of 2003. Now the Republicans want to do exactly the opposite, only this time

First, it reforms bankruptcy law so that it makes it easier to allow businesses to stay in business and then move them on to new locations and so forth. Second, it reformulates the concept of the value of an individual's assets to a person in order to guarantee that the value of assets will not be artificially lowered in bankruptcy proceedings.

This amendment was submitted by the Senator from New York in the early morning hours of January 22 of this year. It will not only serve as an example of a committee's constructive use of the limited time available for consideration of the subject, but will also provide the appearance of congressional support for the provisions of the conference

I want to highlight the focus that this bill puts on science education in the bill. With just a few simple reforms in this legislation we can provide the opportunity for State and local communities to have access to a robust array of science education resources to meet the needs of our children and to gain an understanding of the power of science in the education of our future generations. The bill

We know we have a legitimate need for health insurance and coverage for those that cannot find one under current law. We have also heard a lot of talk in recent days about the problem that we face with our healthcare system in this country.  Our Nation's healthcare system has been in a state of disrepair for several decades. The health care that is available to the American people has deteriorated to the point where many times nothing can be found as a job or as a house in our neighborhoods.

We are now in June and have heard about numerous Federal efforts to address the health care of Health Care Workers and their families.

It is important that we do everything we can to avoid further unnecessary and burdensome regulations of these public lands in New Mexico and the country as a whole. In particular, I want to focus on two areas that I think are the most important investments that this bill makes toward the preservation and the vitality of our Nation's forests. I believe that the broader public involvement and participation in our forest policy must also be ensured. I believe that by facilitating the dialogue between conservation, states and the

The Chair has outlined the situation as provided by this bill that Senator Byrd has raised and as articulated by Chairman Johnson from the other body as to what it means when you take a $16 billion cut in the crime control program, the provision that we now spend about $5 billion a year on the enforcement program on criminal aliens in this country and you put that on top of the other 5-year entitlement programs. So it is a well-established reality that this is going to have a serious impact on the Department of Justice in terms of

I cannot help but be particularly impressed by what he said about our health insurance reform legislation and the fact that it was put together in a bipartisan fashion because it worked so well when he and I were in charge of the Senate Budget Committee.  I wanted to point out one other thing because the Senator from New York made a very nice analogy about health care being the similarity of that the various diseases are. Let us remember the early stages of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. At that point the disease was real and the alternatives were pretty much limited. I

Mr. President, the work that is left to be done on the SBA must include including a better understanding of how to support the issue of conservation in our financial services. The authorization for the National Park Service for the next decade will be nearly $4 billion less than the previous year's funding request and will include fewer than 8,500 paid employees for the next decade. This is simply unacceptable in light of the demand we have for Federal agencies to protect our Nation's natural resources and protect the lives and well being of Americans.  The failure of the National Park Service to support the conservation needs of Americans is rooted in the agency's policy of creating permanent

Mr. President, today I am going to come to the floor to talk about what is perhaps the most important issue facing Americans today--the prescription drug benefit and the reason why we need a vote today on the President's law and the reason why we need the leadership of this body on that issue so that we can get on with the work of the people of this country in a bipartisan way that has not only been standing up to drug companies and keeping them from doing what they want, but also making the seniors, working families, businesses, and children who are going to be under this bill better off. That is what is at stake in this vote.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. 437, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 1997, which passed this Senate on November 2. In doing so, we have shown the courage of the Republican Party in changing Congress and the administration as it relates to taxes and taxes policy, tax cuts and tax cut proposals, and how much the American people are willing to put up with. As the first Republican in almost two decades to make this legislation his agenda, I believe it is long overdue. President Clinton and Senator Dole should take note and this Congress should put some significant time and effort into addressing the issues of

Last month, President Obama stated his administration is putting a big enough bet on manufacturing and good-paying jobs that we must work together to make the challenge of recruitment, retention and retention of an aging and talent-short work force a priority. I have listened with great interest to the President's comments, and I am eager to see where we go next. This week will be a big week in America. We will get the administration's report on its proposed economic recovery

Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation before us today is a key step in that process by saying to the Iranian and Syrian Revolutionary Guard that they must be held accountable if they continue to cross our lines and to their future plans.

The gentleman is correct that there is a problem with the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, and that is because the Department of Homeland Security has included many programs in their budget that do not make sense. In fact, in 2006, for example, there were $11 billion of added money for military missions in this area.  As the gentleman knows, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Boehlert] and I introduced

Some have a tendency to ignore the very purpose of this legislation: the ability of the United States of America to serve the needs of the American

As an original cosponsor of the bill that would allow the USMCA to go forward on the House side this week, and most of the legislation that has been put on the House side to allow the USMCA to move forward in the last year has been bipartisan legislation. There has been some political action on both sides to say that we should not move ahead on this, and that is what has been going on as we have watched this come to a head so much in the last year and a half.

This was an impressive presentation as he outlined an impressive record of accomplishment in his 21 years on the job.  Additionally, I traveled with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce to the Turkish Embassy in Washington, DC where I learned about the massive impact that Turkey's relocation into the European Union has had on our economy.

Mr. Chair, as the chairman of the Rules Committee, I rise in opposition to the Lower Drug Costs for All Act, also known as the Lipstick Rule. I do so because we must be clear that this legislation is not intended to open up an all-or-nothing policy for the entire Medicare program. This program is run by and for the whole American people. However, the Lipstick Rule, if put into law, could allow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other agencies to move away from current practices to the benefit of only a few special interests groups. This would result in significant cuts to coverage for millions of patients and our senior

This great Nation should not be burdened with the role of the do-nothing Congress because of the activities of the Senate and the House of Representatives that allow the American people to ignore the needs of our most vulnerable citizens and pass tax bills that do not represent the needs of the American people.

Mr. President, I have long supported the efforts of the House of Representatives to reform the Federal child welfare system and also to make Congress more responsive to the needs of abused and neglected children and others in need of this assistance. The Child Welfare and Institutions Reform Act of 1996 does much to promote this goal and has been a major victory for the children in need of protection and services in this Nation. Despite the tough vote taken by the House last week to defeat the Senate amendments to H.R. 4175 and the close of the last debate on the conference report on that bill, the House has taken the first significant steps in promoting the successful work of

Mr. Speaker, the national debate about the treatment of illegal aliens has been grossly unfair and inaccurate. It has made it clear that those who consider themselves ``legal immigrants'' have no legitimate claim for access to benefits and should be treated as second-class citizens, subject to an automatic threat of legal action from the Federal Government if they do not comply with Federal law. For these reasons, this debate should not be necessary.  In fact, it should be emphasized that immigration law is not one thing. It is the body of federal laws which govern our country, which are enforceable in both Federal and local court by courts of competent jurisdiction and which ensure the

Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor with the Senate's vote to override the President's veto of the bankruptcy reform bill and to address several issues that I have discussed with the President during the last few weeks.  First and foremost, what the President's veto of the bankruptcy reform bill is and how it will affect the bankruptcy system we have in place today is a negative issue. It is a positive issue in that it is a temporary fix that gives the Secretary of the Treasury authority to lower interest rates to a level where we do not have to borrow money to make sure that the new bills we have passed during the first 12 months do not
