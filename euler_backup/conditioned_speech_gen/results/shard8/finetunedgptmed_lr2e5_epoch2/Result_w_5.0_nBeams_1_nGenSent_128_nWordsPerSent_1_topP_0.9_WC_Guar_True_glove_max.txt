I encourage its adoption by the Senate today and also give special attention to the public option commission which I have offered as an amendment to ensure greater competition among health insurance plans in the long term in order to retain the competitiveness of health insurance plans across State lines and to create a public option commission to take over the role currently performed by private insurers.  I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Collins for their help in introducing this bill and urge its adoption.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

At the same time parks, judiciary, and agriculture programs for victims have been frozen for 4 years while the House is still refusing to allow a vote on a simple, direct amendment to protect victims.

Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman being here for this debate, for his chairmanship of the full committee. And let me make it clear that I do not take the position that the EPA should be given all authority in the Federal Government acting in a particular fashion. In fact, I think all authority should be available to the local government as appropriate and necessary. And that is what this amendment is designed to do, to have the State and local community participate, to have local, State and tribal governments participating in these issues, to facilitate their cooperation and to have them get the full benefit of the overall regulatory process.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the underlying bill, the Small Business Amendments Reauthorization Act of 1996.  This legislation is not just important for the men and women we represent in this House of Representatives. It is relevant to the economy as a whole.  Reauthorizing this bill will bring jobs to small business owners who are willing to sacrifice the stability of a predictable government and who will more effectively allocate taxpayer dollars. This is a critically important issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

miners day today 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, on Monday the Committee on Foreign Relations will meet to hold a business meeting to consider the following nomination on today's calendar. The nomination will be the ranking member on the Council on Foreign Relations for the next 5 years to be the first person from the Foreign Service to be the first day of session before the Senate on Monday after leaving the House of Representatives. The name of that individual will be confirmed today in the Senate by miners. I hope that will not be necessary and that the House will confirm the nomination.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and this crime bill that we will consider this year in the very near future that will go down in history as the last crime fight in this country where we continue to have the burden of 40 million Americans being locked up for the rest of their lives because of the crime that is committed on our streets.  The crime bill passed out of this body provides significant reforms that will protect the rights of our people. I think the Members on both sides of the aisle who supported this bill believe that the bottom line, because of these tough enforcement measures that we enacted as part of the 1994 crime bill, will be

The unanimous decision of the Connecticut Court of Appeals in the New Haven Municipal Record noted the Connecticut Court of Appeals' respect for the Constitution and committed them to uphold that ``to the fullest extent possible, to the highest ideals of justice.''  Justice Sam Ericson's ninth term of supreme court review was unusually long for the Connecticut bench, and distinguished only by his impeccable intellect, his wise counsel and his ability to deal with complex legal issues.

Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Beilenson) having assumed the chair, the following Members were necessarily absent today and were therefore unable to attend the proceedings of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union: Mr. Weldon of Illinois, and Mr. Weller of Pennsylvania.  There being no objection, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the colleagues' bill, H.R. 5893.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman from Wisconsin's amendment and in support of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Act of 2003. The men and women who serve our country need and deserve our support and our support for this young Nation in the war on terror. We are being asked to send a force to a war that has yet to be declared by the President and released from the congressional restraints.  This amendment prevents us from going into Iraq until the specific date that the President has declared a war of necessity. The truth is that even with the years of hesitation about this war, the President and the Administration have the authority

The income gap in this country was effectively not filled in part because of the generosity of the American people. It is because of a Government that is unable to properly handle the paperwork and paperwork related to the individual tax code. What we need to do is restore it.  No
