Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have spoken about the need to invest in public housing in this country. As a new member of the Budget Committee in the 103d Congress and also on the minority side of the committee, I have been more than impressed by the work and support of the public housing reform coalition, which has been such an inspiration to me as we have worked on this issue for many years now. The coalition has shown real leadership and leadership that I think has been critical in moving this forward in a very bipartisan manner and in providing a better public housing system for the Nation and for the citizens of this country. It is something that we all should be encouraged about and which is a matter that I believe all of us should be able to support and support in an effective way and

Mr. President, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program has successfully carried out activities and programs aimed at improving the lives of children. The program utilizes coordinated and innovative methods of providing counseling and services to families affected by foster care in Minnesota and other communities across the country. This innovative approach has provided many families access to the services they so desperately need. In the past several years, this program has also helped to strengthen the local child welfare system by providing enhanced services for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.  The program in Minnesota was created to address the growing number of children without a permanent family in Minnesota and around the country. Many State jurisdictions now provide a variety of services through the same State agencies or foster homes they provide to children living in adult foster homes, but the Minnesota operation is unique in that it places these services in homes where

I think it is an example of why the United States of America should continue to be the bastion of economic freedom for our allies.  The second part of the gentleman's question is whether we could end the bailout of Greece because of the debt of the country, whether that is going to be short lived or whether it will last for some time to come. As the gentleman knows, I think our allies, both the European Union and the country of Greece itself, are supporting the continued bailout of Greece

So Marion put all her resources toward becoming a social worker.  She got her first job by volunteering to work with a young man who had been kicked out of a halfway house. When he asked her what she would do if she got the job she wanted, she asked him if she could always tell her how happy he was being in a halfway house and had a stable job. She felt so happy.

The immigration system is being run as one big way to protect the United States government against illegal immigration and foreign governments from enforcing America's laws. Rather than make legal immigration reform an important priority in the Senate, Democrats have promised amnesty and promise to support any legislation that gives amnesty. This is shameful.  The immigration system that we have today is just that--amnesty for people who came to this country when they were 13, 14 years old and then overstayed their visas.  They did it out of American heritage, on American soil. They want to give them amnesty. That is the bottom line.  This plan to expand our borders will ensure that a significant number of illegal immigrants will be in the United States after they get their American visa

I appreciate the gentleman for telling that compelling story. All of us have stories like that from time to time in our homes and working families. The thing that I always remember as a teenager and as a Member of Congress is that it was a time when the government told you that you could not have any independent political activity because that was something that you could not do without the government. That is not the case today.  It is just because we have been given a green light to be part of a political party that this money is going to be found under the rubric of the so-called political action committee that is called the Republican Party. That is the word that you hear so often coming from the other side of the aisle about how they are somehow changing the rules of the game, this is an attempt to change the game

And the Democrat approach to this has not been only false for one thing or another, but it is not going to work.

The Food Stamp program is no more than a payback program for those people who depend on it for a minimum amount of income. It just does not work that way.  When you vote for tax breaks for the rich, it does not help people in this country, and it is a recipe for major problems when you look at this broken system in America and the price of health care in America.

So, frankly, it's unfortunate that we're going to be in a recession with regard to private money being spent on stimulus, because, again, this is not the way you're going to raise a good economy. And, again, those people who are opposed to this have proven it.

I do want to say, as the chairman knows, the Judiciary Committee, as well as the House Judiciary Committee in the 104th Congress has passed many pieces of legislation dealing with the issue of Americans' rights, as well as the people that have constitutional rights as well as their civil rights. There is nothing more important than the first amendment to this Constitution, which has been changed almost 400 times in this country and many times in this session of the 104th Congress. It is absolutely critical that we have this act and that the other provisions that have been added by the other side of the aisle make it possible for them to do what we see them attempting to do when they are on the floor and try to ignore what it is that we are about here to do in the first 100 days of the 104th Congress when they are doing their campaign

Mr. Speaker, this is one more bill designed to punish the Federal workforce and to make Government worse. There will be no new budget after the conference bill is passed by the Senate, because the Senate was more than willing to reform the Federal workforce, but they did not want to pass the conference bill which, by itself, would terminate all Federal employees, including me and all Federal employees, if we do not pass the bill to continue to serve the American people.  I wish I could vote for this. I would like to see the conference bill passed. I would like to see, even though my friend from Illinois, the chairman of the Federal Workforce Committee, was not here, we could have passed the conference bill, or we could have just worked this out.

As I will tell you today, I believe Judge Kavanaugh would have struggled in the high court because of his clerical track record, and this wouldn't be an argument he would have had difficulty passing up.  I know we Republicans will be doing our best to keep his record, because I believe the American people want an honest and decent Supreme Court Justice.

Unfortunately, the issue of most-favored-nation status for China has not been part of the debate as it should be for a number of reasons. Let me first address the most important of those reasons, which is the need for some practical, trade-oriented economic remedies to improve the working conditions of the Chinese people by giving the president more tools to force Chinese goods into the United States market.

In the last two decades, this innovative process has emerged as a key to the success of many of the Nation's largest and most highly-motivated companies. Since the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the economic leadership that has been the basis of so many of our Nation's most successful companies has been based on the principle that employers should be the decisions makers when it comes to the hiring and firing of their employees. Last week the Department of Labor released the Administration's Wage and Hour data for June of 1997, showing that retail sales in the United States rose by 12 percent during the month of June and retail payrolls increased by more

Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply asks that, in the spirit of this bill and the chairman's commitment to a fair pay bill, in addition to the $2 million specifically included in the bill for working women, we also include $5 million for the Department of Justice so that funds can be used for civil asset forfeiture enforcement.  The sad fact is that the department has, under the guise of civil asset forfeiture that funds come from the Treasury, raised the forfeiture limit $16 million. As a result, the Department of Justice is now spending more on its asset forfeiture program than they were on any other civil asset forfeiture program in the last 12 years.  This is an abuse of power and does not justify using the full weight of our Government's resources to restrict citizens' civil liberties.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

President Bush and Vice President Cheney are preying upon the American people, calling it a democratic response to the issue of terrorism. We have learned that the administration may even be directly responsible for the brutal murder of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. It will take years to determine the extent of this administration's involvement in the actions of the current President and Vice President of the United States, Cheney and Bush. But the facts are clear to all concerned that this administration has supported the use of torture and that it has also actively promoted the immoral practice of post-conflict statements in which representatives of the White House admit that they authorized torture of detainees when President Bush was still in office.

However, Americans still face persistent underpayments of about $30,000 on average and are on the verge of another historic pay raise if Congress fails to act by the end of this Congress. This year has been particularly hard on women in the workforce, many of whom work the longest hours of the Nation's working women to support their families and to keep up their full education and careers. Americans continue to make progress in closing this wage gap but are still facing many of the same pay gaps that exist in their counterparts in many other countries where the Government controls some or all of the wages in this country.

That is not tax increase, that is a net tax increase of $3 trillion over the next 10 years. Now, the plan we are considering does not touch Social Security. It does not touch Medicare.

We are the most open economy in the world, and yet our trade deficit with China is not what it should be. The fact is that when it comes to the cost of goods and services and products that we import, we get more for our trade deficit when it comes to China than we do when it comes to a number of countries around the world.

Gas prices make our roads, transportation systems, the delivery of goods and services and the energy in our homes unaffordable. For too long, the oil companies have had access to the profit that is being made at the expense of taxpayers.  The American people deserve better. They deserve to know the true cost of gas before they are asked to make tough choices.

This is common sense and it is a basic sense of law to which every American should be entitled and the public should be expected to abide. The clear issue before us is not whether Federal employees should allow the military to have abortions, only whether there should be any consequences for a conviction that they may support abortion in the case of rape and incest.  The Senate in previous years did not debate my amendment when it was offered because of what I consider to be unfunded mandates, namely the Kennedy amendment to the Defense of Marriage Act.

What this amendment simply seeks to do is make a point of order against the second-degree amendment that would protect the American farmer from the impact of this proposed ethanol mandate.  As is the case with all mandates, this proposal could cause the elimination of an important farmer's job in the next fiscal year and it would likely lead to the loss of a very small amount of farm income that a farmer might obtain in a larger farm the next year and a larger trade with the United States.  It would not only result in a large reduction in farm income but could potentially cause the loss of over 1 million jobs as far as the transportation sector which is the most important way of

What we will do is take the same current program with the same name that does not provide any benefit and add it to the emergency assistance program that will result from the Interior appropriations bill that was passed last week. That is the bill that will be passed and will be sent to the President so he will have the authority to use it for the disaster relief and other needs of our States, localities and communities. We will make it the emergency economic and water-related programs for our State, and I urge all Members to vote for that.   NAACP's Black Caucus is proud to join the chairman in support of the Skelton amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This important act will put the Endowment on a path to success. It will make it the most valuable Federal agency that we have.

However, I am deeply concerned that some of the provisions of this amendment also apply to the District of Columbia Government and do not in any way apply to the other Members of the House of Representatives or the State of Washington. The intent of this amendment is to provide that no funds may be spent to modify or expand an existing building or to make other improvements to any existing facility unless approved by the congressional authorizing committees of both Houses of Congress. But there are some parts of the legislation which require the expenditure of funds from Federal property and from other Federal agencies to complete construction or to carry out various activities that would not fall under the description of existing facility construction or an existing building improvement.

It is important to also retain vital Medicare services for our seniors and to ensure that Federal payments are made to the States and tribal governments that have fiscal responsibility for our Medicare program.  I believe that we need an amendment to make it more difficult for Medicare recipients to obtain health care services under Medicare, but this bill ensures that Medicare programs are not affected in any way by changes in Medicare benefits, so long as those benefits are maintained in a reasonable manner to provide quality health care for our citizens and

procedure senator vote 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the Senator's amendment would change the procedure for every Department or Agency in the Government in which that Senator serves to consider a proposal under executive order if the President of the United States voted that the request be favorably submitted to a committee of the Senate under paragraph 5 of rule XVI or clause 5 of rule XXI and did so within 30 days before it was proposed to be considered by the committees of the Senate. This change would mean that the Chair would not be required to wait for 30 days before applying any interpretation of section 505 or any provision of law that might be required by the procedure under the amendment. The change in the rule, as modified, would do two things:  First, it would put the President of the United States in a position of exercising his statutory authority to act on a request if, prior to the

Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act. Congress has only passed these bills in the past two Congresses and Congress has only acted on the most recent when an appropriations bill is in session as it is this time of year. In the past, Congress has not made this difficult process more difficult for responsible officials to act in the best interests of the public. Despite the best efforts of House Republicans in the past and their consistent call for delay in this critical time, those same Republicans have already made it even more difficult by making the regulatory process harder to manage.  This bill would drastically cripple government's ability to respond to our national emergency threats of natural disasters, natural hazards, terrorism, and many other events. The bill requires agencies to go through the cumbersome

Many of the lessons he has taken from his life as well as the lessons he has taught our country since the days of his first term as a Senator have continued to come from his work as a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary where he has spent the last 20 years as a distinguished scholar of government and the past 40 years in the U.S. House of Representatives where he has served as Congressman

This amendment establishes a bipartisan proposal to address the long-term funding problems associated with this bill for the Community Health Center Program.  Community health centers are designed to provide long-term care and help consumers move toward a high-quality, reliable health care delivery system.  These centers are one of the least expensive, the least time consuming ways for patients to obtain health care.  The McConnell amendment would reinstate funding for Community Health Centers that were eliminated in the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture appropriations bill.  The Senate Agriculture appropriations bill deleted the funding for the Community Health Center Program, which does not allow Federal funds to be used to extend eligibility or capacity, or pay administrative or other expenses for the provider.

Now it is my understanding that if they are an agency that is subject to those laws, that they would have to comply with those laws with respect to their participation in those programs and that those programs would not apply to people who are out of the country or that they would not apply to people in the continental United States of America.

I am not a politician, but even if that is the case, Mr. Speaker, we have the option to reject this bill because of the lack of government transparency. We can continue to waste taxpayer dollars and ensure that the people that we are sent to represent are providing better services and better lives to others in their countries.

Madam President, for those Americans who believe the Senate was going to have a debate on the President's choice to be the next Secretary of Education, you were not paying attention when Republicans and Democrats refused to debate any of the issues that really mattered to you and all Americans who cared about the education of our children.  So let me offer some facts that many Americans were not aware of, just a few: The House of Representatives Republican freshmen plan to use this House to pick the next Secretary of Education, a Member who most Americans do not care for and would have a significant impact on your kids' education. Most students and families would not be able to afford to attend a private school in my home State of California if it were not for a special education student loan program that the Republicans and Democrats here in the Senate have not passed.

What a good example of how we are dealing with America's need for nuclear security today as the world works together to work through the challenges in the North Korean regime and the problems in the region in the world in which we live now as a consequence of the agreement we have worked on on the one hand and the strong desire to work with the President to assure we have the most secure nuclear weapons stockpile we can possibly have in the world on the other hand.  With all due respect to the Senator from Georgia on this subject, what are we talking about with that subject?

Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment which will ensure that no funds are spent on military training for international terrorists and the activities of the People's Republic of China and the other Communist-supported countries of the region as well as all members of the Northern Triangle. Since the U.S. has been providing support to these regimes for decades, I do not believe it would be in our national interest to fund their activities. Furthermore, we have known for some time now that this funding was unnecessary and that other nations would be more than happy to provide these funding to the International Court of Justice in the Hague on these same accusations. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Debora Lee Velazquez

Mr. Chairman, the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program is a youth development program that works in conjunction with the the Department of Education to develop and implement an integrated program that provides training for skilled high school students to be eligible for a high school diploma at the postsecondary level. The program provides ready and active high school students with opportunities to compete in the National High School Deverancy Challenge and a range of professional and career education courses.  The program has consistently had good attendance and graduation rates. While there is a need for more students to be enrolled in the program, I believe it is an excellent one that should be maintained in future years.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In March, I also supported the school choice initiatives in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 as well as the most recent reform of student aid that the House of Representatives passed last year and signed into law in March of this year. These measures are important because they have brought attention to the desperate need for change in America's education system.  In Texas, the fall reading program was terminated because the administration knew that the program was not going to work.

They are only defined as a nonprofit academic institution under the Federal charter for educational programs.  We are now in another large Federal bureaucracy, which is not a charter school, but is in charge of education and is running the Federal schools.

CBO estimates that this bill will substantially increase the deficit by $11 billion. As you know, that cost estimate has been published on CRS Web site. Mr. President, the cost estimate reflects a wide range of estimates that the Congressional Budget Office has made since last year's debate. At that time, CBO estimated the legislation would increase the deficit by $15.7 billion, far more than CBO's recent estimate of $5.8 billion. I would remind my colleagues that CBO's review was completed in the fall of last year, and prior to that there was no information available to substantiate the Congressional Budget Office's conclusions.

This proposal is not balanced by itself because we need $1 trillion in new tax breaks, and I will also point out that in return for this kind of tax giveaway to the wealthy, the Republican budget proposal increases spending and taxes in the same proportion as the Republican budget proposal.  The proposal would add $9 trillion to the national debt by 2002, $3 trillion more over the 10 years under President Bush's plan, which is certainly not balanced by itself.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor and support H.R. 4772, a bill to honor the life and legacy of Amilcar Cabral of North Korea.  Amilcar was a man of uncommon resolve and courage. He was the only American in the country to die from a North Korean oil rig explosion in 1953 and was so proud to be an American when he left his home nation in the early 1980s. I met with Amilcar last summer and asked him to comment on my remarks about this bill. He said, ``If I wanted to do it myself, I would have done it. I felt it very personally that we have to keep the pressure on Pyongyang and stand by the people of that country to ensure that the Kim regime will never have a nuclear weapon.'' This was very moving. Amilcar was a brave

This year is especially significant because on September 13 Greek Independence Day, the Greek people have begun a long line of celebrations to celebrate and celebrate their unique traditions and history.  Mr. Speaker, it is not that I wish that we could all return to the days of an arrogant ruling class and wantonly abused the Greek people. It is also not that I wish that everyone would leave here just as quickly and return to their lives here at home.

I have been supportive of the administration's request for a 5-year freeze of the number of first-strike systems so that they will not become so complex and too expensive that we have to end them when they become available and at the end of their useful lives. This approach has also been agreed to by the House and Senate conferees and the President has committed to support the House-passed position for the administration's budget request for next year. It is only for these reasons that I believe we must make some slight but significant cuts in our domestic missile defense programs for next year.  As Members will

In fact, according to a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it would create more than 7 million new jobs.

The reality is that there is much more to be done to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign sources of oil and provide energy security for our Nation and for the world in general.

I happen to believe the H-1B program is one of those programs that expands jobs and creates a lot of American jobs, not just at the end of the month when we come to work in the House, but all over this country, not just at the end of the month when we leave our offices.  The GAO study shows that almost half the work force in America is not part of an industry. Of the workers in America who are part of an industry, 22 percent are out of work, they're unemployed, and they live in a rural area.  This is an issue of making sure we have open borders and an open rule of law. We need to make sure we pass this bill, get it to conference, and get it signed into law.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

And as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has reminded us and repeated many times on the House floor and before the Rules Committee this week and the other day, we could not pass an increase in the debt limit without not passing a law that the American people knew about or believed to be necessary to keep the government functioning and to get the economy going in order to keep the

We have seen in this Congress, first in the House and now in the Senate, the triumph of the American people in the interests of their great country.  One of the most deeply felt and effective lessons I have learned since coming to Congress in 1974 is that working people and small businesses are the first to be hurt and the last to get the biggest bang for their buck. Yet under the old Republican policy that would have us invest in our Nation's social programs over and over again, America has been so

It is time Medicare doctors stop playing political games and get Medicare patients the care they need. The Medicare Drug Price Reduction Act requires Medicare beneficiaries to pay Medicare drug prices that are no higher than the highest prescriptions Medicare pays in the private sector. For Medicare patients who need Medicare drugs, Medicare pharmacies have long filled Medicare prescriptions at discounted prices. The Medicare pharmacy discount system incentivizes doctors to choose Medicare patients when Medicare prescribes and patients pay Medicare pharmacy premiums, thereby decreasing drug prices in Medicare beneficiary pharmacies. There is no better way to protect Medicare beneficiaries' Medicare drug costs than to allow Medicare beneficiaries prescription drug discounts from Medicare pharmacies.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Appropriations be discharged from further consideration of the Senate bill (S. 1552) to provide for the issuance of nonimmigrant visas to members of the Armed Forces who perform service in support of or as agents of the Government of Lebanon or members of the armed forces of the Republic of Lebanon, and for other purposes, that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the bill in the House, be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements appear at the appropriate place in the Record as if read.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida?  There was no objection.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 131,

I know the gentleman used to use to talk about welfare as if it was a pension and that all this money we are giving them would go to this program, and it is not. The reason that this is so important is that that is what this does--that it allows more money to go out of the coffers of the States than we have in the program as a whole. I know that the Senator from California is not going to agree with that.  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the States put up a large blockage of any kind of reform of their own type, and I think I can give you one example of a State that made a decision that they did not want a large number of dollars going to this program and, instead

It is important that we take care of the millions of public housing projects and that we fund public housing programs with as much money as we can get our hands on to help people of all backgrounds, some of whom are for a little longer than others. That is what this legislation will do. This bill provides housing support for some of the most vulnerable of the American public in the face of an economic downturn. This legislation provides help for people at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder that the American people sent us here to reform, to reduce their poverty and to put them back on their feet again.

Mr. President, this amendment is a commonsense reform that allows the Joint Committee on Taxation to begin the analysis of tax expenditures that would provide Federal support for the nonprofit Black Entertainment Television network before the Internal Revenue Service has had a chance to do an analysis and make a determination on whether this network has engaged in or has not engaged in an activity that is inconsistent with a right that is guaranteed by the Internal Revenue Code to which this legislation would apply. It is simply a commonsense amendment that will save the Federal Government money and that the administration can support. I urge its passage.  The  advisable use of funds from H.R. 644, the Senate Information Exchange Act, [S. 1200] for ITC.

Thank you. Mr. Chairman, contrary to what Republicans have said on the floor, the Republican budget actually increases taxes on working people because it increases the cost of health care and gasoline and food and energy as well as college loans, not because of what is included in the Republican budget resolution.  Mr. Chairman, the Republicans stand for the rich. They stand for a tax break to the wealthiest people in this country. Unfortunately, they stand for poor people in this country, millions of people, and those who are out of work. They stand for those working people who have no health insurance and pay more taxes than do the people who are not working at all.

After years of partisan politics and bickering on the budget, a deal is close. Unfortunately, we have lost hope that the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution will be balanced in 7 years. Some budget analysts predicted it could take as much as 6 years to balance the budget, which makes no sense to me and to President Bush and to the American people. A year from now a 6-year deficit projection would be enough to cause the Republican majority to abandon the deficit reduction plan and replace it with the $93 billion in tax cuts that will be in the Republican budget for the last 4 years. To continue to lower the debt by this amount of money would make a mockery of the Republican budget and the American people and cause

Mr. President, according the Rand Corp., only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the United States goes for health care. At the other end of the spectrum, only 45 cents of every dollar spent in the United States pays for the major problems that cause crime. Health care, in fact, accounts for only 17 percent of the crime problem, and medical liability claims account for another 17 percent of the crime problem. Health care accounts for nearly 50 percent of all crime insurance premiums. Health care accounts for about 37 percent of fraud insurance premiums.  Insurance premiums are tied to premiums paid by insurance companies for health care coverage. The fraud insurance premiums are tied to premiums paid by insurers for health care coverage because fraud insurance premiums take insurance away from patients who have insurance and premiums paid by insurance companies for coverage.

Mr. Speaker, Congressman Tom Lantos was a giant of a man, an inspiration to all of us on both sides of the aisle. As I said earlier, the House has lost a giant of a man, a very worthy Senator who spent a lot of time in my district and was a very good friend of mine and a very valued member of the Democratic Caucus and of the Ways and Means Committee. He will be greatly missed by our country, and that is a fact.  I rise today in honor of Tom Lantos, one of the leading figures in the Republican Party in this country today who will be sorely missed. His years in Congress were one of the most effective in the history of this Nation and made a difference for the American people for decades to come.  It is also a sad commentary when we hear this week about

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in reflecting on the life, accomplishments, and contributions of President Ronald Reagan. One of America's greatest and most universally admired figures died yesterday in his great State of Colorado Springs after a long illness. Ronald Reagan was a giant among giants. As our Nation goes about this great work in which we take part over the next few days, I take great comfort in the words of the American political and media elite. These same people today feel they can lay their lives down as two points of salute to a man whom they did not know but loved and respected and admired in their own society and the world in which they live today. His lives and the lives of their families have been taken, and his names will continue to be added to the pages of history, and we can forever be indebted to him

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996. I support this legislation because it provides a modest increase in funding for military construction, and because it provides $50 million for the Families with Dependent Children program that is crucial to the health and well-being of the children of military families and to the long-term development of our military personnel. The conference report is also a reflection of the rise in demands on our military as a result of defense sequester. It allows the Navy, Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force to provide out-year operating funding for Operation Desert Storm and Desert Storm Special Operations Command for the years 2000 through 2002.  It also restores $2.2 billion for funds for programs which fund mental health programs for servicemembers and their

What the Senator from Maine says is not true, and it is not that important to me because the State of Maine is next to New Hampshire in so many ways. It is not a State that is as large as New Jersey and New York would be if it were not so close to New Hampshire to be covered by this program. It is the only State that does not have to approve of plans to close an office and use some State funds to move some people around to other States so the benefits of these workers in Maine

I will explain to the Senator the problem I find with her amendment. I think the Senator is exactly right. There is the deal that we entered into with all of our State Medicaid programs back in 1982 that the States get to buy into this system and that they can control spending. The State plan as it currently stands would be $5 a year, which is for the first year, $8 a year or $10 a year. The amendment of the Senator from Iowa--and she talked about some of the reasons that the Senator is going to cause those funds to go up, those funds would be taken from the current entitlement programs that are spending more and more and more money for those States.  I think the problem with the Senator's amendment, of course, is it doesn't touch Medicare, it doesn't touch Medicaid.

There are millions of dollars in this budget agreement for the Nunn-Lugar program.  $7 billion more than what the President asked for for this program. This is a vital program for our Nation to provide expertise to the farmers, the fuel experts, the people who manage the food supply and the supply of petroleum reserves in the country and the ability to be able to give them assistance to ensure that those countries that are not investing in their own resources have the opportunity to do so

So this is a bipartisan effort on our part in the committee to ensure that those people who are going to be called on to be the President's team are taken care of by the other body in the House of Representatives,

But having said that, if we can ensure that the bill does not allow the taxpayer to pick which phone company is to be taken under this legislation, I would hope that in conference the Members of this body would allow that legislation to go forward.   renters; tenant pension plan, requiring disclosure; taxpayer access to bill, making sure the bill applies only to the phone companies which charge the telephone bill, not to any others.

Because they are going to not go with anybody else, we will have to go with ourselves.  So I would say to my friend that let us do something that is fair. Let us do something that is honest.

There are some great private companies who will have great chance to win these contracts and that should not come out of a State Department alone. It should come out from the private sector. That is what we are really looking at here today.  In the transportation area where a lot of work is done in the Department of Transportation we are in some cases competition with the Federal Government. That is one of the many areas where we are trying to have some civil and equal opportunity in doing that work because that is what is needed for public transportation. There is no other way to describe it than that. The DoD needs private sector labor to do these very important jobs that

When every nation of the world follows our lead on these important issues of peace and security, we have the best chance to win world peace and stability and bring about more prosperity and security for future generations of Americans and world citizens.

Mr. Speaker, some years ago in a notorious political murder case, the accused relied on his right to an attorney to obtain crucial evidence in the trial that led to his conviction. Now Congress is trying to repeal this right in order to hold elected officials accountable for corruption in their private lives and judicial processes.  At the time this action was taken, Republicans in Congress were attacked for trying to attack law-abiding citizens for their convictions and for exercising their First Amendment rights. The prosecution of this case was conducted without the help of a judge who was routinely being tried as an enemy combatant or terrorist and charged with treason and espionage by law-enforcement authorities.  It is appalling that the Republicans are trying to attack these legal protections for law-abiding citizens in order to promote the Republicans' extremist, judicial agenda.

We can, and should, provide explanations of where we're getting this kind of access to information and how that would prevent future abuses.

If the Senator from Arizona will forgive me, I would ask one more question through the Chair on this because this is the third time the Senator from New York has been to the floor. When we last had the same question from the Senator from New York on March 8, we were told that this is a very complex bill and it would take several years to resolve all the issues that have been raised about this proposal which I have supported for years. Is the Senator aware of the fact that there are more than 100 Members of the House of Representatives that support this policy? If the administration continues to give this the benefit of the doubt as it is today, it is my understanding that we could have this on the floor as early as next week if the White House does not continue to maintain the position that there is not a problem before us

Madam Speaker, it is very apparent, I think, to everybody out there that is seeing this Congress that what we are all working for and that is the very same thing we were going to try and help out, because the Republicans and the Democrats were trying to work together to make sure that public lands were made available for everyone, including private property owners, and, unfortunately, I think we have really broken that spirit here tonight.  So what we have here tonight is a so-called homeland security amendment, all over again. This particular amendment is being brought to us tonight under the guise of supporting public lands and making sure that the Government of the United States not only owns and manages those public lands, but also has the ability to take care of them.

I supported the amendment that passed the Congress in 1988 to provide $2 million for this purpose and that also served as the subject matter for the international Conference on the Malthusian Population Issue in 1992. There is now a strong bill pending on the floor to allow this agency to issue an effective and up-to-date Clean Air Act, in the event of a major violation of existing air quality standards that would compromise public health or the economy in the United States.

It is simply how much money seniors get back in the form of their Medicare prescription drug benefits after the program is reformed. The bill that we have before us will take care of that by bringing down costs for our seniors and allowing Medicare to say to Medicare, ``You are paying more than we anticipated you would be spending; we have gone from $6,200 for a family of four to now $4,700 for a family of four, and we have ended up with a program which will cover more seniors than we thought

I thank the gentleman for leading this important discussion tonight because it is critical that we have a proper discussion about this House and the people who have chosen to leave this body to be in this position of power for the people of this country in January and that we have an open and honest debate about these tax issues and the fact that the current Senate has not yet taken up any of the 20 or so most serious proposals that have been brought forth that actually make sense for a very serious issue that they are now turning away from this week and into next week, and that is the issue of Medicare and the fact that there are 10 different proposals and the six that they have brought forth would in fact do an awful lot of damage to this program for the many senior citizens in this country that have already paid the cost and the cost for these

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama, for the wisdom he has given to what is an outstanding and important statement that he just made on this floor. The Senator makes the point in his speech that we ought to get the public to be able to make an informed choice about their health care plan and then maybe we can have a change in the way we do things in this country. That is the issue here on the floor of the Senate and in the health care debate in this country and that is the issue that I hope will be settled before we begin to take the policy decisions that we will take on this bill that it not be open and in the open and transparent for the American public to know who is supporting what in the health care debate of this country.

Mr. President, America's greatest asset is its people, and what makes the American population unlike any other in the world is our political culture.  I am one who has been struck by the American people's enthusiasm for the political process and the free exchange of ideas. This spirit has allowed for dramatic change in America since the Nation began its 10th century. It has given reason for hope and this optimism is what has allowed America to accomplish so much over the past half century. There have been more than enough studies about America's democratic tradition to fill the newspaper. There are many things Americans don't like about their country but they are right. Many Americans have great disagreements about political behavior but they are right. It is time we begin to accept these disagreements and work together to build a better America.

The first of which is that the majority leader would not support any effort to address this problem in the budget because his desire was to have a 10-year budget that the Congress could adopt and that the President could negotiate in good faith. But what the majority leader has not discussed is his desire for a date certain in which the United States Government would be on the hook for all of these debts that are not made by the Congress. So, basically, the President is saying to the people of America, if you pass any of the policies that we have talked about today, we will pay the bills. We will not pay for an extension of

This responsibility is available to all Senators and those who do not come from the Judiciary Committee. It is what it is all about--making a proper decision on nominees. In order to do that we should take judicial nominations in a responsible and public way, and we should have the ability to determine whether the people of the United States should be hearing from the President when those nominations are being considered.

It is the first health care reform initiative of this Congress in the last 20 years that has been opposed by every single group that has ever voted in this body that supports it. This legislation is aimed squarely at the program of private-sector plans that is most often the subject of consumer litigation and the bill would repeal it totally. So this proposal is designed to do exactly what Senator Brown and I have been trying to do for 20 years.  What is at stake here is that 90 percent of the public and 90 percent of the private-sector

Catherine has the most serene family life that I have ever seen and has been a role model for all of us to follow and to aspire to be like. She worked so hard all of her life to become what she is today. In the middle of the last century she and her family were living on a farm in Iowa when she was asked to work as a domestic servant for the Federal Government as part of the Social Security program in the States of the Union. She never expected to take that job because her mother had already lost her job at the time she applied for it in the early 1930s. But she took the job and managed it well

We had in the DOD authorization request a study which indicated that there was inadequate leadership in DOD leadership in areas relating to military readiness and maintenance, basic intelligence requirements and intelligence products. In that study it indicated that the military intelligence community must work with the Department of Defense and the Army Corps of Engineers in terms of efforts to assist this operation in order to ensure that the continued investment in this effort is not undertaken for those dual-use programs.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask whether Congress can raise itself to the standard we set for ourselves and the American people when it comes to the budget and public service.  The line-item veto allows the House to act as a check on the President of the United States for the billions of dollars that are spent without ever having a chance to read the bill or to look at the benefits attached to each dollar spent. The line-item veto is an important tool that must be used by all the Members of this House in order to keep the programs working for the American people. There are some things that we cannot do without the line-item veto that the other body has not attempted to do. Yet this is a standard that we must, so I want the rest of my colleagues to understand that we cannot raise ourselves to that

Because of the subpart A account that the bill will cover in the year 2002, we are not in a position to spend additional funds from an account that is included in the Department of Defense or by other appropriation for research and development of a project in the year 2002. It is for that reason that we need the President to issue a budget for that particular account to allow us to pay down a cost over the life of the bill.

Mr. President, much ink has been spilled the past few years over the threat of climate change, and it is appropriate for Congress to take a strong stance against it, and act on it now if necessary. That is because we can prevent a costly new standard of living and future generations that are truly our own. Indeed, we must do so if we hope to reverse the disastrous effects of global warming that we see around us.  If we are serious about climate change, it is imperative we act now. This is because it would only take action if greenhouse gas emissions stay above levels that would reduce the expected growth rate of the Earth's average temperature over the next century. If carbon emissions go up and stay above levels that would allow that temperature to go below the preindustrial level by a minimal amount of time, this could effectively avert

That bill would exempt the many small business owners in the business community from the alternative minimum tax on 2010 tax returns which would have been triggered by the passage of the tax bill from House to Senate. The committee found that this would amount to a modest reduction in the bill for the vast majority of small businesses in the United States and the ability of these businesses to expand the employment in the future and to expand their tax base and grow their economic activity.

Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I do support the gentlewoman's work and the amendment in the sense that we ought to look more at providing a grant program. I think a grant program is important in terms of how much the opportunity is going to be on the table. But this is a program that really is a bipartisan initiative in my district where it has worked very well for a number of years. It is a good initiative to have in the portfolio and is consistent with the majority leader's minority view.  I thank the gentlewoman for offering this amendment to have this study done so that we can fully understand what it is that is going to work best. I hope we will support it very strongly.  Gailey is correct that we are going to be coming to the floor next week for consideration of the Senate bill,

Mr. President, since 1994, the U.S. Government has provided tactical aerial intelligence assistance to the governments of Iraq and Afghanistan to counter military efforts of both the United States and Afghanistan to reestablish or maintain stability in Iraq and Afghanistan and to help those countries become more productive and effective in their efforts to implement effective and peaceful reforms in both countries. For over a decade now, we have provided these counterterrorism measures primarily with the support of a small contingent of our military personnel. To date, this military security assistance is worth $30 billion, nearly a third of all the spending provided by the United States in the war on terrorism and a significant portion of that funding supports our efforts to protect the safety of the American people and our Nation and support the efforts of the men and women who keep our Nation safe and have done so with great distinction.

Five years ago Haiti's poor and country-tourists were left devastated as well as the country itself devastated by the earthquake which hit more than 3 months earlier on April 16, 2010.  As a result of yesterday's earthquake, now over 3.5 million Haitians have lost their homes, 11,400 people have lost their lives, and millions have suffered serious injuries and loss of livelihood. There have been countless reports of property damage, displaced persons, and other devastation. I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging the thousands of innocent Haitian citizens who have lost their lives in this dreadful tragedy.

There is so much that is going on in this program that I just do not think we can allow this to go unchecked and run unchecked as it has in the past because it will in time lead to it being cut by all our allies and, in turn, that would be a serious threat to our national security.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, more than half of the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans today for 2001 are for the upper 5 percent of Americans, those making over $100,000 a year. The wealthiest among us will get a $270 billion tax cut this year. They say the middle class should not be affected. The Tax Policy Center says the middle class will see an average increase in their taxes by about $10,200 a year. That is the middle class that we should be concerned about. That is the people that I represent, not those that I represent or those that the Speaker represents in the Republican Conference. They ought to be concerned about the people of America rather than the well-connected of this country, but the Republicans have chosen to take a small tax break for the people at the top of the economic scale that give the

Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of coming to the Congress in 1987 as a special Senator from the great State of Washington where we were in the midst of this great red revolution and we got this great thing going on here in this country where we were starting to make a difference for the people of our country. And we did make a difference for a lot of reasons not only the one you just gave me but for the good of this country and the long-term health of this country.  In the very short time I have been in this body, the Republicans have captured the Senate with only one exception. But it will not be the last one in the history of the United States that this Congress will be held hostage as we try to set a process in place for the people of this country and for our country to

Mr. Speaker, this is a frustrating time in Washington. For the first time in 17 years, this Congress is getting down to a businesslike manner instead of a fun-house approach which is why the other body has come to the floor and acted quickly to deal with what really needs to be dealt with. For the first time in 18 years the Government is operating because both House and Senate Democrats came together and said we have to do what we are supposed to do.  I think the important thing that I want to talk about is that on this side of the aisle we want to keep our promise. We are trying to make sure that we move legislation forward so that we cannot wait. We do not want to wait until January 1 and then January 4 when the Speaker and I will have to come back and explain to the American people why

For the past 6 years, Congress has been negotiating new and more long overdue legislation to reform the Social Security Program. The result is legislation that will be available to the American people today that will benefit both the taxpayers and beneficiaries of our retirement system in the long term. This legislation will allow the program to operate more efficiently and with less Federal spending in the future so that we can focus on the short term needs of

Absolutely. The one thing that we have learned is that when people get concussions, there is a chronic course of disease and is generally long lasting effects, which makes it difficult to determine the extent of it. This could be a big part of that, because we know that if you spend a year in a school system that has one that has high levels of activity and where you can expect some of the players to get concussions, then that could be the source of those concussions. That would explain why the time that is necessary to evaluate those players and take proper steps to prevent that will not happen if we keep making it so difficult to prevent those from happening. The fact of the matter is the way in which this system operates under current law is that we have institutions that spend a lot of money to train and monitor them and to

We will let the Internet Tax Freedom Act expire on Monday, February 5. That will put the Internet Tax Freedom Act on a time track that every Member of the House should understand and understand quickly because we are trying to get it done now in this way. So we should have a chance to let our colleagues know what we are doing.

Despite being very much aware of threats to the Nation's elections, he remained silent.  That same month, hackers took the efforts of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Presidential nominee and inserted a backdoor back door into the organization's servers. While these efforts compromised sensitive information from Democrats, no Republican was directly at risk.  But during these next few weeks, a new attack surfaced.  According to media reports, the Russian Government was behind the targeting of voter lists from Democratic and Republican candidates during the 2016 Presidential election. This was the most critical election security breach since the Democratic National Committee's email breach in 2016.  In a short period of time, our Nation was attacked by foreign adversaries

Mr. President, in November 1948--that was 1 year after my birth--President Harry Truman issued a proclamation which declared the State of New Hampshire to be the ``third State of the Union and the second State in the Union where women are now admitted to the legislature.''  It was not until about 1960--during the Roosevelt administration--that New Hampshire was one of only six States with one State house of representatives. In 1958, New Hampshire joined the ranks of other Commonwealths where women had the opportunity to join the State legislature when the Senate created the office of Speaker of the House of Representatives.  Despite achieving the distinction of having only one State legislature, New Hampshire has long enjoyed the respect and admiration of its citizens for its commitment to State government and Democratic principles.  Just last weekend--at the end of the Democrats' delegation's whirlwind 10-day

Madam President, I would tell my good friend from my neighboring State of New Hampshire, we have tried to be very cooperative with him as we have not been on the floor in the past but we have had a very bipartisan effort to try to find a way to get an agreement to move toward sending us some of these bills where we can really take a good look at them and see where the way we are going to go from there on that would be productive in terms of bringing us the measure that we are looking for. It has been a good working relationship.  But having said that, I will take some time today to respond to the comment of the Senator from Massachusetts, and then return to the matter of continuing to work on a solution to the various agreements we have here in the Senate and to try to move that bill at some

This legislation is good public policy because it is the first step toward providing more certainty to our pharmaceutical companies in the area of whether they can export to countries with a ban on the export of a good. This legislation will provide that the Government has the ability to order a company to take a course of action to change that course of action and would be a benefit to the hundreds of thousands of American companies that rely on foreign markets to export and to which this legislation would provide relief

Minimum wage legislation has been a priority for over a year, and I have given it high priority, as I have given everything else that has come to the floor of the House of Representatives in the last year and a half or the last 3 years. So what we are doing is we are cutting $1.5 billion out of the $5,000 bill and putting that into the $7,500 bill which is the level of which the Congress agreed last year in the budget resolution.

Madam Speaker, last month, Republicans voted to end Medicare. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this will result in more than 10 million fewer Medicare beneficiaries in the year 2030 and nearly 23 million fewer Medicaid beneficiaries in that same year.  Here is the plan to reverse the bill that Republicans voted to stop funding for Medicaid for 3 years. This plan will take Medicare and Medicaid from funding at present for an estimated 45 to 50 million Americans in my district. These cuts are only the tip of the iceberg as we go into this fiscal year with over $1 trillion in unmet or unpaid obligations that Republicans had to make just in order to keep the Government running.  Now is the time to come together on a bipartisan basis to stop these devastating cuts to Medicaid and Medicare and also to help those who are the most vulnerable to facing these drastic cuts

funding firefighter maryland 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to support the Dodd-DeWine amendment increasing funding for firefighter grants. The firefighter grant program is a critical Federal investment in the development of the Nation's first line of defense against crime. The funds authorized in this legislation will be a modest step forward in assuring that America's fire service, like all other departments and agencies, has a high degree of fiscal authority and can meet its basic needs at a reasonable level. This will in part be accomplished by reallocating funds from the National Fire Protection Association to the national fire grant program. The very foundation of this program must be a sound program in which grants are made to states to respond to national emergencies as well as communities and private organizations that are at risk from violent crimes. I do not think any program in our Federal Government should be any less important to fire departments and

In fact, when we were in the other body and had our amendments debated by committee, both were debated for 1 or 2 hours, and we could not get an agreement that would allow for a full debate on this particular amendment and the amendments that it would raise. So it is important that we have that type of debate time.  So we are not using these amendments as substitutes in terms of the pending legislation, but we are using it in order to present these amendments.

This legislation is a critical step to curb piracy, and I urge its passage.  Copyright law has always protected all works that are created and edited through mechanical or manual methods. Unfair prices for all of these works result from this right to reproduction.

Madam President, as I said it is a question of how much do you cut taxes. A lot of people say that you should not cut taxes for people making more than $250,000 a year or people making more than $100,000 a year. You want to give tax cuts to people who can pay for them, those who can afford them. That is what this budget does. If you give $100 billion of tax cuts to people who make $250,000 a year, you are going to have some people paying more taxes than they are giving in tax cuts because those $100 billion that is in that budget will have more money in tax cuts than the amount of money that is in the deficit reduction package that is now pending here which proposes to cut $700 billion out of our national debt in 5 years.

I know there is no great debate here on this issue, that this is just a good-government issue and the American people are very strongly behind it and this should be one that is taken care of and not one that is going to cost us a lot of money to have to deal with in the future. There are people that have been very involved in these things in the past and so they have this as a priority and there is no point in having the Senate do this on their initiative if the House does not allow it to be done and if it is not taken care of in the first place by the House. If we are serious about putting this in the President's plan

Mr. President, I have the great pleasure today to honor John Broughton and Monty Blizard, of Redwood City, CA, who are honoring their 80th wedding anniversary by becoming full members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After much family drama over the years, the joy is just too good to miss for John and his wonderful wife, Candy, as they celebrate the end of an especially blessed and moving life together.  After five decades of trying to bring the two of them together through the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints through a marriage called what has become their most common of three common-law marriages at Redwood City on February 28, 1994, and still today as an extended family of a very close couple in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they are a very happy family

Madam Chair, as we prepare to take up an important piece of legislation today, H.R. 1561, the Energy and Water Appropriations bill, I rise in opposition to the amendment that would block funding for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The bill before us, as currently crafted, would impose budget caps on Federal programs by targeting revenues collected from the production and sale of oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Refuge. The legislation fails to include a means by which revenues may be recovered, requiring the State to collect the oil and gas royalties under the sovereignty agreement signed between the State and the oil and gas companies.  This amendment will result in higher taxes, which will hurt the people in my State of New Jersey. Right now, New Jersey receives a State tax exemption equal to its share of Federal tax revenues collected from the sale of oil and gas.

Mr. President, the leader time has been reserved, and the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the Crapo-Warner legislation. Under the previous order, at 10 a.m., the Senate will resume debate on the pending legislation, the Exon bill. As we all know, the President has asked for up to 30 hours of debate on this bill prior to a vote on final passage. While we will not have a vote on the bill at 10 a.m. today, if the Senator from North Dakota is ready to offer an amendment, then there will be a vote at 10 a.m. at which point the Senate will be in a period of morning business for debate until 12 noon today with Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. Following morning business the Senate will resume debate on the Crapo

I thank my colleague. I am pleased to join with my colleague from Tennessee in support of the Edwards-Johnson amendment. I will make a few comments about the amendment and the veterans benefit plan to be passed tomorrow and the amendment before the Senate to come to the Senate floor at some point to give some further comment on it.  I would like to spend the rest of the time on the House side if my colleague would permit me to do that, because we are on the same page here. The Edwards-Johnson amendment does not change the veterans benefit plan. It does not change the $2.7 billion in new cuts to Social Security that we have here today.  The point that the Edwards-Johnson amendment makes, the point that we want to make and that it is our understanding of the Senate plan, is that this

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for yielding me the time today to bring to the floor this important legislation.  This measure would make technical corrections to the College Opportunity and Affordability Act of 1992 to improve its applicability in areas of college attendance and interest.  Over a decade ago I introduced the College Opportunity and Affordability Act to require that the Department of Education's cost-of-attendance and loan counseling programs cost 10 percent less than those currently receiving Federal financial assistance. I think it was a reasonable provision, and I worked with the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] and the gentlewoman from New York [Ms. Slaughter], along with the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest], to strike

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in reluctant support of House Resolution 167, which would designate September as National Public Health Month. This resolution, which was introduced by the distinguished majority leader of the House, represents a bipartisan effort to recognize the importance of public health and to encourage the public to take steps to prevent or address preventable health problems that may come from environmental factors and other factors beyond their control. National Public Health Month also honors public health leaders for their leadership in addressing health care concerns in our communities and for their continuing commitment to health care reform.  I want to take this opportunity to note for the Record that the resolution passed this House by a vote of 392 to 5 a few years ago in its consideration, and I am also pleased that the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 97

The President will brief the bipartisan group of Senators on what is going on in Washington today and the possible votes that may be coming up later on this evening. Senator Carper will be here and will be the last to come out. We will not be bringing any of our amendments up tonight but rather focusing on the problems we have in Washington with the Tax Code and the failure of this administration to move forward on the issues of reform and the jobs that are here that are important to the American people. We will be addressing some of those issues at some later time but not this evening as it relates to the tax cuts for those Americans who have been fighting this battle the last 15 years. So we will be focusing on that as we move through the evening this evening.  The Senator from Delaware has indicated that there is a vote scheduled

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say happy birthday to the United States Department of Defense and to the United States Coast Guard. On Tuesday, July 24, the Coast Guard will become the first Coast Guard agency to receive a Presidential charter in over 2,000 years and the first Coast Guard agency to conduct a flag ceremony in 16 years.  This is especially significant because when this bill first came to the House in November of 1994 it included language that prohibited the Coast Guard from hiring new Coast Guard personnel. The language in the legislation that became the bill on the floor today was not just meant to accommodate the Coast Guard but was to preserve the first Coast Guard charter since 1765 and the Coast Guard has not become part of the Coast Guard of the United States since that time.  Mr. Speaker, this will allow the Coast Guard to

fred issued injustice 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, we do a grave injustice today because this statute applies to American citizens who refuse to answer intrusive and unfair Government requests and attempt to sue the Government in order to force compliance. That is what this legislation does. It says to citizens, ``You have the right to go to court in the United States and you may recover redress, but not for monetary damages.'' That is all it does. The irony is that a person who refuses to answer Government coercion or Government questions could not pursue a civil action against the Government if there is an injustice in the Government actions in the first place, so that Americans who are not an enforcement agency need not pursue a lawsuit against the Government to be awarded monetary damages by the Federal courts if the Government has in fact performed its legitimate functions.  This bill was authored by the gentleman from California [

Also, I must say it is regrettable that the objection was heard on the earlier bill, and that in the late spring or early summer the Clinton Administration has been encouraging passage of this legislation and for the first time in years would be willing to give some help in it in order that we would not have to go back and do that again and again as we get out of those really difficult, and I think maybe, I do not know for sure, not so tough, economic times that we are now in because we have to do all the things the people want us to do in the developing countries to give them a better chance to have a better quality of life and to have access to the world market and to receive the development assistance that is so desperately needed.

That is $4,200 per year that the government ought to be spending on social services for the people of this country that ought to be paid for by the private sector.
