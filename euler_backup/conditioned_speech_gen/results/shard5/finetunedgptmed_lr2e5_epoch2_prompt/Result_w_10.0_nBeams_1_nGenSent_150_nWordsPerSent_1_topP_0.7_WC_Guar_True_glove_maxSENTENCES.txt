Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have spoken in opposition to the budget resolution that the Government is now considering that has been given to us by the President of the United States in the Budget of the United States of America on statistics and figures that I think are just wrong.  I would say to my colleagues, first of all, that this budget resolution will do nothing to solve the problems that we have.  Second, it will not balance the budget. It will not balance the budget, because it is going to spend more money than we are taking in.  Third, it will not save the taxpayers any money. I think this budget resolution will do very little to save the taxpayers any money.  And fourth, it will not balance the budget in 10 years.  Now,

It would provide the first real accountability for the ways in which our government has engaged in abusive tax avoidance and is subject to unjust taxation.  It would extend the provisions of the Tax Code for 5 years, extending the alternative minimum tax for a further 2 years.  And it would apply to all corporations, except for those controlled by foreign governments or those that are exempt from the foreign sales tax, as well as partnerships and sole proprietorships.

The situation in Iraq and the region is truly desperate. There is no excuse for any war in Iraq.  Unfortunately, it is also important to note that Saddam Hussein has become an international pariah.

Mr. President, we will return to the consideration of H.R. 2 this morning. Last night, amendments dealing with the so-called security of our homeland were offered by Senators Kennedy and Lieberman. The amendment offered by Senator Lieberman would create a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service [USCIS] czar to oversee the adjudication of illegal immigrants, a process that, according to some, is now too costly, too burdensome, and that will have a negative impact on American businesses. I believe that this amendment is a misguided attempt to expand the power of the executive branch.  I am concerned about the way this legislation is being written. The bill would not have been possible without the cooperation of Senators Kennedy and Lieberman, the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. They have been helpful in the process.

But when you talk about fighting hunger, don't cut food stamps $40 billion. Don't suggest that we tax people for stamps that we don't need to fund the programs that people in this country need and want and are seeking and Chairman Rangel and I have been fighting for for years.  I will tell you this: I spent $70 million in the State of New Jersey on a whole host of programs that we needed to fund for the people of my district.

Mr. President, there have been a number of occasions on which this body has debated the issue of trade and the practice of trade in the United States and the United States-Mexico State. In Pennsylvania we were just recently debating the issue of the United States-Canada free trade agreement. I do not believe that we can continue on a course of that sort without first beginning to look at the fact that there is a tendency for this country to play with the idea of free trade as a trade policy. The problem is, we are playing with it in the wrong way. The problem is that it is being done with a level of arrogance that is not appropriate in any civilized society. It is the arrogance of a nation that can think that the best way to achieve a common goal--a common goal that is for the benefit of all of

I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Congresswoman Capito to ensure that working families have the protections they need to protect themselves and their families from the provisions in the amendments offered by the gentleman from Georgia.  The welfare system that we have in place is not a perfect system. We are all, of course, entitled to our own opinions about what is best for us, but I think the fact that we are here today talking about this is indicative of the problems that exist in the system.  The GAO, for example, found that this provision, the reduction of the child credit for parents with children of more than $5,000, is intended to encourage recipients to remain in the work force and thus increase welfare caseloads and reduce the benefits that are provided

Mr. President, one of the many interesting challenges this Congress will face is that of the financial markets that move on finance committees.  Mr. President, I rise to address some of the concerns raised about the impending bankruptcy of the U.S. banking system.  I believe this is a very serious problem that has been unfolding for several years now.  I think the American people have a very strong interest in this matter.  The crisis that has occurred over the past few years has created a financial situation in which we have had to cope with two very important aspects.  First, the collapse of the banks in America.  Second, the financial system which is being held hostage by the banks.  It is my belief that the Federal Government's first and most important role is to ensure that the American people and businesses are protected

This bill requires that all ``party-to-commerce'' transactions are routed through the Federal Register.

In some ways I think we are here because of the desire to achieve what we want to achieve. I think it is a desire to have equal opportunity. I think we have to recognize that there are some disparities in the way in which these funds are spent.  I think it is fair to say that the system in some areas, especially in the rural areas, has been dramatically improved over the last several years.  But

Mr. Speaker, the Governor of my home State of California has called for the Federal Government to close its Federal Home Loan Bank in my State because it has been unable to get enough funding to better run it even though it is worse off today than it was 5 years ago.  This is outrageous. The Republican Governor of California wants the Federal Government to open its doors and allow local communities to better manage their own affairs. The problem is that, unfortunately, the Democrats in the House and Senate have blocked the Republican Governor from implementing his own vision for a better community.  The reality is that our communities have grown and, as a result, we have become more competitive in the global economy. We have also established more good jobs, and we have saved taxpayers millions of dollars. The real problem is that the Democrats have refused to give local

I appreciate the ranking member's cooperation in that. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Chairman Goodling's bill to reauthorize the Small Business Administration for fiscal year 1998 and beyond. In addition to its important programs for small businesses and the Nation as a whole that occur in the SBA and in the economic development programs that are part of the SBA and its regional offices and in China and India, the Small Business Administration's programs are also of great importance to American businesses, particularly to my State of Wisconsin.  For over a century, the SBA has provided vital support to businesses in Wisconsin. Today, nearly half of the SBA's total budget is directed toward small business programs, and this is more than double the amount spent on all of its domestic programs. Small businesses in Wisconsin, along with all other small businesses in

I know that you have spent much time on energy policy issues. It is a question of how you balance that with future security and the oil and gas industry and its growing number of production facilities in this country, which is important. We have a lot of challenges. But it is not an area that we have to wait for a global emergency to address.  So I would like to just briefly say this is not a way to have a comprehensive energy policy. It is a way to have a piecemeal approach, and the way to do that is to look at what works, what doesn't, and then, when it works, make sure we have the flexibility to adapt it.  We have seen what happens in our area when we do that. I think it is important that we do not give up our energy security,

Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R 347 which grants the Purple Heart medals to Speaker Tip O'Neill and former President Richard Nixon.  My support of this legislation is based on the fact that the Purple Heart medals have served as an excellent way to honor those who have lost their lives in the line of duty.  I first became interested in this issue when I was appointed by President Reagan to the Veterans' Affairs Committee in 1981. During that time, I served on the Subcommittee on Personnel of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which had jurisdiction over the issue of the Purple Heart medals.  I have since worked closely with the former President and his widow, Nancy Reagan, as well as with members of the Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation.

Mr. President, the torture debate took another deeply troubling turn yesterday. The Nation learned the President has asked Congress to give him the power to investigate whether any aspect of the troubling case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was captured by the U.S. in May 2001, was covered up.  President Bush, in a memo to Attorney General Gonzales, asked that Congress approve his request to authorize the CIA to release hundreds of pages of documents, many of which are in the possession of the Justice Department, including phone records, computer records, documents from his private home, and other information. This action would make clear that the President intends to investigate, prosecute, and punish those who have perpetrated this horrible crime.  I am proud to have worked with Senator McCain and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee to pass legislation last year to give

Mr. Chairman, I think it is fascinating the way this amendment reads. None of the State law enforcement funds can be used to do a large part of the amendment because they are not large enough to be a large part of the small, low-risk crime that is currently covered under the law.  Now, I am not sure how you make a case that a State can't afford to do the training and have the resources to be able to protect itself, but I am not saying that. The fact of the matter is the law does cover small, low-risk crimes. The problem with this amendment is that we have a whole bunch of money for the State Department, for a bunch of things, that are not big enough to cover this large number of crime victims, and this amendment is simply a terrible way to try to deal

Mr. Speaker, it is essential that we honor those commitments. And I was stricken by something that just happened this morning that we find that we honor those commitments today by passing this legislation that has been so critical to the administration's effort to finally give us an opportunity to have a new mission, to begin to change the course of Iraq and to change the course of the Middle East.  I was just listening to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I was just amazed by what he said about the administration's approach. We have the Bush administration now telling us that the only way that we can change the course of Iraq is to put the Iraqi people in the position of asking for help.  And what do we know? That is what the Iraq Study Group says. That is what the American Legion says. That is what the former heads

Mr. Speaker, a government spokesman has said people from poor countries are taking jobs and government benefits and now we have a country that is poor and now we have people coming to the United States and taking government benefits and then taking those jobs and the government benefits. We are sending them back to a poor country. I think that is wrong.  The other point I would make is this. There is a suggestion that this is a matter of national security. The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] has said it is not. He has said it is not a matter of national security. We are doing this because we have a national security interest.  If the gentleman wants to do something to protect us from terrorists, that is a good thing. But we do not want people coming into our country from poor countries, taking the

I appreciate the cooperative effort as evidenced by the Senator from Washington. It has been a real pleasure to work with Senator Murray and Senator Inhofe on this bill and also the State of the Union address this past Monday. I particularly appreciated the fact that this is evidenced by a bipartisan effort that has worked out a number of issues, including the issue of full and fair consideration for any striker replacement. It is a matter of fundamental fairness.  The Federal Government has long been willing to negotiate a substitute, a reasonable substitute, when it comes to labor negotiations, and has even taken an active role in this process. I think that it is a laudable goal that we can come to a fair agreement on labor negotiations in a fair way.  I want to highlight some of the good work that has been done by Senator Inhofe

Mr. President, just moments ago I left a reception for a friend, David Brody. I wanted to take a moment to pay tribute to him and his retirement after 25 years of dedicated service to the Senate and to the Congress of the United States. He will be celebrating his birthday in March of this year. The Senate resolution to rename the U.S. courthouse in Washington, DC, in his honor was passed unanimously by the Senate in March of this year.  David Brody was born in Washington, DC, in June of 1946. He attended the University of Virginia and the University of Michigan. After graduating from the University of Michigan, he clerked for the Honorable Gerald Ford in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In 1969, David was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives,

Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record my op-ed article entitled ``Overhaul Without Oversight'' from The Washington Post on the Department of Education legislation that Speaker Gingrich and the Republican leadership have brought before us today.  I am not one who always agrees with the party in power, but the fact is, this Congress has no choice. It has a responsibility to conduct oversight of the Department of Education.  If the majority's legislation were enacted into law, it would force the Department to determine the effectiveness of its current financial aid and loan programs.  Mr. Speaker, this is a proposal that the American people, and this Congress, should be able to vote on. If they don't, we have no choice but to hold hearings. We have no choice but to do a lot of soul searching.  This legislation is a cynical attempt to score

Yesterday, the Trump administration made a surprise announcement that it would not take part in the newly agreed upon healthcare bill, the American Health Care Act.  If you believe that it's too bad the House of Representatives will not pass this bill, then you should vote ``no.''  For months, Republicans and Democrats have tried to craft a plan that will create competition in the healthcare market and preserve the Affordable Care Act.  But the Trump administration has told us that the House will not have the votes to get it done, so they have decided to sabotage the health care bill.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the bill. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the bill. I would like to start by saying that I support veterans and their bases. But I also want to point out that this bill makes important changes in VA health care.  I support veterans' health care. I have been a supporter of VA health care reform. But, Mr. Chairman, the bill that we are debating today is flawed and it is a bad bill.  Mr. Chairman, I think this bill will not pass the House. It will not pass the Senate. But, if we vote against it, the American people will see this bill as a bad bill, because it will not get through the Senate. I believe that veterans' health care should be a priority for the Congress and for the administration.

Mr. President, I wish to make a third point, which is that, quite frankly, I am disappointed that Senate Democrats have chosen to hold emergency legislation hostage to vote on the constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act violated the Constitution. The amendment was not needed to achieve this. It was unnecessary.  This was not an issue of making marriage a fundamental right. It was a question of whether the Congress was going to be able to pass a law to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. We have never passed a law to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and we should not pass a law to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman.

Mr. President, earlier this year, I joined Senator Kyl and others in introducing legislation which would tax the use of one-time work expenses that are used to pay for State and local income tax withholding. Senator Kyl and I believe this proposal will raise revenues for State and local governments and help reduce the tax burden that is imposed on millions of American taxpayers.  State and local governments rely on income tax withholding for more than 60 percent of their income, so we need to make sure that withholding is not used to pay for any other Federal taxes. But we cannot make this tax exemption permanent. For that reason, we must allow States and local governments to extend their withholding to pay income tax withholding for the balance of the year.  This is the wrong time to provide a permanent exemption from Federal income tax withholding for State and local governments. This

This legislation will improve border security by establishing units of the INS, CBP, Customs, and Border Protection to better coordinate and coordinate operations across the border. This legislation will strengthen our immigration enforcement system by improving the processing and deporting of undocumented immigrants.

He then served as a district attorney in his hometown of Tulsa, where he fought for public safety and for the rights of his fellow citizens.  Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank my good friend and colleague from the great State of Texas, Bill Archer, for his tireless work in this cause. We have all known Congressman Archer as a person who never shied away from fighting for what he believed in. He is a man of conviction, a champion for the people, and a champion for our country.  This resolution will not only pay

I know that in our Contract With America we talked about the importance of the worker and about the American worker and the importance of taking a step back and looking at what the minimum wage is, what it is costing us, what it is costing the American taxpayer, what it is costing American families.

The fact is that this legislation was first introduced on the Senate floor by Senator Grassley and Senator Hollings, both of whom are former employees of the SBA. I would just like to make the point that the SBA does not like to see risky legislation pass its desk, so they do not want to be the first to pass a risk-based bill, but that is what this bill is.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

But as the American people go to the polls today to cast their votes, they are going to be confronted with an equally daunting task, and that is making sure they have all of the information necessary to vote.  That is why it is imperative that we provide the American people with all the information they need to know in order to make an informed decision on the tax implications of the proposed $500 per child tax credit. This is not a controversial issue. For many years, many Americans have supported the tax credit.

Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate, on behalf of myself and Senator President Clinton a resolution to support the goals and ideals of the year 2000 Good Friday Agreement. This resolution recognizes the enormous contributions of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Northern Ireland to the United States and recognizes their continuing contributions to our national interests and security. I am particularly pleased to see the adoption of this resolution by the House of Representatives today.  In November, the Senate overwhelmingly approved a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that ``the House of Representatives should recognize and fully support the goals and ideals of the Good Friday Agreement.'' The House of Representatives, as the majority, was right to support this resolution and recognize the significance of the Good Friday Agreement and its recognition of the essential contribution of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Northern Ireland to the United

Mr. President, during the past year I have repeatedly been approached by citizens of my State who repeatedly ask why Congress is not passing legislation to provide basic health insurance to all Americans.  At a time when America is struggling to provide basic health insurance to its citizens, I have often wondered why Congress is not passing legislation to provide basic health insurance to all Americans.  In fact, I am told by many Americans that this question is not a personal one for them. It is not a question of being concerned about their ability to obtain health insurance, as their families and friends are required to pay their own health insurance premiums.  The question is, Why is Congress not doing the right thing?  Why is Congress not doing the right thing for the American people?  Because, according to the Census Bureau, there are now over 37 million

Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment with where we find ourselves on the President's budget proposal to balance the budget in 7 years using deficit reduction dollars that have already been invested in the infrastructure of Louisiana, New York, and other States and dollars that will be invested in our Nation to help us build infrastructure projects to help us pay for billion dollar tax cuts that we have been offering for years.  The President's budget is a historic failure, a grave mistake for our Nation. I think that is the only way to describe it. The President's budget is a complete and total failure in the area of infrastructure investment. It fails to address our Nation's growing and increasingly serious infrastructure problems, such as our inability to maintain a solid and reliable transportation infrastructure.

This bill does not include enough money to ensure that our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan have the training and equipment they need to win the war on terror. This bill does not include enough money to strengthen our borders to keep our Nation safe.  There is a reason why we have a Republican majority in this House.

Mr. President, as I was saying, we do have a lot of people who want to vote for the bill in the States, and I think that is important. The people who do not want to vote for it are being totally misinformed.  I have a suggestion, and I am happy to yield to my friend. We have talked about this for some time. It is a very simple proposal. It says that if a State has a cap on it, then the Federal Government, as it passes this, must do something to get rid of the cap.  This is a big State. If we are going to pass a bill that is going to help that State, then we ought to do something to get rid of the cap, and that is what this amendment is all about.  We are going to be discussing it

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding.

These two bills are a one-two punch that multiple-shot the American economy. They have been devastating to small businesses, to State and local governments, and to the American economy.  The Family and Medical Leave Act was not designed to be the mother of all family leave provisions. This legislation is simply an extension of the existing law, and this is a real loss to American workers and American businesses.  In order to get the President's $500 per child tax credit for working parents, the conference report eliminates the existing $250 per child tax credit for working parents.

Mr. Chairman, I strongly support Mr. DeFazio's amendment to provide an additional 26 weeks of benefits to workers providing services in bankruptcy. I am also pleased to support his amendment to provide an additional 5 months of benefits to workers who have filed for bankruptcy.  In 1997, the bankruptcy laws in the United States established a three-tier system for determining bankruptcy. The first tier is the rule of law; the second is creditors; and the third is the workers. This system has resulted in the best, most equitable system of bankruptcy relief in the world. However, there are those who wish to deny relief to workers. In my opinion, denying relief to workers in bankruptcy is the wrong thing to do. The first tier of bankruptcy provides protection to those workers who need it the most, and the second tier of bankruptcy provides protection to those workers who

I am concerned that the American companies that currently dominate the information technology market have little incentive to pursue these new technologies, and that the products they produce may not be competitive with foreign competitors.

In fact, there are only three exceptions to the requirement of the President to provide the Congress with an up-to-date description of his nominees.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the late crew of the space shuttle Columbia and the Texas A&M University Houston Center. On Saturday, June 2, 2005, on the 22nd of June, astronauts Michael Anderson, Mike Hopkins, David Brown, Laurel Clark, John Young, Michael Anderson, and Commander Rick Husband completed the historic mission to the International Space Station.  It was not an easy mission for the crew. In the first few hours, it was nearly impossible to see the sky, and the loss of communications with the space station mission control was a major inconvenience.  But the astronauts have proved their mettle and spirit, and it is a testament to their leadership and dedication that they will continue to carry on in space. Their efforts have truly brought this Nation and mankind closer together and made the world

I was disappointed to hear that in her maiden speech, the Speaker claimed to have cut the deficit by $5 trillion.  But, Mr. Speaker, I am here to say that we must not just say we have cut the deficit by $5 trillion. We have cut it by hundreds of billions of dollars. And when we talk about cuts, it is important to remember that the people that the Republicans are targeting have a larger share of the cuts than the people that we are targeting.

Speaker Gingrich's version of the bill fails to include any specific language regarding domestic violence, which is not only unacceptable but detrimental to our law enforcement officers and victims.  Instead, this legislation focuses on sex crimes, a clear violation of our Constitution and the American public's right to know. H.R. 4970 authorizes the President to establish the Justice for Victims of Sex Crimes Act. This bill, like all the others before it, will ignore the overwhelming evidence of the need to punish those who sexually assault or assault a woman. It will also ignore the rights of victims to have their stories heard and to have their cases handled in a fair and impartial manner.  As the American public has seen time and time again,

Mr. President. 6 years ago this month, more than 100,000 Bahrainis of all ages and all walks of life gathered in the state capital of Manama to submit recommendations to the Bahraini people for democracy, human rights, and economic development.  The Congress has a responsibility to help to achieve the objectives of the Bahraini people by supporting them in their quest for democratic reform and a just and peaceful society.  The Bahraini people have made great strides in pursuing this goal. In 2003, Bahrain's political opposition was banned and a military-backed parliament was installed. Since then, Bahrain has enjoyed a prosperous economic and social history. The people of Bahrain are eager to pursue the economic, social, and cultural progress that they have achieved over the past few years.

Mr. President, I have for many years now supported a line-item veto that can help clear wasteful spending and allow Congress to have the support it needs to govern. I have also voted for some of the most costly items in the Federal Government, including a whole host of unnecessary and expensive entitlements.  I am now beginning to reconsider. I think the line-item veto is an important tool for Congress to use in times of emergency, when the spending in a program has outpaced the resources available to it. I have now come to the realization that, in some cases, there is no emergency and, in other cases, we are not spending enough money.  I believe, as I have indicated in the past, that if Congress can get its fiscal house in order, we can find a way to bring the budget into balance without

Mr. Speaker, more than half of the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans today for the wealthy were passed during the Clinton administration when Speaker Gingrich was the majority leader of the House and President Clinton was the majority Senate majority leader in the House and Senate respectively during the Clinton years in the debate about tax increases on the American people and more than half of those tax increases were for the percent of income above $250,000 a year.  The first question that is asked by people who oppose tax cuts for the wealthy is: What is wrong with a $500 tax credit? Well, the Republican majority leadership is proposing a $500 tax credit for the wealthiest Americans. They are asking the wealthiest Americans to pay an additional $500 tax credit. It is a big tax cut for the wealthiest Americans.  Now, if you want to have a

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides a tax credit to service-disabled veterans for participation in the amendment process of the Veterans Tax Assistance Program and the committee bill as well as the Speaker's proposal.  This bill also provides a refundable credit of $1,000 to disabled veterans who have a physical impairment resulting from service-connected injuries. The credit is used to reduce the amount of medical care that a veteran is required to pay out of his or her own pocket. The bill also extends the program to members of the National Guard and the Reserves.  This program is the same one which was enacted into law in 1986 and which was used by the Disabled American Veterans and others who have been participating in the program for a number of years.

As we look at the so-called violent crime bill, I think we should remember that it's not a bill about making criminals out of thugs.

Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society. Likewise, I would like to make sure that we continue to gather and defend data to better understand the problem of hate crimes and to bring perpetrators to justice.  A 2003 report by the Justice Department found that, nationwide, approximately 1,600 crimes were motivated by bias based on race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or national origin. These crimes can have a devastating effect on a victim's sense of self worth and confidence.  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Democrats are committed to health care reform that works for all Americans. We will protect Medicare and save the taxpayers money.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, before the Senator from California leaves the floor, might I just say, from what I heard the majority leader say the other day that this is part of the strategy of the Republicans to control the Senate and to make it more difficult for us to do what we do, and we will not have a filibuster. That is true. It is also true that the Republican leader has said that there is no intention of changing the rules to change the rules. I will tell the Senator from California that we are not going to change the rules to change the rules.  We are going to try to keep the rules the same, and we are going to try to pass the most important piece of legislation we can, which is the budget resolution.

Employees could decide to forego a salary increase and accept lower pay in order to continue working for their employers and workers who provide them with their information and support.

For employers, they can deduct that expense for each employee. For workers, they can deduct it for each worker.

I want to take this opportunity to thank the chairmen of the Appropriations Committee and the Ways and Means Committee for their help in getting this bill to the floor so we can consume it in a timely manner.  This bill provides a 1-year extension of the 2010 farm bill.  This bill provides $250 million in funding to help farmers meet the unprecedented costs of drought and extreme weather.  This bill contains $6.5 billion in emergency disaster relief.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation which will allow the Federal Government to conduct Web site security testing for the Office of Personnel Management and the Department of Defense on illegal immigrants.  In an age of readily available online information, it is more important than ever that Americans consume accurate, up-to-date information about themselves. I am concerned that the unauthorized use of Federal Web sites by illegal aliens is taking place in the name of security. Unfortunately, this concern is not confined to the illegal immigrant population.  In fact, the illegal alien population of the United States is a sizable one, comprising between 40 and 50 percent of the total U.S. population. According to the Department of Homeland Security, this is a high percentage because the illegal alien population is

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. And just to be clear about this bill and the debate that is taking place here in the world today, as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) has indicated, this is not about one of the three main components of our national security: nuclear weapons, conventional weapons, or non-nuclear weapons. This is about our national security.  Mr. Speaker, we have a massive problem with nuclear weapons. We are losing 1,700 warheads, over 600,000 in Europe alone, by the year 2020. In other words, this is a fact.  We are not, Mr. Speaker, trying to encourage people to go off the nuclear bomb. What we are trying to do is to encourage people to have some alternatives to nuclear weapons. The reason why we are

I think it is good to clear the issue because I think you and I both know that we all have good intentions in this and it is not in the United States' interest to send the wrong message to the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am concerned that if we go into a war that has not been declared and the majority of the troops are not there, that we will be giving away this important country that has so much to offer the world. And the issue of the responsibility of the United States is one of which I am very concerned.

John and Monty began their public service career as partners in the Gallatin Chamber of Commerce, a firm that helped create jobs in the area and which was also named the Gallatin Chamber of Commerce by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. John and Monty's accomplishments are truly remarkable.  John Broughton served as president and chief executive officer of Gallatin Chamber of Commerce for 27 years. He was instrumental in creating the first regional economic development organization in the State of Kentucky and serving as the chamber's founding president.

Madam Chair, as we prepare to take up an important piece of legislation today, H.R. 3 amended legislation which I have been working on for over 5 years and which I have introduced and introduced energy production tax credits for small businesses. I believe it is time to move this legislation forward, and that is why I am introducing today the ``Clean Economy Small Business Tax Credits for Energy Production Act of 2012.''  The energy production tax credits will help small businesses, particularly small businesses with over 50 employees, to create and invest in new technologies, reduce energy costs, and create new jobs in America. I have heard from the owners and operators of small businesses across my district and throughout the Nation who support this bill.  These credits are intended to create jobs in America. The credit is paid to the company by the government, and the tax credits for
