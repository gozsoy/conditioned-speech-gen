Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have spoken so well today on this important issue of trust and respect for the government of the United States. I believe that this debate is not the time to belittle the other side of this debate. That debate will not come up next week or the week after next week on the Budget Committee, and it will not come up on the floor of the Senate on the statistics in this matter. That is not the time for that debate.  I am just as concerned about trust and respect for the American people as they are about trust and respect for this great government that we serve, that we will follow. I will tell the Members of this Senate that I have sought to put every procedural line on the record in support of this amendment which seeks to correct

I would remind the American people that this issue is a bipartisan issue. The Democrats from both parties have cosponsored this legislation.

That legislation was passed by the Commerce Committee, and by the same committee, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake), introduced the Aviation Lands Improvement Act. I, myself, held numerous hearings on the Aviation Lands Improvement Act.  There are substantial parts of the bill that are quite similar to other FAA issues. The bill establishes a 13-member Aviation Advisory Committee to ensure that Federal Aviation Administration policy does not interfere with local aviation and other FAA policies.

And it is going to be horse-trading with the Greeks, because we have to, even though we would be able to give them a little lift on some of the burdens that they would have to bear, all we would do is create the appearance that our colleagues in the Congress were not aware of Greece as a potential problem and then we would borrow the money.

Republicans want to change this legislation so we can take a responsible approach that will give all the incentives in the world to find genuine American-born jobs, secure our borders, and produce a stable Nation.  While we were in this body, we introduced an immigration reform proposal that gave 5 million legitimate legal permanent residents an opportunity to work and sponsor their families for a full 2 years before they could become citizens.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Health Care Act of 2020 that seeks to restore the funding of the health care system for our Nation's veterans by reducing the amount that the Department of Veterans Affairs should report as administrative expenses.  The underlying bill reduces VA's overall budget by more than $1 billion for fiscal year 2020 by eliminating childcare for two-thirds of the 2.1 million veterans living in senior military facilities due to budget delays. The VA proposed cuts in childcare under this bill, but the House has not acted on that cut.  As my colleagues know, the VA is already facing funding cuts in the wake of 9/11. While VA is already facing deep budgetary shortfalls, I know that we can and should work together to protect and support our veterans while creating a

Mr. President, one of the many interesting challenges this Congress will face is that of trying to make sure we move on spending cuts. Congress passed a budget the Finance Committee, the other body, worked out. It is a 7-year budget, so it is fairly well-settled.  But the Finance Committee acted today and said we do not have the money, and the House Republicans joined us in saying we do not have the money. I think there is broad agreement that we have an entitlement, an entitlement program for Medicare that Congress has decided it wants to pay for--that is, because we have not asked the American taxpayers for the money.  We can cut it out, but in the end we have got to tell the American taxpayers, no, you do not pay for what we are doing.  Senator Fr

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5126, the ``Truth in Caller ID Act.'' The Truth in Caller ID Act would encourage Americans to learn more about consumers' banking and financial accounts by requiring consumer reporting agencies to report financial and billing information to credit bureaus that provide financial services to consumers and provide communication between consumer and financial institutions of commerce.  The ``Truth in Caller ID Act'' requires the financial service organizations providing financial services to consumers to disclose accurate and complete information about all information provided on a consumer's credit or debit card to consumers. The bill provides for $10 million for the Commodity Credit Corporation's Predatory Transaction Reporting initiative and $2 million for the FTC's Nationwide Problem Reporting Initiative, as authorized by law.  Information collection of consumers' financial and consumer credit accounts is important to prevent fraud and identity theft,

We can debate how many people the Federal Government can fire for a small infraction, but to try to pay the Federal employees for that infraction is unfair.

Mr. President, America has come a long way in addressing discrimination in the workplace since the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown versus Board of Education in 1954. Today, the Senate is poised to vote to restore the right of an all-male majority in the United States Senate to address sex-based discrimination in the workplace. I have been fighting for this right for decades in this country and since that time the rule of law has not worked for a majority of women and girls in this country, many of whom are at great risk of being left behind because of the Irish system of education. The Irish system of education provided high education to women and girls who lived and worked in Ireland. Education was guaranteed to everyone, regardless of where one lived, how one lived, or where one labored. Men did not have to learn about women's

Mr. Speaker, gas prices are at a record high, at over $3 per gallon. Yet the foreign oil companies and the oil companies that support them continue to pump billions of barrels of high-cost gas into this country from the B.C. fields.  The primary mission of the oil companies is to extract as much oil and natural gas as they can from the earth. For decades they have done this with the aid of the tax breaks for oil and gas companies and the sweetheart deals for oil and gas companies. The deal in the pipeline today with the Members of the U.S. Senate is a good deal. It means that we are going to create 40,000 new high-paying jobs.

Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his work and support on this legislation.  The House Oversight Committee found that the administration did not provide adequate information in approving requests for additional funds for the Office of Inspector General, which oversees the programs and operations of Federal workers union affiliates. They also found that the Attorney General used the Office of Inspector General to expand his office's office in Arkansas in violation of rules of procedure.  The House Oversight Committee found a conflict between the President's claims that there was no wrongdoing and his own failures in not approving many more of these requests.  This bill will update the provision in the Hatch-Waxman Act that requires the Attorney General to establish a list of affiliated Federal union affiliates by the end of the year, which I strongly support.

Now, they have some freshmen Senators who are about to, as I indicated, hold hearings on this issue.

To those I visited, I could tell they were looking to save their health care for their children and grandchildren and not looking for an easy solution but one that would give them some certainty to medical decisions that would not break their budget for next year.  According to the Washington Post, most of the people's health care, excluding their premiums, is subject to the whims of congressional Republicans, and they are holding up this legislation because of a bill that will increase costs for both seniors and employers, especially small businesses. This act jeopardizes the ability of families to buy the kinds of coverage they like and employers to hire the type of workers they need.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome Gil Kerlikowske, recently confirmed as Commissioner of the United States Postal Service as we consider the post office privatization plan in this Nation's Capital. Gil was recently named by the President as the ``For the American People Part of this Nation Today Time for Time for America Needs for We the People Report on Bill Clinton and the critical problems facing this Nation and our Nation's families.  Gil's tenure at the Postal Service was characterized by a caring, involved, and conscientious leadership style. He has served for 5 years as Chairman, President and CEO of Citizens Mail and American Express. He spent more than 30 years in the private sector and was an invaluable resource to both businesses and Government leaders in Rhode Island and the Nation. Throughout his tenure at Citizens Mail, Gil was a fixture in his own community, serving as Mayor

So I think, based on what the gentleman has stated and where we are at this point in the negotiations with the other body and the administration on this wetlands amendment, we think that if we can get a date certain in which we can make sure that the gentleman will see that that is handled on a timely basis, I think we would be more than happy to yield back the remainder of the time, take a vote on the Rangel amendment, and move on to other business

Mr. Speaker, today marks the 174th anniversary of the declaration of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greek independence marks the birth of the modern state of Greece and of the nation of Greece itself. Greek independence is a vital part of the history and culture of this country. I rise today to pay tribute to the lasting impact that Greek independence has had on the United States.  My home State of Oregon has been a member of the United States and my home country since it was incorporated by the King of Greece, David I. King on January 1, 1821. Oregon's citizens proudly fought in the American Civil War, leading the Union into victory over a stubborn, poorly organized British army. The cultural bond between Oregon and the United States goes back far beyond 1821 and, in fact, began with the fact that the high sea nation

The bill I introduced Senator Kyl and others introduced was about the rising number of uninsured in this country. A decade ago, the number of uninsured in this country was 21 million. Today, it is over 45 million, and now the Senate is about to vote on a budget that will end the 23 years of neglect which has kept this country on a diet of paying our way with the business of the Federal Government.

This bill I think sets an important precedent by providing an opportunity to provide a basis for Congress and the administration to address the massive influence of the two railway cartels that are in

Mr. President, today I honor Lewis Monroe Huddleston on the upcoming occasion of his 80th birthday. Lewis passed away on August 28 at the age of 84 after a long and successful life. His family has shown their profound and wonderful love and support for Lewis by naming the Morris County courthouse in Morrisville, GA, after Lewis, Lew.  Born in Blountville, GA, on November 7, 1919, Lewis graduated from Morrisville High School in 1942. Lewis worked as a Sidney W. Pike printer before accepting his first teaching job at the Morrisville Branch of the University of Georgia in 1946. Lewis held a number of teaching posts for the university, including the post of assistant vice chancellor for instruction from 1951 to 1952, the post of interim vice president for intercollegiate instruction from 1952 to 1954, and the post of president

Because it has been built on the principles of partnership and as a result has been both successful and Australia and Israel a friend to America and a friend to Israel.

Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, in these hallowed Halls, we have the power to do the right thing, to act on the good of the Nation and to act to protect the health of American families and businesses.  Most Americans know that Medicare and Medicaid provide essential health care to millions of seniors and disabled patients in hospitals and home health care programs nationwide.  But in the wealthiest nation in the history of the world, the Federal Government does not have the funds or the will to foster the inclusion of health care in the costs of goods and services which many consumers pay. Instead, the Federal Government mandates costly government-mandated policies. Yet under this Medicare and Medicaid system, under this Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, American families in need are paying the price for the arrogance of the government in Washington and the arrogance of bureaucrats who want to

Following morning business the Senate will resume consideration of the health care bill and we hope to complete action on the health care bill this week and complete that action by the time we leave for the Memorial Day break on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week if possible. So we will be on information on that issue for the foreseeable future. The majority leader, hopefully, will be here by the end of today, Thursday, for us to be able to finish this bill.

Mr. President, we want to give seniors the right to choose in as many areas as possible. We will continue to work with seniors on the subject of access to care. The legislation we introduced earlier this year, the so-called Do Not Government Bill, continues to be a key part of the Medicare bill and is a very significant way for the Senate to improve Medicare, and I want to extend it and thank Senator Enzi for bringing it to the floor today.  As we said at the beginning of the debate on this bill, the majority of all Medicare recipients pay the full cost of prescription drugs, with more than half of Medicare beneficiaries paying no less than $250 a month. So it is vital that this bill address concerns seniors have about their ability to keep their Medicare plan when they change plans and to take advantage of plans

Mr. President, this amendment is a commonsense reform that allows the Joint Committee on Taxation to prepare tax bill information based on the legislation passed by Congress.

I think it is a very simple amendment because it simply states that if any Senator wants to have any amendments after that moment of silence, they can get that amendment.  I do not think there is any effort by this committee to give up any part of the process of the Senate. I think the Senators here have a unique responsibility to vote on and debate amendments that are germane. They have said there is no point in getting a recorded vote, and that is entirely fine. They are going to have to ask for a recorded vote, they have agreed that when they debate an amendment, they have a right to have a vote after that moment of silence.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight to debate this most important provision of the defense bill that will be considered by the Senate on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week by unanimous consent and the conference committee will make important and needed corrections and changes to the State Department program.  We have before us an amendment which I think will strike an important element of the agreement between the administration and the Senate, and I hope that our colleagues will join me in supporting it. This amendment focuses on a portion of a provision in the bill that requires that States provide DOD with a 90-day opportunity to review the performance of their local and State human rights commissions and human rights monitors prior to selecting one to begin next year. We have already been briefed on the Human Rights Commission, and all Members can tell us how much we value their continuing work to protect

Mr. Speaker, I am for the supplemental, for a strong defense, and a supporter of the budget that helps our military recover from the extraordinary losses that we have seen in the last 12 months. That is not going to be part of the President's plan if we increase our debt by $3 trillion in this year alone because that will rise to $5 trillion over the next 10 years. We can reduce our deficit now by doing the right things that we could benefit from if we take immediate action and start planning for the next 10 years.  I would also like to point out that there are provisions in this bill that make that harder and would help make the cut even worse. The Bipartisan Budget Act changes the baseline so that revenues in the supplemental would go up in the first few years of a balanced budget. That is how the

My experience was that the public has not had that opportunity. It is my experience also that the public, the people who watch television and newspapers, see no reason to get involved in this or to receive it. Our Nation does not have to go to war in Iraq. It has not gone to war in Iraq. There is no reason to get involved in it. We are a nation of laws, and there are no laws that come before the American people.

We all know what the deficit is in America. I do not know how the big government crowd can come up with an even number on that one in America. But the Pentagon found that the whole picture around the Pentagon is now as bad as it was a few years ago. They are now digging debris from the World Trade Center site as a result of their failure to have adequate funding for the plane crash response and transportation of thousands of American citizens in that terrible attack on September 11, 2001.

The Coastal Plain Program is a well-known State-level program for preparing coastal areas for future floods. It supports facilities and infrastructure for diversifying flood damage, preventing flooding in coastal areas, and investing in a resilient coast for those areas that need it.

And that is to find a way to provide a safety net that will make people feel comfortable so they can leave the United States of America when they come back from a mission or the Lake of Fire.  I say to my friend from Ohio, ``I have given you the information that your feelings are something I hope you will share with the American people.''

That might be an argument in this body. If it is, then those who want to keep the status quo should have the opportunity to do so. But we are not going to make it easy to vote yes on a constitutional amendment and no on a nonconstitutional amendment. That means that the rules that are in force here now with regard to military base closures will apply to the constitutional amendment, not to the nonconstitutional amendment.

Mr. Speaker, some years ago in a notorious political murder case, the accused relied on false information to secure a release from jail while awaiting trial for murder. The law does not give prosecutors the right to keep the accused in jail as long as necessary in an effort to obtain information that might come to the defense if the government is finally able to present Congress.  It is not a Republican Democrat issue, Mr. Speaker. If Republicans want to take back this Congress they ought to vote ``yes'' to amendment No. 2201, Democrats ``yes'' vote ``yes'' amendment No. 2201.

Madam President, at the end of this session of Congress, one of the Senate's longest-serving members will be leaving Congress after more than three decades in this Chamber to be President of the United States of America. This Senator is Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts.  The years of service to this great country should not go unnoticed. I have noted the enormous contributions of Senator Kerry's father, Admiral John, in drafting the seven pillars of our Nation's defense policy. His political energy in the Senate has often been recognized as an example of the unique characteristics of the Senator from Massachusetts.  I first met Senator Kerry in 1971, when the young Senator was still in high school and he returned from a long term assignment in Vietnam.  I was impressed by Senator Kerry's firmness and persuasive manner. We quickly became best friends, and the spirit of compromise

And it is setting our Nation on a course to come together and do this on our own to bring an end to programs that have been wasteful or ineffective.  We have heard many talking points about wasteful programs. To me, the wasteful programs are programs that are wasteful for the average American taxpayer. This bill eliminates wasteful programs on discretionary spending programs and eliminates wasteful programs on entitlement programs. This bill eliminates wasteful wasteful programs on wasteful bureaucracy programs wasteful duplication of government.

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama, for the wisdom he has shown on the subject of national health care reform and the way he has helped us along in the process and for his leadership in the area of health care in Illinois.  Health care is a national problem that requires national solutions that will provide long-term health care security and health care opportunity for all the Nation's citizens as well as State and local officials to achieve.  Here in the Congress I believe that the challenge will be not only addressing health care security and long-term health care reform but addressing long-term speech and access to healthcare for all Americans. We are trying to protect the right to affordable and high-quality health care in this country, so there is a lot to be done here, as there is a lot to be done in

Mr. President, America's greatest asset is its people, and what makes the American population unlike any other is the dignity of its people in the sense that they are willing to fight for what is most important to their country. This country has struggled many times before in the culture wars about who is a patriot and who is not but has never been able to figure out who is right and who is wrong in that Nation and who are we.  Now we are at a crossroads in our Nation's history because our Government is being overrun in Hispanic America. Every American, Republican or Democrat, is dying in the streets of this country in the ghetto because the Government they pay their taxes to support is being overrun by the Government and by the Government bureaucracy.  If we don't get these citizens off of welfare and into work we will be spending today

I would just like to conclude this portion by including for the record the article in the June 27 issue of the March 22 New York Times by a national forum on education and paid parental leave for America's rising moms and dads that addressed paid family leave issues as well as corporate tax incentives for companies which encourage those companies to participate in family leave benefits and contributions and benefits to employees to those employees already already on private companies leave. Many corporations are making this decision based on these new practices of providing paid leave policies for their employees, and particularly for those with children.  So let's continue these conversations about education and paid parental leave. Let's continue this national dialogue to increase the quality of care for our children and to ensure their healthy and successful growth.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

They provide jobs to the local community in all parts of the country and for the service industry as well as the transportation and infrastructure industries that support the national economy and ensure that we can have a national and regional economy that works for all the American people. But there is important work to do in the transportation, infrastructure, and highway bills which we will be considering as we continue this bill today. I want to thank Chairman Frank, the chairman of our subcommittee, for working with us on several provisions that I believe are extremely important and which will help American communities be successful, strengthen our economy, and create good-paying jobs for hard-working Americans.

Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to rise today in strong support of the Mollohan and Wolf amendment to protect the port from an even greater threat to our national security and our economy from a Chinese nuclear bomb attack on this country or in the Western Hemisphere.  The language in the underlying bill is designed to permit the President to have some reasonable assurance that the United States will not be attacked by a nuclear community seeking to be part of a world control program, no matter how well meaning or how protected.  The support for this amendment is understandable.

Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4970, the House Majority's version of the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA. House Republicans have chosen to allow House Republicans to pass this legislation on a party-line vote without opposition and without the Speaker's consent. This allows House Republicans to continue to politicize VAWA without any input from the Congress. House Republicans have continually made this the low priority of their legislative agenda since the time that they controlled both Houses of Congress from 2001 to 2003. So it's rather astonishing that the majority has decided that we should not debate this important legislation.  Since 2001, VAWA has helped protect women's constitutional rights to private property rights, privacy, and equality. VAWA makes it easier for localities and States to establish and enforce domestic violence notification requirements. VAWA

Mr. President. 6 years ago this month, more than 100,000 Bahrainis of all ages and backgrounds came together to demand that their country recognize Israel as a state. On this day nearly 6 years ago, most Bahrainis supported the election of a new government headed by President Sheikh Khaled al-Khalifa and 50 of their nation's sons and daughters proposed an alternative to the corrupt and unpopular government of Prime Minister Abdullah Abdullah. They would offer recommendations to change the regime that oppressed their country and over the past 3 years has robbed it of nearly one-third of its oil wealth.  Sadly, that election was marred by violence and police mistreatment that gave the people of Bahrain's streets a reputation for chaos and unrest.

Mr. President, since 1994, the U.S. Government has provided tactical aerial intelligence assistance to the U.S.-supported military opposition in Afghanistan and the anti- drugs task forces in Central America to combat the narcotics trade that has once again dominated this region and the global narcotics marketplace.  The policy established by the Nixon administration of providing aerial intelligence support to help these counternarcotics missions was terminated under the Carter administration in 1980 after Vietnam had invaded Cambodia. Subsequently, the Reagan administration continued this policy of aerial intelligence support until 1992 when the United States conducted a limited aerial reconnaissance over the whole region. In fact, for the last 20 years, the number of CIA aerial missions in the region has dropped from 40 in 1975 to 3 today, and from 35 in 1991 to 2 this year.

It also sends some $14 billion over the next 10 years to the States for programs which will most likely be no more than temporary or less than an exercise in tepid tax increases.  H.R. 3415 represents more than $14 billion dollars per year per year per billion dollars per year per cents spent by the Federal Government on gas taxes. It would increase fuel prices in America from anywhere from $2 to $5 a gallon.

Mr. Speaker, more than half of the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans today for people making under $100,000 have nothing to do with cost-of-living increases or other ways of providing more money for people who make under $100,000 a year compared to average Americans or average percentiles. Most of the debate and criticism has focused on the size of the tax cut and the impact on those who make a living so high that they will be hard-pressed to be able to put a speaker in their garage or drive a car if they wanted to; that's the Republicans' problem.

Many of us that serve on the Republican side have personal memories of our dear friend from West Virginia. I am grateful for those memories because legacy matters.  He was a friend of mine when I was a freshman Member of this body, and that distinguished friendship has not waned. For his intellect and the strength of his conviction and for the strength of his character, those of us who serve here as Republicans have so much respect and so much admiration for the Senator from West Virginia.  So it is with great sadness that I rise tonight to inform our colleagues that the life of our

Mr. President, I would simply like to add my strong support for this bill and its provisions. One of the most effective tools we have against the terrorist threat in our country today is strong U.S. law enforcement. There is no more important bill in the area of national security legislation on the floor of the Senate. Every Senator has the right to offer amendments to the bill on any amendment he would like, but on this particular parcel of legislation, we need the agreement that they would agree to be presented for amendment and all debate be limited to 1 hour equally divided on the amendment and the bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

That is where we are, and the gentleman makes my point, and he makes it so well that it should be the subject of discussion during this time of process. We have both been there and both understand and are on the same page here about the fact that we want to get children on health care who are truly healthy. Our action here is a step in the direction of doing that and more than that is part of what this debate is about. But we should have a thorough assessment of what the results are and all of that, and we will have that.  One of the things that is so wrong, in my opinion, with all of these proposals on the floor, that is, those from the other side, is, when there are 60 votes in this body for something, there is a need to have a total movement

Madam Speaker, last month, Republicans voted to end Medicare. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, that would cut over $500 billion out of the future of the Medicare program over 10 years--far more than House Republicans have pledged to do or it would be more than $2 trillion in the black over the next 10 years. Speaker Ryan, the Democrat majority leader, and the Democratic leadership will make another big promise this week in the Senate as they seek to negotiate the Republican-only Budget Resolution and the GOP only tax cut proposal that includes those counties to keep Medicare in Medicare.  The GOP tax cut proposal repeals the Alternative Minimum Tax, which hurts small businesses and households alike, so that as we all pay payroll taxes, to extend the payroll tax for one more year we reduce their future revenue which would add to the national debt.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3348 demonstrates the lasting impact of the blizzard of 1996 when cities across the country experienced serious snowfalls, flooding, and highway closures.  As you may know, Hurricane Allison swept across the State of Maine and caused significant snowstorms that swept away roads and bridges that normally would not need snow blizzard conditions. The costs of this enormous winter storm against those States have really exceeded our expectations and our ability to adequately respond.  H.R. 3348 demonstrates that FEMA's response to the 1996 blizzard should be commended and that States that received considerable damage from this storm are among those whose people are now prepared to rebuild.

Madam President, as I said it is a question of how much do you cut spending to get deficit reduction; for example, will cutting spending $25 billion be $25 billion less than $25 billion less than $25 billion? I do not think that is a budget program that can meet the costs of government because the taxpayers expect that Congress be able to cut programs that they support to pay for the expenditures of $25 billion more than $25 billion in additional spending than $25 billion more than $25 billion in increased subsidies to the oil companies and to companies that ship jobs to China. Those are the programs which can be cut to pay for percent cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, education, roads and bridges, that will make programs less costly but save the taxpayers $25 billion in the bill.  There are very few things that

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The last time the House considered H.R. 2492, the EPA reauthorization bill for fiscal year 1995, we debated whether to waive President Clinton's Executive order to remove both United States and foreign chemical facilities from any new comprehensive regulation that the Clinton administration put into place last year for the Nation's chairman of the USIA. After we did not raise that issue this Congress, the Clinton administration put in its proposal that if Congress passed legislation that Obama would veto, that the President would waive the President's Executive order. Well, I regret that today there is no different standard, no different standard in this Congress. As you know, there is one standard that everybody seems to be in favor of. Unfortunately, for those of us who strongly believe in doing something about

Mr. Chairman, the House Committee on National Security leadership added $553 million for the long- lead agency for the Urban Area Security Initiative in fiscal year 1996 to support an $11 million increase in the ongoing Urban Area Security Initiative and the threat that cities and States face from terrorism and violent crime that is that a major terrorist attack will take place in a military base or airfield in an urban area. This additional funding increases the funding for the Urban Area Security Initiative by an estimated 1.4 percent, or $1.2 million, from fiscal year 1995 and $6 million more than the President requested.  While I have great concerns with the administration's proposal for programmatic changes, particularly since this funding level would expire 3 months from now, I must reluctantly support the House leadership's recommendation to add $2 million to the Urban Area Security

Mr. Speaker, the important part of this bill that is in the bill today is it would prevent a double counting of money for projects, much to the benefit of the American taxpayers, in the areas that I mentioned earlier.

Madam Chair, as we prepare to take up an important piece of legislation today, H.R. 956, Energy and Water appropriations legislation for the fiscal year 2017 fiscal year, I rise in support of this important bill because it contains $8 billion in funding for energy production by the Department of the Interior.  While this bill increases funding for this sector of the Federal Government, there are some important provisions that were left out of this appropriations bill. For example, the $400 million in funding for the Kaiparowits National Forest that was added during floor consideration last year would be rescinded.  In addition, the $2.8 billion in funding for the Wind Reservoir Restoration and Water Reclamation program would not be reallocated because the subcommittee did not provide enough funding to keep the program operational.

The Federal Aviation Administration's [FAA] proposed rule changes to airport noise control are both lengthy and costly. The Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] report entitled ``Rules for Changing U.S. Aviation Rules is a Waste of Time'' says that if the rule changes are proposed, noise control will slow FAA's fleet to a crawl. This means the FAA's own employees, which is so critical to providing optimum conditions for our planes, will not be able to deliver necessary air traffic control services.  This change would also mean significant toll collection and other miscellaneous costs for aircraft. I urge Members to oppose this rule change.
