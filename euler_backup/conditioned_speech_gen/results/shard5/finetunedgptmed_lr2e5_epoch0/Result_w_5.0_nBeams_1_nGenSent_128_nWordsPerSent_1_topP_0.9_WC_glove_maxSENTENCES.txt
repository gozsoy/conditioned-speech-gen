Mr. President, as our colleague and one of the ranking members of the Budget Committee recently noted during the Senate Finance Committee Budget Review Committee markup, the Senate bill on Medicare cuts $1 billion from the Medicare prescription drug bill by cutting spending for the program in excess of the $30 billion the Congressional Budget Office estimates it will cost this year and next year alone to implement those cuts. The Senate bill also increases the Medicare growth amendment for the 15 years between 1996 and 2002 from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent of the growth in Medicare. For those with incomes above $100,000, it increases by $4, an increase which the Congressional Budget

Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that the motion to instruct that was filed by the gentlewoman from Texas is identical to the motion filed by the majority side. The gentlewoman from Texas filed it earlier. And as a matter of fact, when we called up the motion to instruct that was filed on the Democratic side yesterday evening, which I guess made it even easier to file that motion, it was the gentlewoman from Texas and I filed the motion to instruct on the Republican side because they did not support it. So this is a noncontroversial motion to instruct that will not cause any trouble and will pass.  As a matter of fact

Mr. Chair, today we again vote against the Trump agenda on climate change in the House and the Senate. Let me be clear: Congress should not be doing politics by passing a new law that creates the wrong kinds of targets for a government mandate or that delays protecting vulnerable Americans. It is absolutely critical that we take action on climate change as a matter of urgency to stop further climate catastrophe before it reaches our coastlines and beyond. The proposed budget before us will do just that.  If we vote for this budget, we will ignore the strong consensus among experts in the field that climate change is real and dangerous and will have catastrophic consequences for the future of

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about a provision in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requiring Federal entities to provide for the cost-benefit analysis of certain greenhouse gas emission standards. This provision is in no way intended to affect other measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it represents a misplaced priority when debating energy policies. In my view, it undermines the fair and balanced process we use in setting policy, which does need to be done.  As Senator Hutchison pointed out in her amendment to S. 2407, a greenhouse gas emission standards require States and Federal entities to provide estimates for how emissions reductions can be achieved.

But for the last few days we have been very clear that we are not going to stop at just that one thing. We

Mr. Speaker, we come to the United States to seek human rights, yet millions of people across our hemisphere lack access to healthcare, medicine, education and employment opportunities. Human rights and health care don't always have one other thing in common.  And yet we are raising the expectations of health insurance. We are taking the fight to assert political power by maintaining high health care premiums.  The insurance industry is outraged about our willingness to do nothing. We could use the time and money to pass comprehensive health reform, which would benefit millions of Americans by lowering copays, deductibles and coinsurance. Instead, this administration is choosing the cheapest of all options

Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that America's midwestern farmers have endured a declining economy since 1980. In 1980 the value of their farm assets was $26 billion; by 2012 the value had dropped to $10 billion. Today there are 10,600 American farm families, all of whom say they can no longer make ends meet for the costs of the U.S. Government to maintain our common agricultural land. They may be in financial difficulty to pay for this Government program, but their Federal Government is not helping them in any way.  That is why on April 30, 2005, Congressman Francis Smith from California introduced the Organic Program Restoration Act.

One of the easiest ways for him to make those kinds of short-term gains is to delay Medicare and Social Security and to cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations.  But if our seniors and their families work longer hours and spend less money, they won't have as much money to spend on things like rent, food, and other necessities. That means the elderly in America can't make ends meet because they can't afford to live on their Social Security income.  We have all heard this joke before:

Madam Speaker, on the health care debate that is taking place in our country today, it is interesting to note that for the first time in years, the Congress could even send a resolution to the President that was focused on the issues of health care coverage for the people in our country. That is something that is very exciting in this Congress. We are here today not only to help the uninsured get coverage, we are here to help people like the taxpayers in this country to be able to see that the care that they get in our hospitals, in our doctors' offices and our other health care facilities that we provide the healthcare for all of our people is

There are many questions we could address on that that I can assure you we will not. But I will say that for the purposes of discussing the discretionary portion of our budget here, our budget has had it for 6 of the last 7 years.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Republican budget resolution because, again, it is a budget plan that takes the highest tax rate on working families, it takes away the most benefits to the families that are already struggling and that will likely rise because of the Republican budget proposals. And now it turns around and says somehow Democrats and Republicans can do it in a way that will stimulate growth and the economy and give tax cuts to working families and families that were working hard just a few years ago and are going to be struggling a great deal more than they are now. Now it starts back down the road of the Republican budget and says if you don't

<|endoftext|>Senate Republicans are looking to make history on the first day of this new Congress to achieve their largest tax cut in nearly a decade in the first real legislative gain of a new Congress in just 3 years.  Under the so-called American Health Care Act, the tax cut is a good example of why tax reform is so important to this new majority. The bill allows the child tax credit to be used on a per child basis rather than as a group tax credit. It eliminates the tax on investment income for all individuals instead of on a per couple basis for couples filing jointly, making it easier for all Americans to keep more of their money.
