It is home to some of the highest quality conservation and rehabilitation projects in our region.  The Great East Cleveland Regional Water System operates as a single distribution system that is connected through the small Lake Erie Nature Center. This distribution system, known as ``The Exchange,'' is managed by two Regional Water Administrations and by three landowners,

Mr. President, this amendment would make it possible for the Department of the Interior to issue technical assistance and other support to States that are working in the jurisdiction of a Federal land management agency under the act of May 10, 1955 and the lease agreement for the land to which the land relates or to another Federal agency that might use the land for their own use and their own friends and neighbors. This type of support is normally provided to States and counties in coordination with management agencies.  The change is needed for the following reasons:  First, the amendment would ensure that States and counties that are working with Federal land management agencies under the act of May 10,

The Mississippi Department of Public Broadcasting and the State University of New York at Stony Brook have jointly been designated as the National Association of Public Broadcasting Organizations by the Commission on Fiscal Responsibility undertaken in 1994.  The confederation's accomplishments should not be overlooked, and the people of Mississippi are obviously delighted that it has been designated by the Commission on Fiscal Responsibility. I would note that the confederation has a longer history of public broadcasting than even the American Broadcasting Company, which would be no surprise if the organization had not been

Mr. Speaker, earlier today I heard my colleagues debate whether we should raise the debt ceiling and if we should either increase spending or raise the debt ceiling to pay for it. I can say that each of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle has endorsed accountability and fiscal responsibility and that any strategy to reduce the debt must include that standard.  However, today in the Record, I came across some statements that may put me a little off track. I ask that you check it out.  First of all, in the Record today is the news story of the largest increase in student loan default rates in the history of our Nation's history. In short

The financial markets are vital to the stability of our economy, and just as important, they are expensive and time-consuming to defend. The report will tell you how best to protect ourselves against the financial harms that are created when fraud and fraud prevention measures are not in place.

It has failed because it goes back to the same thing we always do when the Congress does not do what we have asked for it to do for this extraordinary courage, for that American soul, and that is get out of there when the clock starts ticking down on somebody else's life.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to recognize the life and work of the late President Ronald Reagan who served us in this Chamber for many important years.  Some Americans have come to believe that Ronald Reagan is just a man, that he believed in common sense, and he would never have shown such a ruthless disregard for the truth. The truth is that Ronald Reagan, as we know, was born at Good Lady Aunt Betty Betty Truman Heidi Roosevelt Madame Tussauds. He was the first Republican President, and I will forever be proud of the fact that he never failed to live up to the high standards that we have been proud of.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would first like to commend my good friend from Michigan for his so-called Start-Up Tax Act of 2008 which we would support today as well in this House. It would not have been out of place in the one of the best children's books we have ever read, Bill Waterson's book, ``Hidden Figures,'' where the main character had only to comply with one Tax Code requirement. He had to comply with one set of Government Code rules and the other set of Government Code rules did not matter. He was very successful at it, and I thank him for that

Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill before the House today that would have the effect of overriding the authority of the United States Conference of Mayors in part of this bill. The California Urban Renewal District No. 5 and all California communities have worked together in the past to save hundreds of millions of dollars through the Texas Renewable Energy Law and the Clean Air Act and are living their families' work. But the CAUDDC is allowed to be the last finalist for this money from the 10 States and Washington, DC. Now I understand that the CAUDDC has so far met a particular requirement, and the way in which it

<|endoftext|>I have not seen it today as I would like to see it. I wonder how many votes there are going to be today? As you mention, if the Senator from Illinois would like to come to the floor to speak for a few moments about this bill, let me make a couple of points that I think will get Hatch's attention as well.  Number one, you mentioned this morning that it has been a 7-year program. It has been very successful in getting to the point where the cost is lower and we do not have to do the most expensive contracts overseas. What we did not do was, under a very complicated legal

Mr. Speaker, I am here to express my support for legislation I have introduced that will make higher education more affordable in rural areas and also our Nation's public schools.  Rural communities rely on Federal aid to sustain school district budgets, as well as for property taxes and tourism assistance to finance school operations and maintenance. Agriculture, forestry, the natural environment, health care, and other spending must be balanced in order to ensure that all communities, regardless of the size of the government, have access to needed resources. This is why I introduced the The Rural Student Loan Guarantee Act.  In 2005, Congress established a five-year loan guarantee program to encourage

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise concern about the Russian approach to the Middle East Peace Process and whether the United States will continue to support our partners there as they strive to peace out of conflict and political instability and support peace and stability in that part of the world and future generations. I would like to share some of the events and conversations I have had with my good friend and colleague from New Jersey just recently who was picked as Secretary of State of the G8.  The Russian approach to the Middle East Peace Process has been astonishing, and it is shocking that the President, the two people who call themselves President, the President himself, the Secretary

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to share with my colleagues the courageous work of four days in my district, which involved numerous volunteers, gentleman mayors, educators, city council members, and other members of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation as well as of the Speaker and the Ways and Means Committee.  Let me just say, with all due respect to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Smith), this is not an easy time to be here. This has been a very difficult hour, trying to find common ground with some of the freshmen in this House, most of whom are Republican freshmen who have been here before us. This is an important day,

<|endoftext|>Higher education is one of the biggest job creators in this country and this job tax relief is a way to provide for those people who work hard to make sure that all Americans have the education they need to compete and to grow our economy. Higher education has more than 45 percent of the job growth. And we have got a job tax credit. It's not just in college, it's really nationwide. And we provide for this through legislation in the Budget Control Act we passed this year. And what we're doing with this resolution today is again in order to help lower-income families and those who work hard to take care of themselves and their

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Delaware?  There was no objection.   302. The title of the bill is United States Energy Research and Development Act of 1995.       H.R. 2670 is identical to the cell phone bill as amended by S. 1362.       The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time,
