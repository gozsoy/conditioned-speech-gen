government budget statistics 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have expressed strong support for the deficit reduction package being proposed by the Budget Committee and Congressmen Cardin and Skelton in the Senate today. This is not the time to stop paying down the Government debt and that is what this budget will do. We have to correct this problem in a way that ensures that we are not spending too much of the economy and that we are not spending too much of the national budget in statistics that are not credible.  So when we look at this budget, we have two major things we have to realize. First of all, this budget will save one-sixth of our Federal budget, and that is not much. If you add up all of the unspent money in the Government, it is $

But when we come to votes, we try to make sure that there is an agreement where the priorities are fairly identified, and so that we can get people to yield to us.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

legislation america immigration 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, our current immigration system is a travesty. It is inefficient, uncompassionate, and dangerous. It has created an enormous burden on our citizens and immigrants who are already here and who will likely be here for a while more if this legislation is signed into law. Even more disturbing are the consequences to those who will be here for generations to come as a result of this law and the future of America.  For over 700 years, the United States has been a Nation of immigrants. Immigrants come to this country on a temporary basis, often in search of a better life for themselves and for their families. In this era of war and conflict, a time when citizens are called to serve, it is no surprise that the need for immigrants and for refugees, both those who are coming from Europe and those who are still in need of an opportunity to

Mr. President, we will return to the consideration of H.R. 2 this morning. Last night, the Senate voted on amendments on four separate issues relating to criminal justice reform and related legislation dealing with police reform and reform of our criminal justice system that did not include any measures that would have addressed the issue of police violence and terrorism in our country and that will not allow us to address that security problem in this country. One amendment was offered by Senator Coleman of Mississippi, and the one to which I objected came from Senator Lautenberg. This amendment would have been to create a program similar to the Unsafe Drugs Act, which created a safe harbor for activities such as illicit gambling or the sale of controlled substances. It also created a new program which does not have anything to do with America's drug laws, but instead builds on existing law enforcement efforts to

Mr. Chairman, our Nation faces a financial crisis of epic proportions. According to a recent study by the World Health Organization (WHO), childcare and other personal care spending is expected to triple over the next 2 decades, a drastic increase that will have enormous consequences for our children, our families, our businesses and our communities.  This increase in childcare costs will also have a devastating impact on the working poor.

I will be talking about this in more detail later on the floor because the truth is, consumers need information that is up to date and correct as soon as they make a payment. That information can include the names of businesses and people on Social Security that may have been impacted by the Commerce Department's now infamous ``gutting'' of Caller ID.  Since there is no longer any way to verify a caller's identity, many States require the use of such services. My home State of Wisconsin recently passed a resolution to provide consumers with those services. Yet, it was not widely reported in the media and reported poorly.

I am, indeed, the author of this bill that I know that it has nothing to do with one new professor but would simply be a matter that is appropriate under the circumstances that we are dealing with right now. It should not be subject to question and is not even part of the continuing resolution.  In other words, this new faculty is created by a new report that has not been approved by the new York school district. They go to a school district that was not able to approve it. What is happening is that they have created an expectation that these really federally funded teachers, these low-paid, are going to come in and show them this on a regular basis, show them that they are not necessarily the only ones that the kids in the school district depend on.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee for yielding me time.

FEMA has spent over $1.5 million on equipment and training just to prepare the State of New Jersey, and that is without a Federal seat of Federal powers, without congressional permission to use the funds from the

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the question of most-favored-nation tariff status for China.

As I stated during the hearing I held last week in front of the Commerce Committee, the Congress has the power to impose tariffs on imports and exports on a wide range of goods from the globe, including cars, jet fuel, avionics, clothing, and furniture.  This debate has focused on policy because the U.S. Congress has an obligation to the American people to ensure that our exports can be exported to countries that are more free from the threat of unfair and oppressive trade

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, some of the most successful small businesses in America originate with an entrepreneur who spent most of his life in the public sector. As the last week before the recess has ended, we continue to see this emerging industry expanding rapidly to meet changing manufacturing needs in our world today.  That is why this year we are working on legislation that will create an opportunity for more business and more innovation in this country and help process that growth. To further the important role that small businesses play in providing the entrepreneurial opportunities necessary to attract new entrepreneurs, Congress created the Small Business Research and Development Education and Other Fund to provide students with training on how to develop and market small businesses.  This legislation also expands small businesses and gives businesses greater incentive to invest in their own development of the next generation of the small business. We are working with the business

The Nation learned the President asked a handful of National Security Advisors to approve the use of the Bush administration's so-called anti- troubling intelligence measures against the people of Iran to pressure the Congress and intimidate Iranian and European leaders into passing an illegal nuclear accord. And apparently the very thing that the President asked the advisers to do was to demand the intelligence agencies' approval to send troops to Bosnia.  In doing this, the President deliberately called on the only opposition forces in the Balkans, the Serbs, and the Albanians. The danger of Mr. Bush's design to blame the Serbs and the Albanians, for the genocidal war in Bosnia, is not minuscule. No doubt our leaders in the Balkans would be angry, calling for the so

Mr. President, America has come a long way in addressing discrimination in the workplace since the Equal Rights Amendment of 1964 was enacted into law by Congress on May 8, 1964. Since that time, millions of women have made significant changes in their lives in a struggle to restore the dignity and power of the women's vote to women in this country, the rule of law in the workplace, and the rights of every American citizen.  I believe the landmark social justice legislation passed by the United States House of Representatives of 1965 as well as the Irish language provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 constitute a bedrock in the treatment of women. These measures are long overdue and deserve bipartisan support, and I expect that they will be effective if we pass them.  In order to act, however, we have to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act,

All of the amendments are in the amendment that is in the bill that the Department of State has just been about to present to the American people so they can see how this is going to impact them in this small change. But the amendment that has been developed in these two bills also has a very aggressive and significant cost increase, so this amendment comes at an especially high cost.  If this amendment is adopted, all of these concerns we have are alleviated by the fact that we are going to be dealing with four amendments, even though there are no revenues to offset that that should offset the major increase that comes from these four amendments.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, gas prices are at a record high, at over $3 per gallon. Yet the gas tax has fallen so low and consumers have had little time to find a high-priced gas pump since this tax was last proposed in 1993. In the meantime, over 700 Members of Congress have visited a gas station to see if foreign prices are keeping up with domestic prices. However, most of the members of Congress who visited gas stations, as we see now, were complaining about the President's tax hike that caused gasoline prices to skyrocket.  Mr. Speaker, I heard so many problems when the President's gas tax increased, including a growing number of auto companies in my congressional district, and a few independent companies that generate zero jobs.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would like to also recognize the work that the other members of the committee have done in this legislation as well as the important work the Secretary has done as well. We have more important work to do because Congress and the American people are really paying for this that they have made a decision to act.  Let me just state that this is a historic piece of legislation and a priority bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

As I said a few minutes ago, on our side there is real angst as a result of the last year of the last year of the Obama administration here at home and in this country that has brought all this angst about cost cutting and these corporate welfare programs where the same people who have been coming here since he first came here just had to pay more just for the same things that have been said in this last year about this administration because they had been getting more years ago here and they needed to see a return on their investment. So it is a real stage of anxiety and concern.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

But I also think it is important to note that smoking does no harm to the health of any Member of this body. Therefore, I do not agree with the amendment, and, therefore, I will support the amendment.  I have to say that Senator Robb and Senator Reid have been excellent advocates of this particular amendment.

Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Budget Act of 2018.  Despite the overwhelming majority of Congress supporting the House Joint Resolution for the Budget, and the administration and its own budget that actually attempts to deal with the President's own budget and the policy making process, this resolution essentially puts all executive orders into an omnibus appropriations bill.  The only exceptions made in this resolution are for two rule changes in the President's budget: one that would allow for reconciliation with past fiscal years, and one that would expand agency budget authority.  The White House's Executive Order, already put into law by President Trump, includes $700 billion in unobligated balances for fiscal year 2018 and $100 billion for fiscal year 2019. In the President's budget, the so-called Dream Act, the

President Bush has nominated John McCain to be a Federal judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States of America since the end of last year. As ranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator McCain's service to this institution and to our country is unparalleled.  After entering the Senate in 1978, Senator McCain served for 6 years as a member of the Budget Committee. In that time he moved from subcommittee chairman to the full committee ranking member, where he worked in a bipartisan manner to craft budget legislation. During his 6 years as chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator McCain advanced a number of significant initiatives for improving our Nation's budgeting, and I applaud his dedication and all of

Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor and support the McConnell amendment. This amendment establishes a balanced budget amendment that will strengthen the Senate by requiring Congress to take account of future budgetary needs of both current and future generations. The McConnell amendment also increases accountability and transparency by giving consumers control over their financial affairs and reforming the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.  As a former member of the House Financial Services Committee, it is critical that we reexamine the role of Government in all aspects of their lives, including food, medicine, housing, and any other type of economic activity that they engage in. Many Americans worry that the Federal Government, through the Federal Reserve, the Federal Government, does not have the time to responsibly manage their finances. The McConnell amendment, on the other hand, would allow families to be better informed about the retirement age

Mr. Speaker, a government spokesman has said people from poor countries are taking jobs and that they are putting government in crisis. But the reality is that jobs and prosperity are growing across poor countries, and the fact is it's not happening in our own backyard.  The benefits of job creation are not concentrated in America's slums and inner cities. Nationally, job growth has been strong--more than 800,000 private sector jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figure is far higher than some are counting. The U.S. Department of Commerce, in its statistics, show that American jobs have expanded at a rate of more than 100,000 per month since September 2000. So American jobs are growing. American companies are moving the people they employ to the place where the benefits are great.  According to the

His concerns about the planned cuts in certain programs in this bill are well-founded. This is a bipartisan bill, but this, sadly, is not a bipartisan bill. The truth is, I don't think we as Members of the Senate and the House are at the same stage of ideological debate and disagreement that we were a few weeks ago.

Madam President, for those Americans who believe the Senate was going to have a debate on paid leave for workers on the Senate floor today and we are not paying attention to it, we would be wrong and Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle would have a debate on paid leave and issues of fairness. And because they care about that and care about the taxpayers who are footing the bill for them all day and all night and who pay the bill for Medicare seniors to get health care when they should get it when they are sick, we are going to have a debate on paid leave. And we are going to have a debate on health care reform. I have heard a lot of rhetoric around the time of the New York Times editorial that this Republican bill is going to break the back of America. My grandparents were poor. My grandfather

They have their own rules and we try to respond accordingly to these needs so they can interact effectively with those in their own countries so that they can respond reactively.  Madam President, I have to say that I think it is one of those things we do need to take into consideration, particularly in those times when we have the massive obligations that we are facing and our young people are out there, and

During the 6-week season, the White House had sent out gifts and loans to help small businesses in order to help those who had lost their homes.

They go to work and they are given a salary of $25 an hour and have their children go to school every other day and they have to go out and take care of women and children and they are not compensated for it.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, this past weekend I spent part of the weekend down in the Tropics. The only place I could visit on the east coast was up here in the Atlantic where the two storm systems rolled in, the convention of the Atlantic after a couple of weeks of getting up out here in the Sun on their way to beating the world on a large storm and the other side coming to beat us on a smaller one and then back to back and so they were both not being fought off guards.  And I just thought of a storm that is raging across our tropical neighbors. Every night it is growing and moving and breaking over northern Florida, and then the rest of the country as it slowly sweeps north through our region.  At some point, somehow that hurricane will touch down in my area. Hurricane Cindy is raging on the Gulf Coast,

The reason it took a year and a half for this program to have a name was because of hard work by my office. The Tax Fairness Program is an important part of the defense security budget and was authorized as part of the President's fiscal year 1996 budget request.  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I stood by during the Committee markup and as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic Policy and Oversight.

Mr. Chairman, the bill before us tonight would elevate energy production above all other uses and create jobs and provide our Nation with a chance to fulfill its natural resources and enhance public health and safety. For the next 40 years this plan is a game changer for all of our children and our future generations. And once and for all, we must continue to support research and development activities in the areas of energy and environmental protection and increase the use of new energy technologies to bring energy into the world at affordable prices and bring down our energy costs. Interior status of biofuels offers American consumers the opportunity to grow their own, and do it without carbon taxes and burdensome regulations.  Biofuels are used in a variety of applications, from homes and commercial vehicles to the, primarily, feedstocks for cars and trucks. This is an

I would remind the House and the Nation the white power salute was not bestowed upon us before the birth of the American people by the honor and the fine name of our Nation before any Indian, any other national or any other race was removed from the face of the Earth. It was taken from them because they were not loyal to the United States, because they were not Americans, because they had no rights.  I would remind the House and the Nation that we were not in the Caribbean, we were in England, France and the United States, and they did not then appropriate the flag which has great meaning

Now, this document that the 28 advisers--let me indicate who some of these people are, in my office when we get an intelligence briefing: Mike McConnell, Robert Gates, and others who have been working on Iraq for 3 years. Then there is the Iraqi Command and Security Forces who took charge of the military in Baghdad this past weekend. It is a powerful defense unit.  The Hanoi Review Group also has a special charge, as part of their work, to try to, if we can, do a big adjustment for the Iraqis to actually integrate a fuller and more confident, strong, cooperative community of Iraqi leaders, both Sunni and Shia, in the Iraqi political process. So we all hope that as we do this, we will get an understanding.  I would like to see the Khazarian mafia, as well as the

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to act today to require the Bush administration to adopt a plan to limit the effect of homeland security spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid, in order to keep costs affordable for seniors and Medicare beneficiaries.  Medicare, Medicaid, and Medicare prescription drugs are the beneficiaries of these cuts. Medicare beneficiaries have already lost Medicare Advantage premiums for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries must find other Medicare beneficiaries to pay their Medicare premiums so Medicare beneficiaries must pay more Medicare premiums because Medicare premiums have gone up Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare beneficiaries Medicare Medicare beneficiaries Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare Medicare hmos

That has to be the beginning of a debate for the remaining Senators to talk about who are the fiscal responsible people for the country that are the first to propose the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America in the committee?  As we are voting in the last hour to go over to this debate, we are looking at a bill we would use for the whole country, another bill for the executive branch, another bill for the State Government, another bill for the Federal Government, another bill that would raise the Federal debt by 1 percent.

In the last decade, the drug problem in Australia has reached epidemic proportions, and it is for this reason that we in Congress and, I hope, the American people, will urge the government of Australia to

The legislation also includes provisions which allow business owners to deduct sales or purchase costs and investments before determining if any taxes are due.  Let me be clear.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about one of the greatest threats to the health and safety of this Nation today, and that is the worldwide health crisis that we have created in the United States of America and our incredible national debt. President Trump has great experience when it comes to the Nation's health problems that are on our national priorities, and one of the greatest of those is addiction and substance abuse.  Last year, the Republican majority passed a bill that had devastating effects for the majority party in this country and also for the country's drug warriors. That bill would have turned the harsh, cynical attitude of being drug-free into a prescription for treating and deterring addiction. It would have turned that drug warrior in the House of Representatives, Jack Cox, into one of the true doctors in the country. He came up with

Mr. President, to commemorate Public Recognition Week, the Vermont Federal Executive Association--VTFEA--recognized the more than 6 million Americans who have made public service their first professions. They have been at the forefront of the fight for health care and equality for all Americans since the team at VTFEA first introduced Public Recognition Week in 1987. While these contributions have had a long and remarkable legacy in Vermont and across this country, Citizenship Day and Public Recognition Week are distinct events that better reflect Vermont and the great public service that our citizens do each and every day in the Transportation Security Administration.  I want to thank VTFEA Chairman, Bob Farmer, and the members of the Vermont delegation for spearheading this year's celebrations and State legislature. While I didn't hear from Vermont in the field, I am grateful for the opportunity to congratulate the VT Transportation Security Officers

Mr. President, in May, after weeks of Democratic efforts, Congress extended unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed for another 2 weeks under the extended economy recovery bill. Unemployment compensation was especially important to many unemployed in Nebraska who would have benefited from the help they have been waiting for. Unemployment benefits cost our economy about $23 billion a year, and unemployment rates in recent downturns have fallen significantly.  But the bill expired at the end of May, and it was getting to be difficult for Senator Biden to get Democratic Senators to vote for this bill.

Mr. Speaker, the idea of trying to go along with the President's call for a government shutdown doesn't make any sense.  We should do something to try to avoid the shutdown which is on the horizon, and we ought to pass the right budget and do the right things.

It is similar to legislation Senator McCain and I have offered to the administration for several years. The Information Technology Select Committee on the Senate Finance Committee filed a similar amendment last year.  The Joint Committee on Taxation provided tax information as part of its most recent budget report and will continue to do so.

Mr. President, let me briefly speak to the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina regarding war pension legislation. The amendment that has been offered by the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Michigan would strike the tax provisions of the legislation, which would be $13 million in additional taxpayer subsidies to those companies. It also goes a long way toward eliminating the war credit, so it is an entirely separate amendment.  The answer, unfortunately, is no. We have now come down to an agreement that doesn't affect taxes at all, and there is no doubt that tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans will go forward. I think it is unfortunate that we have to offer an amendment that would do so.  The real issue here is to find a bipartisan solution that offers fairness and fairness to those who are hurting the most, with tax breaks

I would just conclude by saying that I not only speak of this for my colleagues in the Republican caucus but for all Americans in general because we should not turn our backs on this law when we will not follow it if we do not know the facts on it and we should not conclude that the way to address this is not to cut $700 billion from education. It is not that we should turn our backs on education, although that is the primary way that we ought to go in our efforts on this bill. I want to encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the amendment offered by Florida Senator Marco Rubio.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I am hopeful we will approve tonight a bill I have authored with Senator Landrieu of Louisiana, and we hope we can have the bill voted on in the next few hours. The unanimous consent agreement with the Judiciary Committee was amended on which Senator Landrieu authored a provision that would allow her to offer amendments in a matter of hours. I wanted to be more specific.  The bill Senator Landrieu has worked on, and others, would allow one Senator to offer an amendment, with 1 hour between the introduction of the amendment and its consideration by the full Senate. For example, if two Senators are to offer the same amendment, each would have to present the same presentation and have it debated for 60 minutes. As a result, Senators would have some opportunity to offer and debate their amendments. The prerog

They just had the Federal Government run up the costs and they ran up the costs for health care for the government employees and for all the public employees because the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that has jurisdiction over that office was overrun by the EPA.

Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate, on behalf of myself and Senator Obama, my distinguished chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman and Senator Graham of the Armed Services Committee support for the President's proposal to increase the homeland security investment fund by $2.5 billion. These additional funds will provide critical funding for the creation of a new national transportation security fund.  The current homeland security investment fund is set to expire on March 31, 2012. That leaves a gaping hole in the American infrastructure that we need to fill. Our infrastructure, like bridges, rail lines, waterways, airports, and highways, are essential to the maintenance of our Nation's safety.  This increase in funding will strengthen our national infrastructure so that our people can travel safely and safely across the United States of America. Last month, the Department

These individuals have come to me to advocate that we should have a Federal law or standard governing our health care providers. I reluctantly believe that this is a good idea. I would be willing to work with them in any way we can to improve the welfare of our Federal employees through new incentives and new standards for Federal employees health care facilities.

Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment with where we find ourselves on the floor of the Senate with regard to President Trump's infrastructure plan. The $5 billion in tax cuts that we are considering today are much more than what has been requested in the appropriations bill. This $5 billion is the equivalent of nearly $6 million for Louisiana to build a new bridge, construction of which is denied under the motion to proceed to the bill. It is a $1 billion tax cut for the most powerful corporation in the world, a corporation with a billion employees that would be allowed to write off 1,300 percent of its effective tax rate to avoid paying taxes on $30 billion in income--who just voted to increase gas prices at the pump? That is not infrastructure, this is our tax cuts for the oil industry.  Unfortunately

Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight to debate this most important provision of the highway bill that is currently before the Senate for the first time in many years. I have the distinct honor of serving as the state chairman of the transportation and infrastructure committee in this important forum of vital legislation for the citizens of New Jersey and for the Nation as a whole. I am here today as a cosponsor of this program, the Automatic State Transportation Program, and to point out some of its important and critical achievements.  I would like to start by noting that the highway bill passed by the Senate this week contains $13.8 billion for highway construction and operation during the next 7 years. It increases that bill by more than $1 billion to pay for the projects that will open new highways and improve road safety.  Many of us here

It predicts that, if we proceed with this bill, the House would pass a continuing resolution and then begin to unravel the debris left by those who voted for the continuing resolution the last time around. And I thought to say, Mr. Speaker, that most of us who support a balanced budget amendment, as you do, support a continuing resolution that repeals the tax cuts for millionaires, cutting taxes for middle class families and small business in order to create the resources needed to put those folks back to work.

Mr. Chairman, I strongly support Mr. DeFazio's amendment to provide an additional 26 weeks of bankruptcy protection to consumers in the plan option who want to sell their home to pay for a mortgage or to make additional monthly payments to pay off a new mortgage or to provide for some other living expenses. If there are none left after 26 weeks, those of us who are already paying off some of the debt and the pay off of some of the debts are in a much better position than those workers who are unemployed today, who are suffering under the current unemployment rates. Mr. DeFazio's amendment will provide most of the benefits of his bill to our unemployed workers.

The President has proposed to address these basic challenges by strengthening America's overseas presence with an investment of over $8 trillion to build and support the implementation of overseas activities of the United States.  The President's proposals for American investment in foreign operations support more than a dozen different strategies, all directed at increasing U.S. economic growth abroad, enhancing American competitiveness in international trade, building manufacturing jobs in America, and fostering American investment in foreign Government, economic and financial institutions.

Mr. President, let me also thank my colleagues from West Virginia and North Dakota for their continued commitment to making sure that we pay for the President's economic plan by keeping taxes low, reducing government spending, and making investments that will promote economic growth and improve America's quality of life. This bipartisan effort is in the long-term transportation and infrastructure bill.  There are a number of riders to this plan, but the most important one is ``Safety in Overcoating.'' That is not just a new transportation language that will take a key ridership off the table; it is a new safety program, expanding the definition of overcoating to include an increase in the purity of construction material. In other words, the company can make the term ``overcoated'' as small as possible while still creating the air flow that is needed

Madam Speaker, it is very apparent, I think, to everybody out there that is seeing the debate that we are having here today that the House is not making enough progress in health care reform legislation and that it needs to make significant improvements to make it as good and as successful as possible for this Nation in public health and for our economy and for the people in our country who are trying to make it work and have made it work over the past 4 years.  We have only been able to advance, I think in Congress, on the most modest of reforms of how health care is delivered.

But if we do not get votes on it in time for debate later today and tomorrow and over the weekend and all of next week and next month and next year and next year after that health care debate where we debate it over and over again and then do nothing to improve health care for our families and to pay for it that we had in Medicare and Medicaid, where there are Republicans and Democrats who want to fix the problem, but we cannot do that, we cannot take care of the problem, we cannot allow it to become part of the Federal budget, and we cannot even offer amendments, then we will fail. That is the point I wanted to make.  So when I hear

Mr. President, the Constitution provides the Senate with a responsibility to evaluate Presidential nominations.

This responsibility for the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is entrusted to the Federal Judiciary Committee and acts as an independent check on the Executive branch's nominations.  The process we will use for the confirmation process of these Federal judges must meet the rules of nomination and be consistent with the Constitution. These rules of nomination must be careful to ensure no unconstitutional or unusual judicial activity is in order, but, in my view, they also assure an honest review of the nomination by Senate Democrats.

What I think is exciting is that, you know, we are affecting the hospitals and clinics across the country as we speak so we are actually preventing heart attack insurance coverage for many patients who are just being in the process of getting their medical care for the first time, and so doctors are being trained now to have more patients who are going to be able to get access to care than ever before in hospitals and clinics because we are preventing it in this legislation. I think that that is what the American people are really looking for. They want to be able to come to see their doctors and have the high-quality care that they are waiting for. I do think that Americans in the great State of New York, California, and other places are being very excited about this legislation that is coming to the floor in Congress to improve and make health

The States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut have been reauthorized for the past 5 years, but the State of New York has not been.  There is no excuse in the world for this injustice.

If we are successful in incorporating these plans undertaken before 1991, then the men and women in the Corps and the Guard will have time to fully prepare and then be ready to provide for contingencies that will happen.

Yet despite the civil rights civil rights legislation of the 1970's and the Justice Department amendment that outlawed discrimination based on race and national origin, the level of personal security required to confront the crime of violence continues to worsen in our country.  It has taken police officer after police officer to expose white-collar crime bosses.

There was a question raised by the Chair as to whether we would be able to get to that vote and to that vote have a defense authorization agreement in that State of the Union Message after those benchmarks that were set in the security council resolution.  The information that was provided to us is that the military forces deployed in Iraq and Syria did not take military action and have troops that may be present on the ground, are under notification, and do not necessarily know that the American people are there and that we are there.  I had said the administration was clearly proceeding in its assessment that there would be some military action and some formal request for an authorization for an attack by United States forces in Iraq and Syria.

But why is there such a delay with H.R. 4970? And why is it a hoax that no President has signed into law? This bill has been called a tough on crime bill by opponents of this bill.  In addition to giving more resources to law enforcement, the bill allows in the investigations of abusive, domestic violence, and stalking incidents, and it increases penalties for many of the crimes against women that are in the criminal justice system.

The march was a very important step forward for those of us who care deeply about human rights issues and the rule of law in that country. It would take more than 20 years to implement recommendations made by the Arab League for reform of the Bahraini Government. However, that march was a pivotal step. The regime has squandered the long time that would have been necessary for it to take these steps, but it can change for the better.

I thank the Senator from Michigan for his remarks. Let me assure him that I understand that there is a lot of rancor in the Senate about the role of politics in medicine. But I think that the Senator is probably on to something that he knows nothing about or about the Illinois legislature where he graduated from college and where there is some effort to undermine the Nebraska State Legislature and Michigan State Legislature, as well as the Federal Legislature that has contributed in various ways to this body. So I thank him for his remarks.  I thank the Senator for the time, and I yield the floor.

When you sit here and listen to people talk about these jobs and their incomes and jobs and their salaries that are going up every day and you say to yourself that companies are looking for people and they are looking for more young people and they are creating more jobs than ever before in history, that yields to us a reality that we are just getting started on because America has a long way to go in terms of what we need to do to get people back to work. Mr. MacDonald talked about the deficit. He talked about the impact on America. He talked about how we cannot live by our own budget numbers.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 3415, the temporary gas tax repeal, election year tax increase provision that will cost gas businesses and consumers billions of dollars in higher prices that will make it much harder for small businesses and workers to afford gasoline and other energy programs.  I was pleased to work with Congresswoman DeGette on an emergency energy bill which would have limited the tax penalty on domestic oil earnings of $6 per barrel on heating oil and $10 per barrel cents on oil from liquefied natural gas. But I am also encouraged by the bills that have passed this body so far that would phase out the tax penalty for all energy producers. In fact, I think the bill is pretty close to that at this point.  But this bill is identical to last year's Emergency Transportation and Hazardous Materials Resolution of the House.

It is time to debate the spending cuts which will be proposed by Speaker Gingrich, and to demand that these cuts be paid for as part of an agreement on raising the minimum wage, raising the child tax credit, and extending unemployment insurance.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I have had the good fortune of coming to the Congress in 1987 and 1991 and now going back to work again in 1993 and 1994 because of my good friend from California Senator Boxer and the Senator from New Jersey Senator Kerry and his leadership in the conference committee that negotiated these changes to accompany our NAFTA agreement.  Those changes created jobs in the manufacturing sector and gave American workers the opportunity to make a more secure and comfortable life. They built our highways and transit systems, they developed our small businesses, the spurs in job creation and the type of manufacturing that American workers would go to the United States to do the work.  Over the course of nearly a quarter century, most of us who served on the Democratic side of the aisle, Senator DeWine, and Senator Johnson, agreed that the United States would in

We will not be able to get it done without a real legislative agenda that will start to make things better for hardworking Americans who want to make sure they have a job and the things they need to go to work every day to do just that without fear that they will not talk to their Representatives about it.  Just last week Speaker Boehner suggested the Republicans were prepared to pass a budget in just 3 weeks because it is ``incredibly irresponsible.'' This is irresponsible, because we know Republicans have the Senate majority. They have the White House and the majority and the White House and the majority. They control both the House and the Senate. It is irresponsible to

The Federal Violence Against Women Act is a good and overdue step to end hate crimes. Unfortunately, there is still room for reform.

Mr. Speaker, one of the most absurd and destructive plans being touted by out-of-touch socialists is the so-called gas tax on oil and natural gas, which will further devastate the State of New Mexico and will cause us great environmental and economic harm if it is passed into law.  It is beyond argument that the oil and gas industry is too big to fail and should not be owned by an ever-more-powerful District. Right now, the people of New Mexico have taken the American people and turned them into an army of corporate bureaucrats.  Since the turn of the century, New Mexico has experienced a 5.5-percent unemployment rate and a nearly $4 trillion, 14-percent debt that our beloved Federal Government has not been able to pay.  That's right, the people of New Mexico are falling for the socialist

We have men and women around the world who work hard to keep America secure and focused on the things that we both truly care about: defending the Nation and its freedom.  These individuals work tirelessly to assist in maintaining democracy and freedom in their home countries, such as in El Salvador.  Mr. President, we cannot ignore the contributions of the Salvadoran military and civil society and this Nation's pursuit of peace and democracy.  In fact, in recent years the Salvadoran military has been one of the few combat-ready countries in the hemisphere. In 2017,

I see this bill very vividly, Mr. Speaker. This is legislation that reflects a commitment that this House has demonstrated by passing legislation in 1998 to make American snowstorms work.  Snowstorms during the coldest winter months in my career were a phenomenon that gripped the Snow Blizzard Act in 1978, making it far less affordable for utilities, homeowners, businesses and others to maintain the facilities that created them.  This bill builds on that program and provides additional funding for snow-making projects and fire suppression equipment.  Much of this work and much of this opportunity will also come with costs that are not considered in the government tax-incentive system. These costs include liability of utility,

promise young rise

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise for Young Americans Act of 2007. This legislation will make it possible for all to become good citizens and achieve their full potential without significant financial burden or financial commitment to higher education.  The promise that we have made to the many young Americans that rise to be part of this Nation is of enormous importance to our future as a nation, not only to the country at large but to their children and grandchildren. It is important to note that while students receive substantial financial assistance, they also face significant barriers that impede their success in America.  However, there are certain measures to make sure young people who succeed in this country have access to the things they are owed by their parents and community. H.R. 6 will correct this problem by establishing a National Performance

Although firefighters can increase the number of resources available to them through grants or contract work funding, they will still have to compete with State and local governments for funds in every State and city in the Nation to meet these needs. In addition, State and local governments will have to create new funds for Maryland and the District of Columbia.  This amendment will help fund a $18 million over 6 years grant to the Maryland Fire and Emergency Management Authority. This grant program provides for the collection of fines, fines assessed, arrest warrants, and costs. The grant funds will go to fund the administration and operations of a firefighter grant program that currently funds 50,000 firefighters across the country.

I wish to commend the bill's sponsors for their work on this issue and urge them to continue to work on the Copyright Term Extension Act.  The purpose of the Copyright Term Extension Act is simple: to extend the statutory term of the ``fair use'' exception, established in the first Congress of this Republic, so that every new song or phrase that enters our culture during the next 10 years will continue to have the statutory rights of the author and the publisher.  Unfortunately, the Copyright Term Extension Act has been too frequently interpreted to include too much new copyright terms. The Copyright Term Extension Act is intended to be temporary. I agree with my colleagues from Florida and California that some authors will lose their copyright. That is unfortunate.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The last time the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure held a hearing on the EPA's nominee to head the Independent Agencies Committee came earlier this year in October and December of this year. This nominee has some serious concerns as chairman of the Congressional Budget Office to deal with the impact that regulation on business will have on the President of the United States and on the American people as well as Republicans and Democrats alike who have served on the Obama administration's bureaucracy.  We have heard the nominee make some vague statements that have misled Members about his background in economics, or some of his prior experience and his experience when he was the mayor of Chicago and for a period of time with the mayor's office and during his Presidency.  No one has ever asked the nominee about his tax returns which

Mr. Speaker, this legislation simply states that the United States will consume up to 100 million barrels of oil per day to accommodate Saudi Arabia's unsustainable and irresponsible fossil energy ambitions.
