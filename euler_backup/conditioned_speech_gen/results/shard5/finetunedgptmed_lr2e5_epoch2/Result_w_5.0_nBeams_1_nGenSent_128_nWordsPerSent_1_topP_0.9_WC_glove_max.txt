Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I will be very brief because I have a very important amendment and I would be more than willing to give up a little time to go back and make sure that the votes are there. I do not think any Senator wants to see the bill go back to a conference. I think all Senators understand the way it works out here in the Senate and the kind of cooperation that can result if we can resolve this bill so that our people do not pay the taxes that are due them in 2026 and 2027. So I will spend a little less time than normal. But I am going to be brief.  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the National Research and Development and Engineering Council to strengthen the global competitiveness of American innovation. In this effort to strengthen America as a world leader in both the science and technology fields, the Council has to be a part of that success. It is not a question of how much money the council makes from the government or private industry or whatever; it is a question of how much we can increase our competitiveness and exports to the rest of the world. As long as the United States is going to lead the way in the global economy and be the global leader in science and technology, it is essential that we increase our

It is certainly a concern that there are very few small business start-ups in my district because I know this is true for most of our States.

Mr. President, I rise to comment about some of the other work that is going on in the Senate with regard to consumer protection and workplace issues. I wish to focus my remarks on a case before the Senate that I believe is of particularly serious concern to many of the workers who face high costs and high job losses as a result of the mounting cost of prescription drugs and for other reasons.  Last week, the National Health and Medical Services Commission in California--which is the agency responsible for planning health care reform in the United States--issued a report on the state of Medicare and its budget. The report is for general assistance purposes only. It does not

Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider a rule that limits debate on the government funding legislation for fiscal year 1996. This is a rule that I consider to be one of the most important measures this House will consider because of the urgency of providing for the safety and security of our Nation's aviation system.  Some debate has been given to whether or not the legislative term for this bill is ``programmatic''; however, I believe that this is not the case. As we debate the authorization for the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we need to know what the bill will be and will be enacted to ensure that we can protect the safety of our nation's people

Senator Russert leaves a void that most of us will never be able to fill. We will miss him as a speaker and as an inspiration and an individual.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, last week the administration spent a lot of time touting the administration's so-called smart and economic plan. The point is the administration's economic plan would not serve as a blueprint for this Nation. The American people have lost the confidence of this country because it is being run by a Democratic President and a Democratic Congress.  The American people are watching the President repeatedly vote on tax policy that he could not even implement in a Presidential election year, that he could not even call for passage. Yet the American people did not want him to implement in the name of deficit reduction this administration put forward for the American people because the Democratic majority in Congress

However, I can only conclude that the administration would be more than a little hard pressed to make a case for the need for the privatization of our prison system if they really believe that this Government is already in the business of dealing with the problems of public health, law enforcement, and the like.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 4296 and the fact that we have passed legislation which has Republican and Democratic coequal members of this body. We need to focus on real solutions instead of political games with the ability of us to have our way with people in our government. There are real reforms that need to be made if we are to have any hope of actually bringing us to a balanced budget this year without massive cuts to education and the environment or other important programs.  This bill is not the way to do that or the only way to do that. It does not affect public education education or public

For the first time in years, the full work of the Armed Services Committee and the public has been allowed to be assessed and public information has been given to the Congress in a complete, public way. President Nixon would say ``no to ``no'' no more than ``no to transparency'' when it came to the $3 billion spent to recover the Pentagon papers from their office and to keep them from being released into the public at all.

There is no hard line against these offsets in March, but there are no more of those in the reconciliation bill than there were last year. We would not be able to take those from the National Food Program unless those offsets in March were extended, and it is really no different in this bill than it was in last year's bill. The

This rule is a blatant ploy by the IRS to ban all audits, not just audits pertaining to audits conducted pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It is not intended to be comprehensive.

So the first time I was a Member of Congress in January of 2001 was because of the effort of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], the majority leader in the House of Representatives.

It has not been good for the American people because we had no fiscal responsibility for health care reform and had no revenue sources available to help this country recover from a major economic and fiscal crisis in the years before that crisis did occur because the President

Mr. Chairman, this is the same issue the administration is coming down to the House today to vote on. We want to have free and universal health insurance for everyone in the United States.

Yesterday Speaker Gingrich used his special committee to pull from the Christmas tree the 50 percent relief for the 5 million families who got health insurance in 1993, 1995 and 1996.
