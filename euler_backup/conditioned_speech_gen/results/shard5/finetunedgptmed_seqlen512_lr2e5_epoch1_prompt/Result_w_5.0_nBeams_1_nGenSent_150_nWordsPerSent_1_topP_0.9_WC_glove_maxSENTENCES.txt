Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who are speaking in favor of this amendment because it has many important issues at stake, and these are very important issues that are important to the people of our State and the people of the country that support this amendment and what it would do to maintain and enhance the defense budget of the United States.  This is an amendment that has a lot of support from the Governmental Affairs Committee, and there are a number of other committees that are interested in the matter as well, including the Committee on Agriculture, the Committee on Commerce, the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on the Appropriations, the Committee on the Transportation and Infrastructure, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Housing

But I think we could have done this in a different way. The subcommittee has made some good strides in the past few years to make sure that we as a committee did not fall back on the status quo when it comes to capital requirements in this country that we are experiencing today because of the very short time we have left before the election, and there is no reason why we should not be very careful about how we allocate our scarce capital resources.  That is why I ask the Speaker and the committee to stick to the established allocation. Again, this is on a letter-of-affirmation. The House has the authority to change the allocation of resources so

Mr. President, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program has successfully carried out activities and initiatives designed to ensure that the welfare system is more responsive to the needs of children. One of the programs that has been strengthened by this bill is the Family Support Initiative [FSI]. It is essential that the Federal Government provide sufficient funding and support to conduct field tests and evaluations to better understand how families respond to benefits. This program assists recipients to develop the appropriate response plan for responding to in-support to actions taken by Government agencies. The experience provided by the FSI will help foster new approaches that help the welfare system respond effectively to changes in family behavior.  Families will be able to focus their efforts and resources on activities that increase compliance, achieve new levels of self-sufficiency, and increase parental involvement in children's lives. Research will demonstrate

This measure is a great step in the right direction to ensure that the Federal Government takes on the necessary responsibilities to clean up and address the environmental damage that has been caused by our Nation's energy industry.  House Resolution 615 is a bipartisan compromise between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commerce Department that creates a new State Environmental Impact Statement program that will allow States to apply for Federal funds to pay for expensive environmental studies, even if the study will not be cost effective.  I am hopeful that this new, cost-effective program will bring greater consistency to the Federal Government's share of the cleanup of the Nation's wastewater infrastructure.

In this case, under the terms of the agreement with the United States, the guarantee for the initial two years is going to come to $700 million but it is to be reduced to $100 million if the net interest rate increases to 3.8 percent. It is a really great agreement and I think it is an important one.

This moment is in recognition of Marion's decades of service to the country and her dedication to the mission of the United Methodist Church in my home State of Ohio.  Marion was born in Montgomery in 1912 in Cleveland, OH, and came to Marion and Cincinnati in 1928 as part of a wave of Polish immigrants to this country. Her parents were working in a local school when she was only 2 years old. Marion made a good living as a successful labor organizer for the people she helped in her family when she was still in school. She wanted to be a model for all of us.

Immigration is the most popular issue debated in America today because it gives us the opportunity to work for the principles that make this country great.  But if we allow this Congress to overrule and expand the Immigration and Naturalization Act, this will be the most significant law enacted since the bill was enacted in 1986. If we allow the courts to make decisions about whether our immigration laws are consistent with the Constitution, it will be the most significant law in America since it required Congress to enact a balanced budget amendment in 1990 and passed by the Senate in 1991.

The fact of the matter is that the people that sent us here are the people that are going to make the decisions in the Federal Government not so much based on their own personal financial interests as they are based on what is best for our country and what is best for their own community and the health care for their family and for their property, which is what this money, the precious

The majority of the amendments of which I have in front of me in this amendment would extend the authority for the Corps to accept funds and would extend it to increase the authorization level for this program at the Department of the Army to the amount authorized by Congress and voted on last year.  Let me explain how this amendment would work. First, it would simply take the amount authorized for the authorization of this program that has been held up in conference and call it fully authorized.

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Care and Improvements Act of 2014, as reported by the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.  This bill helps States address the concerns of VA-funded home health care providers by removing health care funding from the list of approved VA home health care providers that are being investigated or tried for fraud, waste, and abuse by the Department of Justice.  The bill also provides VA inpatient care beds for home health care providers that are suitable for homeless veterans. It delays potential bed closures for existing VA facilities that have homes for homeless veterans, and provides funds to provide care at childcare facilities that do not have such facilities.  While it is important to include all of these provisions, the bill also waives the requirements for listing VA approved homeless

Mr. President, one of the many interesting challenges this Congress will face is that of cleaning up the very toxic mess that the welfare system is creating in our country. It is now becoming more and more clear that we need to find a new way to finance this administration's attacks on the working poor and for other political causes than just being concerned about people's health. We have to also take into account how our budget will be paid for if the budget is to continue to provide the type of security for the taxpayers that it does for the working poor that so many of them are now looking to this Congress for help in the years ahead. That is the next challenge and it is the one that all of us should look forward to working towards on this appropriations committee this year so that we can avoid the so-called ``Big Government budget''

Many consumers believe that there is no fraud on the Internet, that they are very careful about what they type in a computer screen or what they communicate with someone they know online. They are as careful as they can be about which Web sites they visit or which Web sites accept their payment in their e-commerce store. I believe that is all we want for you and me and our kids.

Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee for yielding me time. The amendment before us does not require any money to be expended. Instead, the legislation would increase direct spending on the Export-Import Bank to $50 million per year while further limiting the bank's borrowing authority to $40 million in fiscal year 2004 and $15 million in fiscal year 2005. That means that in order to obtain the necessary authority to approve overseas foreign operations and allow us to participate in additional lending to major U.S. companies that might create jobs or products that could be sold in our markets abroad, we are going to have to have to tighten our belts and cut back on the access to credit that other companies are making available to us.

The administration has had no interest in pursuing economic and diplomatic means to prevent Iran from continuing its nuclear activities. That means that if sanctions fail to make any headway in forcing Iran to live up to its end of the bargain, Iran can increase its military capabilities with the targeted sanctions they can count on only if they continue to continue

Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R 347 which grants emergency relief to the people of Texas who have been struggling with the damaging effects of the Superfund site cleanup.  The legislation I am supporting today authorizes $1.5 million in discretionary funding that will go to the cleanup efforts and ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes that have been made in the past. I am pleased that a compromise was reached to include only one provision in this legislation that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to make an interim analysis to determine the number and types of sites within the Superfund boundaries which would qualify for disaster relief under the Superfund program and the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA]. The emergency funds are intended to provide some measure of assistance to all affected communities, both State and local government officials and interested citizens

Mr. President, the torture debate took another deeply troubling turn yesterday. The Nation learned the troubling truth that the Bush administration was the real torturers, that they knew there was something very wrong when the President announced this morning the White House would give it a try with the President of Iraq, as well as the President of Saudi Arabia, and the Secretary of State. In fact, all the CIA agents in Congress knew of this. They were on notice.  This revelation is deeply disturbing, and I understand that many of my colleagues join me in expressing deep concern for America's ability to control foreign policy. But while we begin the process of responding to the facts about how the torture regime was utilized, it is critically important that we keep in mind two important basic facts.  First, the administration has repeatedly insisted that this does not amount to

Mr. President, America has come a long way in addressing discrimination in the workplace since the Equal Pay Act of 1963. For many years it was a legitimate question whether women who make the same salary as their male colleagues would receive the same pay raise they have now. Now the answer is clear and justifiably so. However, in one area the debate on pay fairness has not been as clear.  When the Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963 there was an outcry from the very sector of our economy which was being denied the pay raise men have today. That was the repairman sector of our economy which has long since been marginalized by the ever-present threat of outsourcing and even the threat of slowdowns in the future of the workforce if we do not restore equal pay to these men and women in this country. This is a

H.R. 2420 would create a permanent art collection at the National Museum of the American Indian.

Mr. Speaker, gas prices are at a record high, at over $3 per gallon. Yet, gas tax revenue from these high prices is not being spent to build new oil-burning electric cars for the American people to use, but instead used to finance the Clinton administration's tax-and-spend agenda.  Mr. Speaker, the New York Times reports this week that the Federal Treasury has only $65 million to spend on new fuel-saving vehicles for the American people that are more efficient than our current gas-guzzling cars. That means that because gas prices are at record highs and American taxpayers are paying record gas prices to subsidize the Clinton administration's gas tax raise, that if you have a new new gas-guzzling car in your neighborhood and it is only using 20-percent less electricity, that it can

Mr. President, my amendment just read expresses the sense of Congress that Federal agencies should do more to ensure that the health of Americans is addressed when they make a decision about how to dispose of their personal information. This amendment is long overdue in that the Federal Government is not doing what it should be doing when it comes to this issue.  Federal agencies have taken an immense amount of pressure to do more. Federal agencies have withheld important information from the public, withheld critical information that would help improve the health of the American people, denied information from the public to protect privacy, and did an alarming amount of things in the name of protecting information. This amounts to censorship, and I would suggest it is unprecedented in the history of the Federal Government.  Unfortunately, I don't think that the public understands this is happening, but it is happening

The purpose of this program is to provide an incentive for the many States that, for all practical purposes, have the authority to determine the amount of compensation that ought to be provided under the National Flood Insurance Program for their flood disaster damages and the amounts that ought to be given to the States for mitigation of those damages. However,

We have an opportunity to do that this afternoon and provide a little clarity about the Constitution and the President's authority and the need to take action to protect the rights of our hardworking citizens.

The committee bills are appropriate because they increase the total funding provided for the food stamp program by some $40 million. The increase would have affected 14 million people in the food stamp program and added $25 billion to the overall fund.

Mr. Speaker, President Trump, along with his Republican choir here in Congress, is sabotaging your healthcare bill and making it harder for people to keep their healthcare plans that they like.  The Speaker of the House said the best way to keep your plan is to change it.  These poor, needy people are going to be even more desperate if the Trump administration keeps trying to sabotage their plans for no other reason than they're too good to be true. I urge the President to abandon these efforts and allow them to be changed to do what they originally promised would be the best for all people.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I want to briefly explain for the record my votes on the nomination of Kimberly Carper as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury and on two amendments offered by Senators Bond, Kohl and Domenici. They are pro-environment, and they are pro-jobs.  On September 27, 1996, President Clinton was forced to announce the death of Labor Secretary Cooper who was killed in a plane crash. Secretary Cooper would have been the last department Secretary to be confirmed before he was eventually succeeded by Secretary Timothy Geithner. After a tumultuous confirmation process Secretary Cooper served with a sense of humor and was at once eminently successful and pleasant. Secretary Cooper quickly proved himself as one of the sharpest, most insightful policymakers the Department of Treasury has ever had. He was able to take an agency he had no experience in and turn

How is this possible? It is obviously because of a mistake which the Rules Committee made in not including it in the Senate substitute amendment. It was added to the House bill as part of the comprehensive approach in the House for the purposes of consideration of the two particular critical bills relating to health care and Social Security reform and the other three critical measures in the total comprehensive package on the floor of this House.

The CBO estimates that the fiscal year 1997 release of FEMA funds to counties and cities for storm water, storm water runoff and solid waste would result in a reduction of approximately $110 million, a decrease of $30 million below fiscal year 1996. Therefore, California would lose an additional $40 million in emergency funding.

Mr. Speaker, I stand with Democrats for the people. Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Democrats want to preserve the Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to keep it. Democrats want to improve it. Republicans want to defund it. Republicans want to end it. Democrats want to expand it. Republicans want to privatize it. Republicans want to stop it.  The Affordable Care Act provides access to essential preventive health care for American families, and it ensures a fair, affordable health care for all.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor and support H.R. 4772, a bill to honor and preserve the Chinese Government's 31,500 year old imperial palace of Xi'an. The ``Five Star Treasures of Xi'an'' are Chinese government treasures which have been in public hands since the last century. The official designation of the Xi'an Palace in 1922 changed the name to the North China Sea Palace for the Chinese people to recognize the position of Beijing as the world's economic and political center of power. The Xi'an Palace remains a model for the United States to emulate by protecting and documenting China's historic status in the international community and developing its cultural and technological resources. The ongoing negotiations between the Chinese Government and the U.S. to reunite the country to the world community is an important step in improving the relations with

Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome Gil Kerlikowske, recently confirmed as Commissioner of the United States Trade Representative. For too long, this institution has been plagued by a lack of oversight of our trading relationships around the world. When Gil came before the House of Representatives and made the decision to step down in July 2005, I was hopeful that he would at least act in a reasonable and responsible manner by promoting economic growth and opening new markets for American companies and workers. The administration had nominated a few weeks before to be U.S. Trade Representative but later withdrew his nomination as a result of disagreements over the Department of Commerce Trade Administration and human rights in China and Vietnam.  As recently as last month, the administration criticized NAFTA as a secret agreement between Mexico and the United States. I believe that trade agreements and other agreements such as the North American

Mr. Speaker, today marks the 174th anniversary of the declaration of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1821.

In addition, it is vital that we continue to strive to make sure that Greece maintains an inclusive and peaceful democracy, a cornerstone of the broader Greek community.  Mr. Speaker, Greek independence, although enduring and successful, does not prove a new beginning for Greece.

I would, however, caution Members from further reducing funding for missile defense.

A reduction of funding for the expansion of the Russians' military and for the continued development of the long-range forces of the Russians will only increase the chances that we will not be able to meet the increasing cost of defense for our Nation.

This bill includes no funding for FDA policy relating to animal drug safety or the FDA permit regulations, although the bill includes several of these specific provisions for a bill aimed at further reducing animal drug and device legislation and not to avoid the costs of this legislation for the Federal Government.  The amendment before us increases funding to the FDA by $8 million to implement and implement the recommendations of the bipartisan National Academy of Sciences

So, yes, there is a lot of complicated economic terms, statistics, and charts that we all have to work through in our own lives to understand what is going on and to place the other issues aside and move on with our lives and our families. But the President of the United States has said, no, we are going to use half the President's budget and then to the next half and half and half. I would have to say that if we go through the whole of the entire Government like this, the American people are going to wake up and they are going to see that the kind of infrastructure that we have that we have in our country is not really infrastructure at all. It is fuel production, it is oil production, it is power production, it is water production, it is a whole range of other kinds of production,

Madam President, I rise today to speak about a bill, the Railroad Competition Act of 2005, which was part of the fiscal year 2005 Rail and Transit Appropriations Act. I would like to commend Senator Landrieu and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for including an important new provision in this bill which would benefit all railroads in North America. I am also pleased that my staff has been working with Senator Reed to perfect language to make this bill even more technical than the original bill that was passed by the Senate last Congress.  While I would have liked to have had more time to work with my colleagues in this Chamber on this important bill, I do feel that the legislation before us today has the potential to create and strengthen a vibrant rail industry in my home State of Minnesota and other States in the Midwest.

I think that it is important to be heard clearly, as the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means said, that the minority has no objection to efforts to use the budget as a means to balance the budget and to give us the opportunity to approve of the budget resolution to reduce the debt and to balance the budget and to invest in the middle class and working families. So we are in that position and the majority cannot justify why we should not have the opportunity to send to the President of the United States a budget that is in balance and in part cuts the budget on the backs

Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Lewis Monroe Huddleston graduated from St. Thomas More Junior High School in 1860. While in college he was drafted into the Confederate Army. After his discharge from the Army he returned to Columbia where he graduated from St. Thomas More in 1862. In addition to his high school education, Lewis was also awarded the award for valor by King George III, a Silver Star and the Army Commendation Medal, the Overseas Service Medal, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

I ask for their help and their assistance. This administration used the military and the special operations resources of this country as they led a military operation against Iraq. We went in with absolutely zero military experience whatsoever and a very limited military ability that allowed us to surprise the Iraqis at the very last moment in order to try to protect them and to try to prevent a genocide that would have resulted if this administration had not authorized the military escalation and deployed it too quickly. They had no military experience and a very limited military capability to deal with the training of our troops that they needed for this task.

In an earlier debate I mentioned this is legislation filled with risk. We have now had 9,500 soldiers involved in operations in Iraq and we have now had 18 of our helicopters in combat. This bill does not require troops to come back to Iraq as a condition to be able to deploy. It just allows them to do that when they return from deployment. That is all it does. It does not require them to come back or to have authorization to do it. But it allows them to do it when they come back to Congress and they require Congress to approve it in order to proceed, in which case the bill would fail to meet constitutional requirements that a Congress cannot take provisions enacted by executive order without legislation.

Mr. President, today is tax day, not typically a day of celebration for anyone, with the day quickly approaching for many Americans. Tax Day is a time that many Americans have to think about how their taxes are being spent and the way they are being used. Often it is not the case that those tax dollars are being spent the right way or that they are being used the best way, so they are left wondering as to how their tax dollars are being spent. Tax Day can be a time that many Americans are particularly concerned with the fact that all of the tax systems have turned out to be the same. Many have become so used to the tax system that they do not even notice that they are getting different tax treatment than the other individuals they tax or the companies they do business with.

Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, in these hallowed Halls, we have the power to do things for the people of America by enacting legislation that impacts the safety and security of our communities and the daily lives of our citizens. The threat of terrorism may be not an issue we are currently addressing in the United States, but the homeland security threat has been greatly improved in recent years because of the protection of Americans in airports and other places that are under siege from foreign terrorists.  Our first responders are protected with comprehensive emergency response training. Public health officials are trained to care for those who suffer from illnesses related to exposure to toxic substances such as mercury and asbestos in the workplace or in homes and apartments. Fire and emergency medical services departments are well trained and are often willing to make common-sense reductions in medical care for those suffering from injuries that would

Mr. President, we want to give seniors the right to choose in as many areas as possible as they have the right to choose now and in an alternative way in which they know it is not Government mandated and is not a part of Medicare or Medicaid or a part of other programs. The plan the Senator from New Jersey has set forth is a way to do that. It is voluntary and it is a compromise and it is a kind of welfare reform that gives seniors the option of self-funding their own health care.  It is as simple as that. It says that under Medicare Part D, if you need care for a broken ankle or for an open heart operation or if you are pregnant or a young child or disabled, that you have a choice to go to another program or to go to a private plan that is not required

Mr. President, this amendment is a commonsense reform that allows the Joint Committee on Taxation to ensure the tax bill makes responsible cuts that are related to economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office recently released its findings regarding our amendment, which include the following: CBO is likely to project that the bill would reduce the deficit over the life of the bill by about $20 billion over the next decade without the legislation. CBO is estimating that the bill would actually increase spending for Social Security and Medicare by about $28 billion over the next 10 years in the period that it is in effect. This is very important to understand for what it is. We want to make sure that we are making it clear that we do not want to simply take people out of tax breaks and turn them into spending that does not support economic growth in the first place.

Under the Republicans plan to cut Social Security benefits and reduce tax rates, this is a result you cannot find in any bill that you read and see on the television or come to the Capitol Building. There will be cuts in Medicare for senior citizens and some people will lose the benefits they need for their Medicare and Medicaid. Health care for the elderly will be cut by $11 billion.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican plan actually cuts health care and taxes and Medicare for a very large number of Americans who are wealthy.

Well, if there is no plans to close offices and it would cost more to plan for an outpatient clinic, then yes, the plan would have to go down a little bit and go down in price so that the patient would be not only covered by the coverage and the outpatient clinic, but that that plan would be 100 percent cost sharing for the outpatient clinic.   Cris Collinsworth also has to say this: By not negotiating with the insurance companies, by not negotiating with the pharmaceutical companies, by not negotiating with the providers and the health care providers to find out what the cost is to them, we are potentially going to be cutting back on their market share even further, which would be very detrimental to them. And that is a very short term solution. It will cost a lot of jobs in the long term.

I will explain to the Senator the problem I find with her amendment. I think she should be careful and she should understand the amendment as it is drafted and it may be not well understood by the Senate and the other body.  As to the effect it may have on the District of Columbia, this amendment would prohibit the sale of Federal lands in the District of Columbia for 5 years without State authorization. The District of Columbia is the only territory that has not received a State authorization for 5 years and has nothing to do with the one that Congress wrote into law.  The Constitution says that the Senate shall have the power to lay such an appropriation bill as shall be necessary to carry the government of the United States into execution. And section 2 of the amendment prohibits any State from exercising any such authority if such State so consents.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues tonight to debate this most important provision of the budget agreement that would ensure that our Nation does not continue the same pattern of government that it has in the past. Under the plan that I have offered today, State and local government will not be able to collect taxes on the sales of real property on which it is taxed for the Federal Government to live or to work on the local level. This important provision is the first step toward a truly fair and balanced national tax policy for the benefit of all Americans. As has been noted, this proposal ensures that States will continue to collect tax on the sale of real property for the Federal Government, and allow local governments to continue to collect taxes on the sales of real property that is for Federal use as well as for local government for Federal use as well.

For that reason, today I rise in support of the RESTORE Act, the Protect Our American Children Act, and an authorization for funding for programs that enable our law enforcement officials to keep our Nation safe. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was established as a dedicated public education and an all-volunteer agency and works day-to-day with its State partners

Mr. Chairman, I will soon offer a motion to recommit. This motion seeks to increase funding for the construction of the new Federal Prison for the Criminally Insane in a way that will enable this institution to provide services to the children and families that they represent. I would like to thank my colleague for bringing this important issue before us. In January 1995 the Congress passed an appropriation of $200 million to the Federal Prison for the Criminally Insane in hopes that increased funding would be used to place a maximum of 24 children and six families in the care of the United States after the period of their incarceration is complete. Since then the resources for the construction of this new Federal prison have been reduced from the year 2000 levels. After the Congress enacted the 1990 Omnibus Crime Control Act it is hoped that the new federal prison would again be able

The appropriators have worked on this with considerable skill and resources. The chairman of the Committee on the Budget has been a hard worker and a strong supporter of this idea.

In my own State of Massachusetts, two-thirds of the children who were out of work for more than a month in the last year received public assistance because their parents could not work because of any illness or other reason. If the American public were to continue to make more excuses for the families in Massachusetts and the United States than they do now for those children who are on welfare, it would not only be unfair but would make the case for the Federal Government to close the child care centers in our districts rather than to make the case for the child care

One-third of auto accidents occurred in rural areas, 46 percent occurred in urban areas, and 66 percent occurred in higher middle income households.

I am proud to support this important legislation because it has the strong support of the majority and minority of the House and the vast majority of Americans.  On the first of June in 1514 the House of the United States ratified the Articles of Confederation with the formal vote of a House of Representatives in the State of Pennsylvania and all the other States around the Nation. This treaty was the first time in history that the U.S. Government formally recognized the sovereignty and independence of the Cherokee and Chickasaw nations and recognized their responsibility for providing care and care of the American Indian people.  In recognition of their continuing independence, this document extended the exclusive jurisdiction of the Cherokee Nation to those parts of the country where the settlement of the nation had occurred

Mr. Speaker, some years ago in a notorious political murder case, the accused relied on the rather similar tactic that the accused in this case used that would give him not the jail time that he sought but the jail sentence that would certainly grant him the approval of the authorities to use again. Here we have an accused in this case that is found not guilty by reason of insanity and convicted by the evidence on a third-degree murder charge.  However, the fact of the matter is, what this trial has given the Federal Government is yet another opportunity to avoid the burden of proof on these two Members and to get away from the burden of proof in this particular case. We should not set this precedent by sending the bill to the President's desk without the necessary congressional legislative response to make sure that there is not a waiver of the provision of

Mr. Speaker, if any issue goes to the heart of the concept that every child deserves to be treated with respect, I cannot think of a more important issue that we should be addressing this year than the raising of our child tax credit for working American families that contribute to our economy and to our American dream. I am pleased to join the vast majority of my colleagues in opposing a proposed rewrite of our child tax credit for families earning less than $26,500 a year, but I am here today to join them to make it perfectly clear that American families do pay a fair share of taxes.  When we debate a tax cut, we must define that cut not in terms of where it will add to our deficit, but in terms of who pays. If we make a $500-per-child tax credit per child even a

We are very concerned with the fact that the President will not allow any balanced budget amendment to come before us before it expires in a few weeks.

We would suggest that we should not impose that tax in our budget if we do not believe that it is responsible spending and not imposing it on our taxpayers as they tax the earnings of Americans. So I would suggest that that is not the issue at hand, but that we should not use the tax increases that would take place by this particular provision to support that which would be the goal of tax cuts, the extension of tax cuts for those

I came here and felt so badly for some of the people in my State who are being hurt, because people believe a budget that cuts a program and cuts services goes in the wrong direction for those who need it most.

Mr. President, America's greatest asset is its people, and what makes the American population unlike any other nation in the world is the creativity and resourcefulness that has made America a superpower.  This fact makes it all the more important that we reflect upon our shared history as pioneers of industrial technology and human culture, because if this history is considered history, America is the most American of all countries.  America's success is the direct result of the ability of American workers to make products that make those products as American as the citizens of those countries themselves. These products have helped to expand the standard of living for Americans, helping Americans to become more competitive in the world marketplace and attracting more American jobs to those countries of origin.  Although the United States now accounts for almost half the world's population, American workers continue to play an increasingly important role

Mr. President, the Constitution provides the Senate with a responsibility to evaluate Presidential nominations. This is not a partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats agree that Senate action should be taken to reduce the Senate's deficit and to prevent the Senate from looking at wasteful Government spending and the abuse of power of the executive branch.  If there is one area in which this issue is not partisan, it is the matter of the role of the Judiciary Committee in reviewing executive branch judicial nominations. The Department of Justice is the executive branch's main vehicle for issuing judicial nominations, and for these important actions it is hard to believe that the Democratic Senatorial Committee would object to the Armed Services Committee holding a hearing on this matter.

I would also like to point out that it is not only being used to give tax cuts to some people but tax cuts to the rich.

President Franklin Roosevelt announced the President's plans to use his budget and proposed to create 10,000 new National Guard and Reserve units for national defense purposes in February of 1946.

Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to rise today in strong support of the Mollohan-Butterfield Community Action and Economic Development Program, which funds five community development projects in Bucks County, the southern part of Bucks County that I represent. The Bucks County Community Action and Economic Development Program works to revitalize this community by providing a vibrant downtown community, as well as supporting economic development in this area of central Bucks County through employment and business development programs and a streamlining of the County Highway System to bring more traffic to the region's small towns. In addition to funding the five community development projects in the southern part of Bucks County, the Community Action and Economic Development Program funds over 60 other local, State, and Federal initiatives in the region which help to meet the local community needs and promote economic growth.

The American people deserve better than the GOP bill which would increase taxes for over 7 million Americans and force 800,000 families into State and Federal government programs. We need to stop the negative message that is being spread on the unemployment benefits and unemployment compensation and just focus on the important job growth that we all need.

This would make it very difficult for some to suggest that we are not in need of spending cuts or that we should not address some of our more pressing problems if we did not want to pick up these extra funds we have already incurred. It could also make it very difficult to get support for those very programs that need to be eliminated if we had to choose between the needs of the families who are going to have to accept that spending cut or the needs of the Government itself.

Remembering what happened that night is an important event for us to hold and to thank the life and the life of this young girl, who we were proud to say was the first of her kind to live.  The first responders who saw her after she was in the street have said that they went right in there and they talked to her and they are concerned about her.  She is now in recovery but we all want to tell her

So for the 15 minutes I have taken to speak on the budget resolution, I thank the Chair for letting me.

The decision the administration has made on nuclear posture to this President was made without proper congressional oversight and without congressional consent under the Nuclear Posture Review Act of 2002. The Nuclear Posture Review Act was passed with bipartisan support in the Senate and the House of Representatives as part of the last Strategic Forces Reform Act, and the administration took the action because it felt it was the most responsible thing to do. But the same administration under Presidents Bush and Obama also took the decision to build the new national security infrastructure in my home State of Connecticut without adequate congressional authorization. I asked for the NPOI report, and I am not going to let this administration or their response allow this country to come to terms with this problem.

Mr. Speaker, more than half of the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans today for upper income Americans will be pushed to the lowest income taxpayers in America. In the next 12 months, these tax cuts for upper income Americans will cost the Federal Government $43 billion in the first year alone and over $4 trillion over the next 30 years. We have to spend some serious fiscal discipline right now if we want to continue the economic growth that we have had over the last 18 months and to continue to build a middle class tax base so that everybody can pay their share of the cost of government. I have been working with the Speaker of the House to find a balanced plan that will get America the tax cut that it deserves and to avoid this type of bill that is not revenue neutral.

I think there is no one better to take this responsibility than John McCain because he did it as a good Senator and then as a President.

Mr. Speaker, this is a frustrating time in Washington. For the first time in 17 years Congress may be considering a budget that will take America in the wrong direction by increasing the Federal Government's deficit by almost $1 trillion over the next 10 years. No longer will the people in this Congress continue to want to lead the way in lowering the deficit and lowering the cost of government. Rather than talking about how to bring down our deficit, the Republicans will propose to go back on their promise and enact tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the middle class.  I ask my colleagues to focus their votes on the specific changes proposed in this budget and on the Senate budget, which will raise taxes by $115 billion in a $200-per-person tax increase.

I would say to the gentleman that we are clear here on the issue of reauthorization and you can certainly talk a lot about that as the conference committee moved through the process and our first vote came in this appropriations conference on the budget, that the committee had considered the reauthorization issue and decided we should take that up to the President of the United States and not the President of the United States to continue to have a freeze or a reduction in the national debt and we would take that up through regular order as the conference moved through the process and I know that was a significant issue in the process as the President stood up at that time and asked us to support his efforts to get a balanced budget with a 7-year balance, the problem is we are not in this position now to do so and this is the reason

I also want to commend the men and women of the U.S. Army, the marines, the Coast Guard and their families who have made this country stronger than ever before. Because of their commitment to military service and their dedication to the principles of equality and justice for all men and women, they are no longer only given the dignity of serving on the front lines of defense. In particular, I would like to pay special mention to those American families who have given so much to America since the signing of the original DoD Law of 1964: The A-

Madam Speaker, last month, Republicans voted to end Medicare. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill they passed would have cut Medicare to pay for tax breaks for the very wealthy and corporate special interests while driving the costs of the bill higher for low-income seniors and for middle-class families. We are now in the fifth year of the Republican tax bill and more than half of that tax bill is going to benefit the wealthiest one percent of America who pay a higher share of taxes than their less well-off counterparts in our country. And all we have done is drop the middle-class out of the picture so that they have a much easier time paying the tax bill.  That is not a great deal of government. It is a far cry from what Congress should be doing for working families and people in rural areas like mine

So I will not say anything to the effect that I did not hear it in the past and was not part of it at the time and hope it does not matter to the Senator from West Virginia or the Senator from New Mexico in this instance in that regard.

Over 700 people lost their lives that winter. The great sense of doom was felt throughout our country that winter storms, heavy snowstorms, and storm surges were beginning to be avoided by so many Americans. These storms were particularly devastating in our States. As the snowstorm began to move inland in Georgia, a natural storm that ravaged the South and Midwest, the rivers in our State were so swollen that they swept across the flooding in the towns that have the highest population densities in the Nation.

There's no more important agenda item currently facing Congress than ensuring America pays its bills. Unfortunately, the Democratic plan fails to address that challenge. For instance, our budget, while calling for modest spending cuts over the next 10 years, actually leaves $60 billion in the budget hole. It is a proposal that is even worse for future generations, just because of the lack of vision and commitment to making our Government work for all Americans.  The policies we are currently considering are aimed at putting money back into the pockets of those in this country who have the most to lose because of our deficits and our out-of-control debt. While our proposal attempts to meet these challenges through reforms, there is not a single piece of legislation that is introduced that will bring about the simple change of our approach to deficit reduction that is needed and that

Employees could decide to forego a salary increase and accept lower pay in order to continue the same work they have always done for the company over the years with no hope of increasing their work hours or salary in order to receive these terms of service for the next year. Would that not be a very useful step in workers seeking to work more for a better paying job or the services they are provided to the company? This is not the kind of compromise that a company should take because it will ensure that its workers do not have the right to choose an employer that best meets their needs and that they receive the jobs they deserve. The Federal Government should not try to give these employees the best chance they can for the future by demanding they continue to work for the same employer for the next year.

That would be likely to put us into a situation where we would not be able to defend our own Navy with these new, rather small, carriers that are proposed by this legislation.

During the same fiscal year, they made additional and better use of the funds by ensuring that funds for installation of 9 AEGIS interceptor missiles in 1991 did not lapse in fiscal year 1996 and for other such items did not lapse in the years that follow. In total the Committee on National Security made $52 million for the Long Term Storage for Weapons in Fiscal Year 1995. This total represents a reduction of only 3 percent from the same year in 1994.  The Comptroller General of the United States has advised the House that this level of funding may well be insufficient to keep the second largest export market in the world healthy. But the Committee on National Security

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased that the bill before the House today makes important changes to the specific provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1995.  I would first like to thank the subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Stark) and the ranking minority member, the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney), for their work on this bill and for their willingness to cooperate in the coming months and years to get this bill passed. I would also like to recognize and thank the staff of the subcommittee and subcommittee staff. All of them contributed to the health and well being of this bill. I believe that it is for their assistance that I was able to be able to make a number of other changes that have been identified in this bill that would improve the bill

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the subcommittee chairmen, my ranking member and the full committee ranking member for their hard work on this bill and for working with me and the ranking member on a number of other issues regarding the Human Centering Program in the Department of Education.  The Human Centering Program was established to ensure that student-athletes are well-equipped to compete in athletic activities without the need for unnecessary costly and potentially detrimental devices or equipment that could prevent athletic participation for all individuals of all ages. There is no more pressing need for the Human Centering Program than the continuing need for sports activities to be held free of any devices or equipment that may impede or interrupt the participants or prevent them from completing their game-day goals and responsibilities.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. And just to be clear, it is not to repeal the law. There are an awful lot of people that voted for the bill that repealed the law in that Senate bill. But the issue here is how many people who will go into Medicaid will be taken care of by this bill.  Now the Republican proposal is to say that every poor child in America that gets an annual voucher will get that money automatically to spend as they see fit in their Medicaid program, and there are a lot of States and a lot of local governments who will help pay for the provisions of this bill that help them provide that program to the children of the poor. So it will not in any way take care of all the children in the country.  It is just another proposal that would put more

Mr. President, I have the great pleasure today to honor John Broughton and Monty Blizard, who were recently awarded the World Professional Sports Hall of Fame award in its sixth season. The honor of the St. Louis area with such outstanding sportsmen and women are truly a tribute to the legacy of a small group of sportsmen and women from the St. Louis area and across the country who have put in countless hours of hard work and who have taken pride in the fact that they have been able to share their heritage with those who may not have ever experienced the positive influence of the sport they are involved in.  I have known John and Monty for many years and have never seen them put in such a long period of time, since they were both very young in their early years playing professional sports and continued in that tradition to play well into

Madam Chair, as we prepare to take up an important piece of legislation today, H.R. 6, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, I am pleased to introduce legislation to increase funding for the National Guard and Reserve to make our military operations more efficient and successful. We have an obligation to our men and women in uniform to protect this country at all times and today, that obligation is being demonstrated every single day in the way they serve us in our communities and their communities across the country.  As I have stated, over 40 percent of the manpower and equipment deployed for Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom comes from the National Guard and the Reserves. These resources are important to the operations of our Armed Forces and to keeping our country safe and making sure that our country is secure from threats in all parts of the world.

I was in the State legislature when we had the veto override of very great people, very courageous people on the other side of the aisle.

He has been an architect and the Senate has produced a great United States Department of Agriculture Secretary. In his few remarks on the United States Senate, I would just like to add that Secretary Overmeyer has been an honorary chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture and the Senate Committee on Agriculture has produced a great United States Department of Agriculture Secretary.

Also, I must say it is regrettable that the objection was heard on the earlier vote on the McCain amendment and the reason for that was because it was not the legislation that was at hand in that body that the Senator spoke of before the vote on the resolution. In fact, what happened was we would be here in the evening having taken up the bill and had already completed the work that was done on it when the Senator from Arizona simply said it should not be in the resolution of the Senate. What should have been in that bill had the vote been coming on it at that time.

Mr. Speaker, I have enormous respect for the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and for his work on the Labor Committee. But if I may rise in support of his earlier amendment to the rule on trade and export promotion agreements that would increase exports by $41 million. I would like to suggest to the gentleman that I can see how $40 million in additional exports can be achieved by increasing exports under the Doha Statement to our trading partners. For that $40 million to increase exports from $41 million under the existing House bill would still leave us with $51 million worth of trade deficit reduction provided $40 million were allocated to these two agreements, and $51 million worth of additional trade deficit reduction would be provided under the Doha Statement to our trading partners to account for these other possibilities under this significant increase in trade with our trading partners
