Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have expressed concern that the conference report to the budget resolution before us today is not balanced in the way that the Senate has previously approved budget legislation and which will require further action to restore the budget to a more responsible level of government spending. To this end, I hope the conference report before us today will give the House of Representatives the confidence to undertake the necessary adjustments to its budget to account for the statistics and the policies that have driven our national debt to a staggering level of over $17.8 trillion--$4.8 trillion in the last quarter of this fiscal year alone. I am extremely concerned that the conference report before us is not in balance with respect to the stated intentions of the negotiators on both sides of the aisle to balance the budget.

We can do it. And I hope that everyone will stand with our President who believes we must do the right thing. We believe in full and complete funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program for all Americans, not just children in poverty but adults who are trying to put food on the table or pay their mortgages. We believe we should take steps to make sure that poor families have access to insurance that will make their poorest possible lives possible because we do not want to take away anyone's job because they cannot afford it if they get sick or if they are able to get to work but they do not agree with the decision on insurance they have to make.  We need to continue to make the difficult choices we are making to rebuild the trust of the American people in this Nation in the kinds of things they have had to deal with

This bill would make drastic changes to our immigration laws that would change the face of immigration law and legislation in our Nation. This would harm those who bring the best of American culture to our country.  The Senator from Washington is correct. Immigration laws should be reformed to allow people who want to come to America to do so. However, it is immoral that we have one-way doors that admit nearly 5 million people per year, to never see them again, yet do nothing to restrict their access to a visa based on the risks and potential threats they face.

I think it is important to point out to my colleagues that I have raised a number of Pennsylvania issues and I do not think that any of them are unique to the Foreign Relations Committee. I have raised these issues in the Senate as well and I have raised them here on the floor of the Senate.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

You know, I agree with almost everything Congressman Burgess said, except for one thing, in terms of this health care conference report. I do not think we should even put it up for a vote until we have that legislation to look at, because to do that we would only allow us to use money that is already there on the spending side, which we can't borrow money from China because we're not going to get the money out there. We would basically be begging the Chinese to spend money to import it out of China because we have no control on the spending side of the equation. We could do that with this language that we're using today, but we don't have to go into that.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I think it is very important for Congress to be doing something to reduce the budget deficit and I know the majority has done very well with that in the last couple of years in trying to work with some of the concerns we have had, as the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Frank, and others, the amendment of the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Levin, in attempting to reduce the deficit.  But I think it is also important for Congress to be taking some responsibility and some responsibility for real savings in the overall budget. And the reason that I am for the amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts is because, as the bill before us today, would add $87.6 billion to the deficit, and in effect this amendment,

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Health Care Act. This amendment would improve the treatment of delays in health care related to the Department of Veterans Affairs compensation claims.  This legislation would direct the VA to conduct an audit to determine whether the Department was in compliance with the Federal Information Security Report standards to identify patterns of fraud and mismanagement at the VA. According to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, VA medical providers admitted fraudulent claims in excess of $1.8 billion nationwide from fiscal year 2007 childcare claims. It has been documented that over the past 3 years, the VA has admitted $87.2 million in fraudulent claims.  Approximately one-quarter of all VA medical providers refused to complete their investigations. This is unacceptable and requires action. This amendment would require that VA conduct

Mr. President, one of the many interesting challenges this Congress will face is that of both economic recovery and fiscal policy. Last Congress we made considerable progress in moving forward on policies to create jobs and finance capital investments to support economic growth. I have been encouraged that Congress is now taking up legislation to enact a $25 billion Federal spending package for the next year which we hoped would put Congress on the committees to bring our Nation's fiscal policies in the right direction.  Now we face a dilemma with regard to economic policy. The budget resolution passed last year included $5.1 trillion in tax cuts and $1.7 trillion in entitlement increases over the next 7 years, totaling $17 trillion. However, a careful analysis of the facts and with the understanding that tax cuts are great, entitlement increases are an additional stimulus. However, our

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5126, the ``Truth in Caller ID Act.'' We all know that there are many problems that consumers are having with this information system, including false Caller ID verification and misinformed consumers who are trying to uncover information they should not have. Truth in Caller ID helps consumers understand what is really going on with their information and therefore make better consumer decisions. While there is no dollar cost associated with this bill, we must all continue to demand that the Commerce Committee study this important issue.  Currently, the Caller ID verification system makes it very difficult for consumers to be able to verify that their call is being processed by the call provider. We have seen many instances where this has been difficult to learn that it is used for fraud to get around their opt-in or opt-out of Caller ID.  The

Mr. Speaker, the Governor of my home State of California has called for the Federal Government to take action to solve the California drought because she says it is bad for the State and bad for her business community. This issue is also facing a real problem in my home State of Florida, so we want to hear from my colleagues and all those concerned about how the Federal Government can do something about it so that we are not worse off.  Mr. Speaker, we are here today because the Federal Government is acting as one of the world's largest polluters, contributing nearly 2 percent of our gross domestic product. California, on the other hand, ranks second in water consumption. We are trying to address that issue in the Florida Drought Action Plan, a partnership between the Governor's office and the California Department of Water Resources that is jointly

I appreciate the ranking member's cooperation in that. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Beilenson amendment, which will allow Federal dollars to be used in China to establish the Central Committee of the so-called People's Republic of China.  Chairman Frelinghuysen and I have often argued that this legislation increases transparency in China and will be beneficial to America if implemented properly. We believe it would be beneficial if these specific instances occur for every single loan and payment the United States receives from China to assist American economic development efforts.  For example, if we were to design a Beijing water project, it might be convenient for us to try to establish a Chinese delegation of this type. But with the vast majority of the water supplies in China only being used for irrigation and municipal purposes, the China Democracy and Reform Act is a

President Clinton has defended the policy by claiming that Congress enacted such an authorization over his objections, but since that time the troubling evidence of the Bush administration's lack of candor with respect to how they conducted interrogations and detentions has emerged.  Over the past couple of months, we have heard an awful lot of, ``Oh, not the President,'' and ``That is not the practice. This is not the practice.'' We have heard, ``Oh, not us.''

Mr. President, America has come a long way in addressing discrimination in the workplace since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law.  But today the next step toward ending discrimination in the workplace is necessary to help restore the integrity of the workplace. There is no question that some Americans are hardworking and have not made a living from their time in the Nation's Capital and the rest of the Nation because they have been denied equal pay for equal work because of rulemaking of the Equal Pay Act by the Federal Government and the Supreme Court in the 1970s and 1980s when the fight was particularly on the part of Irish-Americans and other groups which they considered illegal.  These stories are common and seem to be accepted and tolerated by the general population because they were common. They are not, however, accepted and tolerated by employees

And I was stricken by some of the rhetoric that we are trying to use the Federal Government to provide some sort of a way out of our own government to find a way to pay for the Federal Government, but the Federal Government should be run by elected representatives of the people of the State of Washington and the administration of that will be the only way to do that, not to mention the amount of money that the American people are paying in their honor when they have to be denied the people's right of representation in the House.  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Bliley and Mr. Barton, for a very important piece of legislation that is necessary to honor the commitments we made to the people of the State of Washington and

Mr. President, just moments ago I left a reception for a friend, David Brody. I was invited to come to his home in Bremerton. The homecoming he attended for his retirement will be a permanent home for me and my wife for the next 20 years because we will be married in the birthday party to our daughter and son.  Today, that resolution to establish an ocean science center at Washington State's Chouteau Mine provided a very special opportunity for me to see firsthand the commitment, commitment, and aptitude of the people from the Puget Sound region to conserve the great resources of Puget Sound, the resources of the coast, and the resources of our great Nation.  I would like to read the resolution itself, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

I urge my colleagues to read this article from the Washington Post today as well as Speaker Pelosi's e-mail to American taxpayers.  While President Clinton is likely to veto a long-term overhaul of the State Department, the estimates from the independent inspector general of the State Department released today indicate that the administration is spending $2.1 billion over 5 years on implementing many of the President's proposals in a process initiated last year when he was still at the White House.

Brown as a United States District Judge for the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in the First Circuit. The majority leader's Republican colleagues are making an effort to ram through a Cabinet nomination with the potential to open up a massive Federal bench to a flood of litigation that will slow the vital reform and pro-consumer initiatives Emerson Air Force Base and other bases across the United States.  While I fully support the majority leader's efforts to move forward with these nominations, I believe the President's nominees to fill vacancies on the Ninth Circuit and the District of Columbia Courts should also receive swift consideration by the Senate.

Mr. Speaker, President Trump, along with his Republican choir here in Congress, is sabotaging your efforts to get health care reform done for America's citizens.  Speaker Ryan, your health care health care bill was riddled with lawsuits, abuses of healthcare providers, and it did not expand coverage to 10 million people. So, instead of having a bipartisan bill to bring us health care reform, we have these radical bills.  Think about that. We don't even have a bill that moves this body forward to improve health care for Americans.  Mr. Speaker, this is not the American way. We didn't play by the rules when you put Republicans in control of the House of Representatives to do things like this. It is time to get things done.

The largest program in the bill and the one where veterans would have the most direct impact would be the Veterans Education programs within the Department of Education. The States would then have the bases to decide how best to structure education for them.  A recent study by the Department of Education shows that the American public wants $900 million more education funding for veterans' programs in fiscal year 1997.

The area is very tropical and is home to some of the most beautiful and most spectacular places in the world. In the afternoon of the weekend there were three magnificent groups of white guards that came to Miami Beach and they welcomed the people of the city and the people of the United States of America to the United States of America in Convention Hall. I was there in the evening and I felt very proud to stand among them, to meet with them and to have them welcome me back to this great country that I love.

Mr. Speaker, I am confident that even with the steadfast mayneience of the U.S. Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court will repeal and replace it. This will allow for a bipartisan solution that protects access to the best healthcare available to the most vulnerable citizens in our country.

Mr. Speaker, today marks the 174th anniversary of the declaration of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire. Greek Americans from all walks of life have shaped history, and it is fitting that today marks the occasion that they have chosen to commemorate the end of the brutal and long and complex history of the Spanish culture that made this a country that so many took pride in.  On April 22, 1912, Greek patriots took up arms and committed themselves to the defense of their country in what became known as the Athens Rising. What became known as the Crisis of 1912-1913 saw the very foundation of the American empire fall, and the final days of Greek civilization witnessed a wave of immigration. By the end of 1915, over one million Greek-Americans had fled the empire, making it the largest Asian American community in the world.  While

This legislation would help make our Government work better.  Last November, in his State of the Union Address, President Bush outlined an energy plan which would generate over $1.5 trillion in net new tax revenue over the next decade. Senator Kyl's plan would provide nearly $11 billion more for domestic energy production. We can do better, and our proposal could help.  My legislation would establish a so-called mandatory energy tax credit for new domestic energy production.

Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my remarks. I rise to oppose the amendment because it would have the unintended effect of denying tax benefits to thousands of U.S.- flood insurance companies and preventing them from enforcing a statute that allows flood insurance to cover payments and insurance taxes already paid.  The amendment would increase flood insurance premiums by over $100 million for hurricane Katrina and would reduce tax credits for this program by $1 billion over the next 5 years by allowing the administration to impose regulations that would restrict tax incentives for flood insurance companies to protect property rights and protect legislation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

So, yes, there is a lot of complicated economic terms, statistics, and charts that we have used in this debate about how we do things in government and how we do things in people's homes and families' lives and on the internet in this country. But in many ways it is about much more than that. There is no doubt in our minds that President Trump was just doing what he had to do. For the President of the United States to have this to show on television as to how the production of these babies is costing the American people over $1,200 a day is so far beyond all our sense of decency and right as a human being to do that, it doesn't make any sense at all.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If you look at the stimulus plan there is $70 billion over 7 years that will help these areas economically recover from layoffs caused by foreclosure, from job losses, and it is absolutely a win-win, win-win situation for all parties involved.

Mr. President, in May, after weeks of Democratic efforts, Congress extended unemployment benefits for the last time in almost 40 years. It extended it for another year for the third time in nearly half a century. We had passed it just in time to gain our unprecedented economy momentum over the last recession. Unemployment is now falling rapidly-- durbin for the short term, but only to 1 year before it's expected to drop further into recession and downturn, it looks like.  We've been well on our way to maintaining this momentum. The last two bills that we passed under these circumstances have left the economy stronger than it is today, as opposed to a longer-term downturn that could have put the economy in jeopardy. The jobs report today is even stronger than the last three were.  As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I was struck by

The tax relief provisions in the bill are largely pro-growth in nature, and for the first time the tax provisions are working to provide for increased economic growth and stability in this country and across this world. The oil and gas drilling tax relief is also good for America. This legislation provides drilling offshore for drilling offshore.

Thank you. Mr. Chairman, contrary to what Republicans have said on the floor, the Republican budget that Chairman Kennedy and I are offering today does not take Medicare seriously and takes care of seniors and Medicaid more in Medicare and Medicaid than any of the alternatives that will be offered. As the cost of nursing homes becomes more and more out of reach, as drug prices go up, as older Americans are unable to afford the care that is necessary to live, they simply cannot afford these costs. So while the Affordable Care Act, while it certainly included some provisions that provided critical help for people with health care needs, and helped many people with chronic illness, what we see now is they have nowhere to turn for help.

Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor because of two court decisions that will have, to some people, drastic consequences for not only our families and children but our country as a whole and will have serious and lasting consequences for the safety of every man and woman who walks among us and who takes young people who are in our schools and takes them out to the mall. Judge Priscilla Owen held that the Congress and the Government could appropriate and impose guidelines on the private sector. In that ruling she said ``they cannot tell the State agency which schools should be equipped for the very young children, which should be equipped for the very old, and which can afford it or not afford it.''  Congress should stand behind her. I support a balanced budget, the same way I support sensible and realistic spending limits. That is my position, and

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the legacy of Tom Weisner, the mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. Mayor Tom Weisner was born in 1924 in Buffalo Grove Illinois. He attended suburban New York City and was elected to serve the University of Illinois in 1964. The family moved to Cincinnati in 1967 and soon established a solid foundation for civic leadership. In 1971, the Wegmans renamed Aurora's northern gateway area ``Tom's Place.''  Under Mayor Weisner's leadership, the city reached its landmark 250th anniversary. I had the privilege of joining Mayor Weisner as one of the first city councilwomen in Cincinnati's history. It was through his leadership, I became a city councilman in 1982, and from 1993 to 2006 I served as mayor.  In 2006, Mayor Weisner served again as a member of the Ohio House

As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment and the lead sponsor on the second of the three drug court funds in this year before September 30, 1996, I was very concerned about the number of people without access to drug courts that were operating in my home State of Oregon and in other parts of this country.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which is a necessary and important amendment to ensure that the Defense of Marriage Act is not waived by the bill before us. I appreciate the support of my colleagues on the Committee on the Judiciary for working with us to include the amendment in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs bill.  Mr. Chairman, in 1990 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an individual's state of marriage, was a matter of constitutional law and that, thus, marriage was between a man and a woman. The legal principle that marriage is a union between a man and a woman which is recognized as equal to that of a man and a woman applied to United States citizens as well as to citizens of any other country, not just the United States

Mr. Speaker, 42,000 Americans were killed in automobile accidents in 1995 and 1996, an increase of nearly a quarter over 1995 and over the 1994 fatalities due to highway accidents.  The Senate adopted a bill that would reduce road fatalities by half by the year 2000, the equivalent of a half-million fewer Americans going to the emergency room for preventable health problems and 50,000 fewer heart attacks and more than 100,000 fewer more asthma attacks a year and 665 new preventable and preventable Speaker-sponsored illnesses.  Now, this is a little ironic. When we adopted the legislation, there were very little who opposed it--the manufacturers, the insurers, and the insurance companies--there were very few--doctors, nurses, and hospital officials, but in October 1993, where we passed the bill, there were perhaps 30 people

Mr. Speaker, if any issue goes to the heart of the concept that every child deserves an American dream, it is the child tax credit. It has been part of our American Dream since day one. It has been an incredible success. Since we began with it in 1975, it has brought in more than $42 billion in tax revenue. But the deficit, Mr. Speaker, was cut by nearly half by 1985. It saved many middle-class families from having to lose jobs because of increased prices, from the loss of purchasing power that they now enjoy.  When we extend the tax credit that is extended today to 1996, not the new 1993 or 1996, but it is a chance for our children to have at least, the same opportunity that we enjoyed in the real economy, we have brought in $176 billion in tax

Mr. President, I will be very brief. This is fulfilling a campaign promise of Barack Obama to end wasteful spending in Washington. I am so proud that this legislation has been brought to the floor and it has already passed the House of Representatives and the Senate by a similar large margin. This is a program that will save taxpayers $13 billion a year and eliminate wasteful spending--$13 billion in the first year alone, and $43 billion in the years beyond. So there are a lot of wasteful spending programs. It costs unnecessarily wasteful taxpayer dollars to duplicate, and as a result, we waste. So when the Government reallocates, I think we will learn to work better with one another to reduce those wasteful programs and, most importantly, get our fiscal house in order.  It will take about 10 years to complete this process.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my support for H.R. 3887, the William Wilberforce Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2005, introduced by my good friend from California (Mr. Cardoza). This bill has been referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce for their consideration and consideration of the bill in this department will bring about greater funding for the educational programs provided to all of our students in public schools and support of their parents' ability to educate their children in this manner and all our other students in this way as well. Our Congress and this administration express this intention through this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to express my appreciation for the hard work that the sponsor, Congressman Weldon from California, has done and that of his fellow co-sponsors, Congressman Honda and Congressman Price.

Madam President, I enjoyed listening to the Senator from Rhode Island, as I always do. He is always giving some great history lesson and some fine education about the history of this country, because he does believe it is true that Republicans and Democrats in this body were at the same time asking for taxes to pay for education programs. That is not a bad idea in many ways. There is also a concern about health care for young people, the fact that if they are exposed to those issues over the next few years, that they may develop these problems.  I always do look forward to listening to what the Senator has to say about these issues and his experience in being there.

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama, for the wisdom he has offered on the question of whether this proposal should be adopted. I think it is an important debate for Illinois because it will make a difference in the State of Illinois as it relates to this program.  The Senator from Illinois has noted that this program as written today will not allow the State of Illinois the flexibility that the Governor of Illinois has proposed in his speech in support of this budget. He has stated, and the Governor has stated, that this program would be guaranteed to fund the requirements and the studies. My thought is that the language in the amendment that is included in this bill would suggest that this program does not go into the study and the deliberations. This language suggests that we should not know whether it is going to become mandatory or not, but

Mr. President, America's greatest asset is its people, and what makes the American population unlike any other Nation in the world is its diversity. This diversity is the product of people and culture, of religion and belief. It is the essence of the American people and what make America such a special place in the world. America's diversity is perhaps its most important attribute. Hispanic Americans and Latino Americans are the lifeblood of America. Not long ago, all of New York City was Hispanic. Today, New York City is home to two-thirds of all Hispanic immigrants, including 3 percent of the population of New York City.  When I was Governor, the number of persons from Latin American descent in the State of New York quadrupled, from approximately 180,000 people in 1948 to almost 215,000 people in 1972.

Mr. President, I will make some comments in morning business. First of all, I had the pleasure of speaking to the Senators from Ohio and Texas, and I think it is important that we hear from them on this issue as we consider the situation that we are now in. They have come to my desk because I am sure they have heard the discussion I just heard from my friends from Virginia and the need to give them my full attention to listen to what the distinguished Senator from Arizona says in this area. I think the Senator from Arizona has done a great service in trying to convey the understanding and help out my friends and others.  The main message that my colleagues need to hear as they vote to move this legislation forward is that the President does not need congressional approval, that they can do their own thing, not depend on the Senate.

After earning an education in the United States Government and getting married to my good friend and fellow New York City resident Will Goodall in the year 2000 to pay off some of the money my family had recently taken in from stock market profits and take care of my two great children with rising health problems, she retired to serve as an air traffic controller in Houston, Texas, and then in 1997, after 3 years of dedicated and qualified service to her country, I would consider her a hero, a man to whom I came in 1982 when I was still only a freshman in this House.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask whether Congress can raise itself to the standard of the American people and not be ashamed of its actions today.  According to the Washington Post this morning and what others have stated today in our Standard and Poor's ratings agency press releases this morning, Congress is failing to meet its fiscal obligations and revenue needs by a budget that is increasing in cuts. The Congressional Budget Office is holding Congress accountable, setting standards by which it must maintain that these cuts are reasonable.  Our budget could actually be a lot worse if not for the commitment of the President of the United States to bring our Nation's borrowing under control. After all, spending is not a zero sum game, and it certainly is not going to be a one for one game either.  I am concerned that instead of voting to increase the federal

It is an amendment that would not only help American cities to continue to produce energy for the next 10 years but it would also increase activity in our State parks to facilitate the tax revenues from tourists.

That bill helped the Government of New Jersey to develop facilities to allow us to spend money more than $30 million dollars to $60 million dollars annually dollars in dollars spent billion dollars.  It has been estimated that the cities of New Jersey have spent nearly $1 billion on bicycle facilities.

Mr. President, much ink has been spilled the past few years over the threat of nuclear war and the fact that nations are now the world's largest consumers of nuclear energy. While a comprehensive study is not yet complete on this subject, the clear link is that Iran is the world leader in nuclear technology and requires the world to act now if it wishes to remain a nuclear power for another decade. I would like to highlight some of the threats that we face as a nation as they relate to enforcement of our treaty obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1977, and the Department of Justice in their Inspector General report on the Iranian arms transfer provisions.  Iran's illegal nuclear program poses a grave threat to peace and stability and to the security of our country and other countries around the world. Its nuclear program poses a threat to peace

Madam President, I was, unfortunately, engaged in a briefing in S. 407 on the most recent budget numbers from the Governmental Affairs Committee that I had been working on for the last several weeks since the Intelligence Committee had approved that budget resolution and defense authorization request for fiscal year 1997. The release of that budget resolution indicated that the administration's budget would be a clear cut down the middle to the President and the Defense Department in their efforts to force troops out of Iraq. As such, it was my position that the passage of that resolution should set off an alarm that those benchmarks of fiscal restraint and a dollar guarantee of real and perfecting intelligence collection under the very budget resolution that would authorize those resources should in fact fail.  I recognize that these budget ceilings were based on an existing law, the Armed Services authorization bill of 1996. It was not

Mr. President, since 1994, the U.S. Government has provided tactical aerial intelligence assistance to the People's Liberation Army of China in one of the most fundamental military priorities of that Government: China is China and its military policy should not be meddled with in the way the People's Liberation Army is the People's Army of China. Indeed, when the U.S.-China Agreement on Military Cooperation was signed back in 1994, the Drug Policy Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which I have been chairing now for more than 6 years, voted unanimously in favor of that agreement.  Unfortunately, the administration has been unable to give China adequate notice of this critical international national security consideration.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 3415, the temporary gas tax repeal, election year `` programs.'' If enacted into law this year, gas taxes would increase or expire and the retail prices of gasoline would fall. At a time of record debt, this bill would harm all consumers and, as a result, would increase prices for almost all Americans. As compared to cents on the gallon in the last election cycle, when gas prices were at a six-year high of nearly $4 per gallon, and the price of gasoline, heating oil and natural gas had risen, the price of gasoline has fallen from its peak of almost $1 per gallon to $1.42 per gallon today.  For example, the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded, $3.03 in 1980, has dropped from $3.16 in

If the gentleman would yield, the death tax that he referred to is even important to the State of New Jersey because it reduces the total amount that we would be able to collect under the current estate tax law. The total amount that the total estate tax would yield to the States would be less than the $2 billion that it would yield in the next 7 years that is under the current estate tax law that New Jersey would be using under the development of the new tax plan.  That means that New Jersey would collect $2 billion less on their tax burden under this plan than they would under agriculture, $2 billion less under timber, and less under tourism, whatever the tax product might be, whether it be forest products or tourism.

This legislation reauthorizes the House of Representatives and the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary with the same powers and responsibility that they have traditionally had under the House of Representatives and the American people. It provides congressional oversight over the administration of the Federal courts, and Congress has the final say over investigations and hearings. As one who has spent 27 years in the Congress, I believe that this is the right way to go.

Mr. Speaker, that seems to be the case. A lot of people are very uncomfortable with this bill because we have a good but simple idea of the case that the House Republicans and the majority of this House should not be at a cost to themselves in terms of the constitutional rights of the American people if and when they do not vote on an appropriations bill that has support from this House and minority leadership in the Democratic Party in that Democratic Party controlled capitalist majority party of this House, the one that governs. We have had real compromise, I might add, on appropriations in this Congress. I think I know what that means. When we, on our side of the aisle, have got a situation where we have been protected from a benefit, even in terms of a cost to this taxpayer, what we see, all of the American people see

I agree with my colleagues. These efforts are important as we expect a future of supply and demand to make significant changes to the global energy environment. We have to take advantage of this opportunity to meet the needs of the world and reduce our dependency on foreign energy sources. This includes significant attention to reducing our dependence on energy imports and moving away from the current energy policy of promoting domestic consumption as well as increased attention on balanced energy utilization.  I am also extremely concerned that the Trade Promotion Authority will have implications for our relations with China, due to the increasing relationship between our two nations.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

In other words, as Speaker Gingrich and his allies in the House Ways and Means Committee have stated, this bill would default on the Nation's long-term fiscal obligations.  The same group of Republicans who voted to eliminate Medicare, as part of a broader effort to privatize Social Security, warned last month: ``Too many seniors know they do not have a way out, in a different program or on a different payment plan.''

Mr. President, I rise today to support the Dodd-DeWine amendment increasing funding for firefighter grants. Funding for firefighter grants has the strong support of several organizations in California and throughout the country.  In June of this year, the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Emergency Services' (MDPSEC) COPS-FUTURE program was authorized by Congress to support fire agencies seeking to increase fire prevention efforts. With this additional funding, the State's only firefighter grant program, providing grants to entities that train firefighters, will be expanded by more than 30 percent, going to more than 3,000 jurisdictions across Maryland and surrounding States.  We are fortunate to have these local initiatives working to improve the lives of Marylanders and to save lives. With the provisions of this amendment, we provide State and local authorities with the tools they need to step up in

The primary reason we are here today is because of the information that was issued earlier this week by the bipartisan Governmental Affairs Committee in its Special Report on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction. That Special Report, entitled ``National Defense,'' was a comprehensive look at why Congress can't fund the military at current levels. This report made clear that the current funding level is too

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill H.R. 2589, the ``Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995.'' This bill will give Congress time to work out problems with copyright term extension legislation.  The Copyright Term Extension Act was, therefore, a carefully constructed piece of legislation. The bill lengthens the life of copyrights by 5 years and the life of the temporary market monopoly system by 8 years.  I strongly support the provisions in the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995. These provisions will make it possible for the vast majority of music, sound recordings, and computer software to remain exempt from compulsory licensing, even though they are subjected to a combination of restrictive laws.  Music, I believe, deserves the least amount of protection and the least amount of public scrutiny. This bill protects millions of people in the United States from being denied their right

I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the Smith amendment in the Record at this point in the statement of the bill.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. injustice, put law on the books, a good one at that, in the District of Columbia case. And Fred Smith, who was the clerk of the district court.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Also, I must say it is regrettable that the objection was heard on the earlier proposal of the majority leader and the amendment was not allowed to proceed because the amendment of the other side was the only one that had not been allowed to be considered in this resolution at the present time. So the rule of order was followed that the last one was not allowed to be made in order but this one has been since people began the protest and now we want to set it aside for the day so people will have time to read this and it may even last for a few days in the year 2002.

Mr. Speaker, I have enormous respect for the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and for what he has done for this great country, but I would ask this country to look over their shoulders if we ever get to the White House because they need to understand that we have some $700 billion worth of dollars of deficits that we are going to have in this Nation and they are going to have huge problems if we do not solve it now. We need to find some huge amount of money that has enormous human beings and huge tax problems that we can take care of ourselves if we just go through the normal processes that we have that we have embryonic stem cell research, not use it in a sense and then be very reluctant to say, no, we want to find that out because they are not going to do that for us.
