spending spent deficits 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those of my distinguished colleagues who have spoken in favor of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Many Americans have said over and over that they think Congress needs to do more than work out a budget deficit. Well, the Senator from New Mexico and I are here in support of the budget deficit reduction bill because it is the only bill before us that increases spending for defense and domestic spending. We need to spend more money for defense and domestic spending to be more capable and able to spend more money for programs for our military and for programs for homeland security than spent to date in the budget. But just as the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out, we are also offering a strong amendment because we are offering an amendment that creates a surplus with zero, effective tomorrow.  We can get this surplus with the first step, $1 trillion over 5 years. We can also do this without

And those two things are not mutually exclusive. They both are terribly important to the well being of our children. We need them to have the help they need to be healthy adults and to have a life that they can be proud of and be able to contribute to our country.  I thank the Senator for his leadership.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families program has successfully carried out activities and services that support family reunification, family preservation, community-based family support, and early education programs to families in foster care and all other non-adoption and non-special needs families. Programs such as these are very important to foster care services in rural and remote areas. They often are more feasible for non-adoption or non-special needs families and, therefore, can be much more cost effective.  The combined information and collaboration between the State and Federal governments in promoting programs in the area of family reunification, children in foster care, and early education of children are undoubtedly the most effective ways of ensuring that all children are receiving the services they are promised, that they are cared for appropriately, and that foster and adoptive parents receive the support that their children deserve. It is with great satisfaction that I recognize these groups of individuals in our society, and also commend their

I have stated it is our intention at this point to take up the continuing resolution and to vote on that immediately following the Senate vote on the conference agreement to be on Monday. So we expect to take up that legislation on Monday afternoon and the entire week that that legislation will be in the House of Representatives. We have not yet decided whether or not that legislation would require a second vote of either limit or budget. It will probably require a second vote, a tie vote on the budget.  I understand that there has been some controversy on the Republican side as to whether or not that bill would be constitutional because the courts have suggested that it is constitutional under the constitutional provisions of article I, section 8. We should not get into a policy of what the law is. So I understand some Members have the greatest desire to put forward a constitutional amendment.

The $500 billion of tax cuts means a big spending program.

Mr. President, our current immigration system is a travesty. It is inefficient, uncompassionate, and dangerous. It doesn't serve America's economic or social interests, and it is not fair to our Nation or our people. That is why the committee has developed a system of increasing the amount of money the Government will spend on immigration and border security and by the time the current limit is reached in 10 years from now would be more than $500 billion. That is the total cost of the current system of immigration and border security and includes both the many other officers who are members of the U.S. Border Patrol, and our police and other State and local agencies that assist in the overall security of the U.S. and the border.  The amendment by Senator McConnell offered today takes important steps in addressing the immigration system in the Senate.

I think the assistant Democratic leader's counsel is very appropriate and hopefully will be listened to. The debate we have is a large State/small State debate on health care reform and tax reform that has passed the Senate twice already and passed the House twice already and passed the President of the United States three times and passed the House on four separate occasions with both the House bill and Senate bill the same number of times that the President passed the House bill to his State in the House and Senate committee. We do not need to be here debating an entirely different issue because we have a similar bill that was introduced in the other body that is now going to be offered in the other body so we can formula and all of this back and forth, and it is an issue on which we can agree, and then there will be that very sensible vote we all voted for in November, and I think that is the next step in dealing with health care reform.

consideration jersey waiver 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against House Resolution 231 because the resolution violates section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act. The resolution provides for consideration of the bill on a limited time frame but provides that the bill may not be considered until September 11, 2001. Section 426(a) imposes a waiver of the time limit on the budget resolution on days on which the Congress is in session and takes the course of business on this day to take the necessary action to avoid the date of the September 11 attack.  In the case of the motion to recommit this resolution and the jersey bill, the closed rules provided in the rule do not apply to these resolutions and give rise to a point of order under the Congressional Budget Act. The point of order is sustained.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Hampshire does not ban abortion for rape in its hospitals, yet it is State law in Rhode Island to ban the procedure for voluntary or coerced abortion. I have not seen any Member of this body on this side of the aisle, I say to my friend from Idaho, say that this particular, although imperfect, procedure--for at least one reason--is not a State right, because, as the Senator from Idaho so articulately explained, in most States there are

Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin our remarks today which will focus on our Make It in America agenda, the agenda that we put forward for America's future by reflecting on the words of our President and giving him credit for the future he has and hopes we share. The American people elected him President because they know that America was taken from them by a Speaker who promised he would protect and defend them against an onslaught of foreign enemies.  I think the statement that my colleague from New York made earlier today reminded us what he said on that issue on Friday night remarks that our President must carry out the laws and the policies that were put in place by the Republican leadership of this House in a bipartisan manner as well as the other body, the Senate. And that is the difference between the bill that has been sent to the President by the Senate and the legislation the Senate sent back, a bill that this House did not consider. I think

Madam Speaker, the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement means growth and more jobs for the largest exporter and manufacturing nation in the world, the United States. It is the most comprehensive trade agreement since NAFTA. And Colombia is the most American of all the recipients of this deal and the largest recipient overall of new jobs. I am delighted the administration was able to support this agreement and encourage the promotion of American jobs.  Colombia is also America's oldest ally. Many Colombians came to the United States as refugees when it was a Spanish colony. By any measure, America is a better friend of Colombia than the country that our forefathers came to and demanded its independence. It is important for this administration to work with Colombia, and we are glad we were able to be helpful in this process.  We are also happy the United States and Colombia signed a Comprehensive and Progressive United States Trade Partnership Agreement. This agreement reaffirms the United States' commitment to strengthening

They are the people that create some of our most important industries and many of our most creative stories that we have here in Washington. It is a shame that we are spending so much time talking about something that the Obama administration just voted last week not to do, but we are going to do it anyway, and that is to help small businesses, those individuals who have worked their entire life and they have paid taxes for and are ready to go out and hire the new people to take their job or to provide a benefit to their employers, particularly for their children.

Mr. Speaker, this is one more bill designed to punish the Federal workforce and to discourage the very people whom we need to join the Federal Government in the first place and encourage and encourage and encourage the administration and the Congress of the United States to get out of this current year situation we find ourselves in.  It is immoral to do this because it is bad policy to discourage hiring that is necessary and that will be successful because it will bring Federal Government dollars to States that would otherwise go out of Federal enforcement offices. So this is clearly wrong. It is not designed to get back at us. It is designed to do precisely what the other body does, and that is ask the other body to make a decision and an administration to make a decision.  This time we are taking the route the other body is taking. I think this shows the weakness of the politics of this place and the weakness of the House of Representatives as a House

If we vote against Justice Kennedy's nomination, we are sending a signal that is both false and counterproductive.

Mr. President, when you live in Vermont, you must endure a long, hard winter. To keep spirits up, a Vermonter will look for signs of the coming winter as they walk past frozen roads and dead livestock with their butts in the air and out of reach of their own snowplows. But in every year that I have been a Member of this body and live in Vermont, snow is one of those signs that we can't ignore. With snowstorms throughout our State and highways closed every single day of the year, the Vermonter has to spend much of their winter hoping and praying that the next one will be not so cold.  The weight of this economic weight has a profound and hard effect on the financial stability of Vermonters. In fact, in 2004, much of the new government--early retirement, it is called--benefits Vermonters now went unpaid for. That, by the way, is the result

While the tariff relief provisions of the China Free Trade Agreement should have the most-favored-nation status, I believe it is important for us to stay alert to the economic development of many other countries in Asia and Africa that are experiencing high unemployment rates and political unrest, including China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, and Taiwan. And I also believe that encouraging market access and improved government management of these countries is appropriate in order to encourage the development of market opportunities in these important economies.

Mr. President, some of the most successful small businesses in America originate with an entrepreneur who takes a leap of faith to try something new. In the last few years, a small business that would not be considered conventional has begun to grow and become part of the fabric of our Nation's economy and manufacturing sector. Yet many years of growth have been taken by the Government and are of little consequence to the State and local governments and taxpayers that employ these individuals. The Idaho Land and Water Conservation Fund, or LWRF, was created to alleviate this threat by subsidizing the first few businesses that are incorporated as REI units in the State. The LWRF was created in 1974 and has provided more than $1 billion for environmental and land conservation projects in the State of Idaho since that time. It was first authorized by Congress in 1976. Since that time, LWRF has been a powerful force in Idaho's economy. Today, however

The reason for this is because today the Federal Government is at or above the highest rate of debt that the United States has been for any other country in our history. Today, the debt has grown from $4 trillion in fiscal year 1995 to $10.1 trillion today, according to corporate disclosures recently. If we look at the actual record that we have been led to believe that we have of the debt of the United States, Chairman Filner has it right when he said that the debt, the total debt, is only about 2 percent of our gross domestic product, 2 percent.  With regard to paying off the debt, it is less than 1 percent of our gross domestic product. It is under $400 billion

It is an issue that has been just as important as it has been for the energy industry itself in this time of record energy prices and increased volatility in oil and gas markets. And that is why it is so important that we make sure that the Department of Energy can continue to be that source of lead in America's transportation sector.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>                                   {code}<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for H.R 347 which grants the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to the 100th Infantry Battalion of the United States Army, based at Fort Bliss, Texas, for a nearly 30-year career of humanitarian service to our Nation in World War II. Japanese Americans were legally established in the United States by Congress on December 14, 1882. By all accounts they fought courageously for their country in Europe and then fought the best they could to defend themselves collectively as the United States Army called them.  Following World War I and the end of the war with Germany, the United States paid tribute to them by granting them the Congressional Gold Medal for bravery in defense of our country from the beginning of the conflict until December of 1945. And not a single soldier from California lost their life in the name of the flag.  According to the Congressional Gold Medal and other official government recognition certificates from the Holocaust,

Mr. President, the torture debate took another deeply troubling turn yesterday. The Nation learned the CIA had destroyed videotapes of its employees in the act of brutal interrogation procedures. The truth about the role of torture in the war on terrorism has not been deeply investigated in the past 4 years. Congress will continue to investigate the specific circumstances surrounding the destruction of these tapes that has taken us so far away from the truth. But government officials have admitted that the videotapes were destroyed because of a legal technicality of the former Director of Central Intelligence, Michael V. Hayden.  President Bush was not briefed on these tapes before 9/11, and the administration has not held public hearings on them since. In 2004, a bipartisan Senate committee acted on hearings. Now we are considering an unprecedented package of funding legislation.  I believe the Senate should provide a full accounting for this information. It is now clear that, as recently as July 2001, the CIA deliberately

Mr. President, America has come a long way in addressing discrimination in the workplace since the days my ancestors faced ``No Irish Need Apply'' signs. Americans have come a long way in the fight for legal protections against employment discrimination by gays and lesbians and other minorities and the rights to equal compensation for them in courts and across the political spectrum.  The issue of equal pay for equal work for all is not only a constitutional issue but a moral and civil one as well. For far too long, there has been a great deal of fear and back and forth on the Irish-American question, mainly fueled by fear of the men and women of the gay and lesbian community. While great progress has been made in the years since the Supreme Court decision of Hollings v. Perry, my home State of Vermont has remained very resistant to this issue. When we passed the Equal Pay Act, it had a very clear mandate that our laws apply equally to men and

President Jiang will, I am confident, reaffirm the U.S. position and let everyone know that we are deeply concerned about Beijing's human rights abuses and reform, including the release of political prisoners.

Mr. President, this is an occasion of some happiness for those of us who have spent a substantial amount of time in the Senate pushing for a big reform of the home health service system in this country. It is an occasion that is being celebrated by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle in the House of Representatives as part of their effort to take us back to a system where home health care is left in the hands of the independent and not the government because of all the problems that snow people, deadbeat dads, people who cannot pay child support for the child who was killed in an automobile accident are causing in our country.  I want to take just a few minutes, because the effort for changes that I think we need to make in this country as a result of the Mitchell report has had such a dramatic impact on the health care of all Americans, to explain why, and why it is so important that we do this

I would like to have the gentleman share his thoughts on that.   CC  outsourcing it to China would be heroic. They certainly can handle it. The county boards should not be locked out of money which they are responsible for. And I will have the discussion with Mr. Everett as to whether or not that is the way we can work out. But certainly, if we want a win-win that this country can not make a case on any investment, which this country cannot make a case on, let us at least have a word with the people who are involved.

They would not get the credit they need.  We have a little surprise here for you because we pass a legislation that causes an unexpected consequence. We limit credit availability for middle class families. We also give Congress a veto override. That is one of the great surprises about our rules.  We have plenty of meetings on the rule before us today. We have had an enormous number of people calling and talking about the rules. There have been a lot of amendments offered. I have not heard one argument on behalf of the rule. I think that is because people know they are playing fast and loose with the rules. We have amendments. We have been called. I think

Madam Speaker, I am in Washington to continue to fight for Utah's business owners and our working families affected by the coronavirus. The Paycheck Protection Program has the key to closing the deal for small business owners here at home and keeping my constituents employed.  Paycheck Protection was created by a bipartisan vote of 359-54 in the House. It offers the American workers a certain measure of protection in the event of a government shutdown. It is crucial that a successful passage of this important legislation this week will keep us on track for the numbers to reach our goals.  One of the toughest challenges facing small business in this country is to recruit workers. It is imperative that we not be punished by making these tough decisions because the largest employer in this country, employer number one, the United States of America, pays the health insurance for their employees.  We must look to the Paycheck Protection Program because it provides a step in the right direction to secure

And the other part is to not be able to use that authority to do other kinds of things like create more trees that cause irreparable harm to Americans.  As a Member who represents Fort Collins, Colorado, this may sound extreme, but it is important to keep in mind that we are doing something important to the people of the Western United States.

I absolutely do not support that.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not yielded as much time as we have to discuss the role of the Federal Government in this time of economic stress. No, the institution that we have in this body is not designed for this kind of circumstance. I do not believe we can ask our constituents to sacrifice their most precious resource, their ability to buy health care, with such an artificial timetable for implementing our reforms.

That is how my friend from Georgia attacked this legislation and attacked my efforts to make the House of Representatives have more checks and balances.  Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely important that we do what we can to keep the checks on the hands of our own party and our own President.

Madam President, I am in wholehearted agreement with the intent of the amendment before us, and I commend my colleague from Iowa for his sincere efforts in this matter. I think Iowa is a good State and should have its federal welfare and child welfare programs funded as it is in the other body. This is an area where we can have real competition in the national welfare programs for the purpose of giving the most needy youth an opportunity to participate.  I think it is also a matter where we can move the money closer to where it should be, to help more young people to build the future that they desire. The problem is that there is an inconsistency here in the budget resolution to distribute welfare funds between programs. If we are to effectively help youth to begin their lives, then we must make sure the funds have adequate offsets for these programs, and I urge the chair to accept this amendment.

job planning arguing 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I think we have to put this in perspective. What we are arguing here is not ending family planning, it is saying who is going to do it and how and when should there be a job in the first place and what the cost is going to be to fund it.   programmers do not have any idea what we are arguing for. I do not know what they have been taught in school because the last time I was here I did not know what Planned Parenthood and Catholic Schools are. The only one I know is the Hinchey School of Business, which is in Chicago. The vast majority of other programs we learn about in school are paid for by the taxpayer through a formula that puts strings on what we do.   I would say we have to be consistent about this because in order to survive and to keep our operating expenses low in the future, our goal has to be to get the job done.

Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding. Madam Speaker, to borrow a line from President Reagan: Here we go again. In the last Congress Democrats made another case for this bill by arguing that we needed to reform the rules to give Congress more time to address the legislation before us. The good people of Wisconsin will recall that we put these amendments on the same list that the last Congress put on the same list that we put on the last Congress on the same list that the States put on the same list. We were trying to be germane. We were trying to clarify that the bill, which was sent down from the Senate, would include 17 different state constitutional amendments.  I objected to that, but I am satisfied that the point was made, and I think it is the best way to get this thing moving forward, given the best of intentions of the Speaker and the Committee on Rules, which I believe led to this

But if we wanted to make sure that the farmers and producers of this country had as much tax relief as the farmers and producers of any other country in the world, we would also be willing to stop capital gains taxation on the capital gains of a farmer.

Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act (REINS Act). It is unfortunate but Congress does need to curb government overreach and transparency. It is not appropriate that the executive branch may dictate to Congress the results of its regulatory approval.  In H.R. 10, the government runs endless regulatory loops, bypassing Congress' oversight responsibility. Under the REINS Act, States and local governments are unable to submit their final regulatory guidelines to the Federal Government for review or comment. The REINS Act permits the Attorney General to grant immunity from congressional review when the Attorney General deems it appropriate. This allows agencies to submit information regarding just how much money they will spend in their regulations before submitting it to Congress.  For example, EPA and the Coast Guard considered the impacts on their ports and waterways that new regulations would have on seaports. EPA determined that the proposed regulation would increase business

Mr. Speaker, President Trump, along with his Republican choir here in Congress, is sabotaging your healthcare. First, his administration put hurdles to enrollment by slashing health insurers' reimbursement rates for a second time and your pay increases for the first time in the history of Medicare and Medicaid as a result of cuts in Medicaid and Medicare payments to providers that have cost so many Americans their jobs and their health care. The President wants to cut off all that support for important healthcare in the future as well as his tax cuts for the rich that are key to his status as the richest person in this country.  The Speaker of the House and the Democrats in the House and the Senate and the White House are chorus choir at this. We will tell you that. The American people have asked for that, and the President should answer for it.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

fed policy yellen

Mr. President, I want to briefly explain for the record my votes on the nomination of Janet Yellen to be a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  I think the Fed is at the point where we should allow the financial markets to keep growing in order to meet the economic challenges that we are facing right now in America and indeed the world. But the policy that Janet Yellen is brought up to be part of will undoubtedly increase the systemic risks to the entire economy.  For example, there are concerns about some of the increased risk she will bring to our financial markets from the subsequent change in the monetary policy decisions that will be coming out of the Fed. And I would strongly oppose that. She is the head of the Fed. What she brings to that position will harm both the United States and the world economy and what the economy could ultimately look like.  I have voted against Fed leadership for similar reasons

I think this could be the beginning of a real process, even if you were to vote yes, it could still be followed by a lot of talking and debate, which is long overdue.

I thank my colleagues from Rhode Island, Iowa, Senators Wyden and Merkley, and Senator Brown who spent a little time talking about this. There is an important distinction. This bill is not a cost-of-living increase for senior citizens as the health care program is known. This bill does give the President the authority to allow this out-of-pocket tax deduction so that there can be a $600 deduction for senior citizens so they can spend their money on what they want and not have this Iowa premium cost them $2,000 more.  Also, the Senator from Iowa has pointed out that the repeal of the Graham-Cassidy requirement that insurance companies provide essential health benefits to their customers means higher costs for patients, more illness and medical expenses, and lower quality. That is the case.  But let me further clarify, because I know the Senator from Iowa wants to get to the heart of this issue, the Graham-Cassidy

I am pleased to join Senator Dorgan and my colleagues in support of this legislation which will ensure programs that reduce the threat of violence against students in this country will be funded for years to come. This legislation will also reauthorize the General Education Act for 6 years which in turn will make this autumn's federal holidays a time for families to get together and make the biggest investment in their children's futures.  I would like to add a special caveat to the stated concerns of the sponsors of this bill that this legislation goes well beyond the TRIO program and will not affect current military missions or operations or pending litigation or the continuation of DOD or OSHA programs. The reason this bill should be supported is because it embodies the leadership of the Senator from New Mexico and is the right program for this Nation.

I know the promise of health care reform was never to bring down the national debt. So how about now? Just 5 months from now, in 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual deficit will reach $1 trillion and the national debt will be $11.4 trillion.  This is the ultimate unfunded mandate and it is not responsible on the part of the U.S. Government. This

It has not been easy at all to get a bill as big as this done in such a short time because there are some Members on both sides who have guest-worker programs and who want to try and make sure those guest workers go home and get some education or some training.

The Congressional Budget Office also estimates that all fiscal year 1996 and the total consideration of all fiscal year 1996 Government outlays and receipts in excess of a total of $500 billion is within the President's 302(b) allocation; consequently, all levels of consideration in the 302(b) allocation are accommodated.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is similar to an amendment that I offered last year in the last Congress when we passed a bill that I was working with the distinguished chairman on as the ranking member of the authorizing committee. That amendment put in place the target date for the end of this year. That is the day we have to send out the next set of letters explaining this cuts in contract authority, this authorization. So we did not say, No, we are going to cut the spending authority for Social Security, we are going to cut the authorization, we are going to McAveney it. We had the contrary effect of showing that we are not serious about doing things and holding the deficit down in fiscal year 1994. So we want to allow time for them to work out those differences so that we will have an authorizing committee and we can get to the right place on

For more than 200 years, the British Raj has ruled the 6th largest country in the world. Since the British were inspired to establish the colony of Hong Kong as a British colony during the Napoleonic Wars, our people have been born into a different society.

senator congress commission 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, earlier this year, I joined Senator Kyl and others in introducing legislation which would eliminate the Federal estate tax. In terms of helping taxpayers to identify some assets which are subject to the tax and to which they should have an interest in resolving the tax due on them after death, Congress has long provided incentives for the payment of these taxes. Senator Kyl, with our help and leadership, and other Members of the Senate during the last Congress on a bipartisan basis, provided these tax incentives to help those who will not have a will in the year of their death to ensure that commission was made of the estate tax. By removing the death tax and making estate and gift taxes on death taxes tax-free, the tax burden on the many taxpaying American families will be significantly reduced. It was hoped that the repeal of the estate tax, at least in the form of the current estate tax surcharge of $1,000, would result in

Members should realize that this bill will continue to fund the $1.8 billion estimated to be necessary for the theater defense program for fiscal year 2009 and beyond to fund additional assets for this account in fiscal year 2010 and beyond as the cost of which is estimated to total $ million. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Darrell Issa of California, chairman of the committee, said in a letter to our Republican colleagues to the effect that he should allow us to raise the debt limit if we want to empower this administration, to use the emergency powers of the United States to increase the debt limit.  The Committee on the Judiciary has been authorized to raise the debt limit in 4 previous instances: To permit the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct appropriate review of pending Treasury receipts of income from foreign countries, currency debits of United States persons, bond sales by United States persons, and exchange agreements; to authorize

Mr. Speaker, $14.4 trillion; $1.6 trillion every year added onto that national debt. The people in November, 2010, spoke loudly. We are listening. It is the right thing to do to change that debt and to make sure that we control that spending and to make sure we get our finances in order again by having a growing economy and keeping the Government small and doing things like that for America and listening to what people are saying. And listening to what those of us who were watching on television heard again on the floor of the House here tonight loudly.  There are great, great problems in this country. There are mistakes in our economic policies. There are problems in our healthcare system, and we have to fix them. The most serious thing to do is to get our fiscal house in order again, and to do it with a growing economy, and to keep our financial house in order.  I commend the Speaker for his leadership on this issue.

If this Administration is serious about negotiating the price of prescription drugs, Medicare will not be a part of the process. This administration must ensure that the public and senior citizens are informed and not misled by their leaders about their negotiations. The Members of this House should know how serious our colleagues are about negotiating the price of prescription drugs. They must be aware that it is already illegal for the administration to negotiate for the American people.  President Bush and my colleagues in the House need to demand that this administration participate in the negotiations as a part of what was promised to all Medicare beneficiaries.

At 5 p.m. there will be a cloture vote on the President's nomination of Miguel Estrada to be a U.S. circuit court judge for the DC Circuit until 6 p.m. That will not be a 7- or 8-hour vote since 5 p.m. February 5 is the last day of the 104th Congress. I would hope people on both sides of the aisle will come and discuss this today and reach a unanimous-consent agreement on an orderly way to conduct that vote.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

We had the opportunity to meet Simon when I was in the House in 1975 when Paul began his 30 year leadership of the American Jewish Congress in New York City as a speaker and public figure in support of a new Congress and new government that would not only reform our Federal Government but would also reduce the gap in the wealth of the American people between those that rise in the system and those who work. That is really the purpose of this Congress. To begin to begin to reduce the gap between those who start in the system and those who have the opportunities to own themselves in the system. We did not decide that there was a gap in wealth until the late 1970's. That is when my dad was also an individual who had been a public official in his early 50's

The Republican leadership must act to allow legislation to come to the floor and vote so amendments can be offered so Congresswoman Norton can make her bill better. I know she has questions about a bill that she has supported for 2 years now that has Gingrich or, for that matter, even spent a significant amount of time on that committee with her. She is out there trying to make that bill better. And the Republican leadership continues to offer excuses about how this won't happen.

I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our thoughts and prayers to the family and friends of Congressman Hyde on the occasion of his death last month. His support and leadership will be deeply missed by all who knew him and those who loved him in the Sixth District of Illinois and throughout the Jewish, pro-Israel, civil rights, and religious communities of the United States.  Congressman Hyde has been a true public servant. He was always focused on the bottom line and on moving things forward for the people of the Sixth District of Illinois, not least of all those who have suffered grievously in the name of freedom and justice. Through his advocacy for freedom, justice and peace, Congressman Hyde has helped to ensure that all people have an opportunity to live

Have we not just seen that again in Iraq and the conflict on the ground in the last month or so in Afghanistan where risk to the United States and the support to the coalition would be seriously reduced by this Congress failing to act and failing to commit the resources and support that we so desperately need in that area of risk management and risk reduction and the other efforts the administration has made in these years and years and years and years and years beyond in corporate America and on Wall Street?  It is astounding to me how the leadership of this House is avoiding the tough choices to be sure to avoid a monumental mistake. I really believe we ought to be embarrassed, we ought to be embarrassed about these two, but the answer is to ignore them and continue to debate them.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

If you are going to require everyone to make more energy-costed decisions for their families and their families need to make choices they cannot make for themselves and their families should not have the rules changed so that those who have some health care benefits and veterans can have tax loopholes so that they can tax the pay of the children so that it will not be tax exempt to people that the Committee amended this legislation to do.

Just to be clear, this is about low-income energy Americans that are just barely making enough to make it a little bit clear, that just to be clear that what you are hearing from these folks that are struggling to get by is not just about the natural gas at home and the transportation costs that high oil prices bring, but it is the fact that this administration is trying to hold affordable energy subsidies hostage for an arbitrary point in time in the tax bill that gets from now through March 31. So what we have is a policy that will put consumers in harm's way.  With that, let me ask my colleagues, just to be clear about what this is about. This is about the low-income Americans and the overregulation by the administration of the energy tax policy in this country today.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

laid congress efforts

Congress also extended the unemployment insurance so long as the need for help is no longer an emergency and if the unemployed have sought assistance in the past month but could not find work because of their illness or their work responsibilities and should not have to be laid off again in the next month and have not been promised work in the past month despite efforts by Democrats to get that done. I was proud to vote for these extensions on a bipartisan basis.  The amendment I filed yesterday to extend unemployment benefits to all Americans is the product of the kind of hard work we have been doing this last year to have what was, before, like that initial extension, the only effort to address the problems of our Nation's jobless workers.

This is a convoluted, complicated motion to recommit. We are looking at a temporary extension in a way that is quite inappropriate. When the Congress is out there sending out information to the American people, this is where the business ought to be, the way the public sees the country, where the news media ought to be, where the scientific and political experts in America ought to be, and where some Members of the Congress ought to make those decisions on what is in the best interest of

commonsense chamber tax 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, this amendment is a commonsense reform that allows the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide an accurate score to those of us in Congress who are paid by taxpayers as part of the tax system. What a great benefit to taxpayers. Congress should be able to run the most honest and efficient tax policy in the history of the world. The issue here is one of fairness and fiscal responsibility which I think the Chamber ought to reflect on, and my amendment takes sensible steps to make sure that our tax laws are fair. This amendment allows the Joint Committee on Taxation to measure our tax laws with regard to transparency and openness. It requires that Members of Congress--Republicans and Democrats alike--come forth and outline measures we deem sensible measures sensible measures sensible measures sensible measures sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible sensible commonsense

repeals act hole

Thank you. Mr. Chairman, contrary to what Republicans have said on the floor, the Republican budget will impose new cuts on today's seniors. The Republican budget would increase the prescription drug drug copay by $5, and that copay is not included in any other part of the bill that the Republicans are trying to pass to change the law under which the government must act to preserve the benefits of Medicare. The only way you can increase the prescription drug copay and make sure that Medicare recipients and seniors who get part A and part B get the same amount of benefits they get under the law is that you hole up the loophole in the law and then act as though you didn't care that the law wasn't repealed by the American people on a referendum.  Now, you hear that the Republicans say, well, the way to repeal the law is to sink or swim. You do that by taking a bait and switch. You are telling seniors in

The cost to the State of Michigan for this compensation was estimated at about $33 million last year. Clearly it is high enough to deserve higher salaries than is received in other States of the Union that require Federal funds. However, the Federal Government must look beyond a disclosure of how its Government funds are expended. The Federal Government must look into the financial information required by the plaintiffs in this case.  The plaintiffs have filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Michigan to recover money that the Government has spent on the State of Michigan to cover the cost of paying officers of the United States that were

While I recognize the need for greater border protection, I also believe that we should take time and invest in homeland security and to ensure that the safety and security of our Nation is assured. I know firsthand that Florida's ports are a critical part of our Nation's logistics network and provide more than enough capacity for our TSA personnel to inspect, check, and inspect cargo.

When I came to Congress over a year ago and I came into a place where 10 scored bills were reported, I do not think any Democrat voted for any of them, and it is true that I lost a few votes, because some of the Republicans voted against some of these proposals. But as far as I am concerned, you are paying for our success, by voting for ours.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

cents gao injured 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, according the Rand Corp., only 43 cents of every dollar spent in the malpractice system goes to the injured patient. According to GAO, according to Congresswoman McCollum, 78 percent of all injuries suffered are due to medical errors by injured patients. While the cost of insurance may be paid for, it is not paid for by the patient. It is paid by others who do not have to pay for it either. Mr. President, 39 cents of every dollar paid in insurance costs is borne by patients and therefore it pays to patients to be injured.  As pointed out by the Senator from Arizona, when patients have insurance, they pay the costs of their health care expenses that are not minuscule costs that patients pay Wei Li Wei Li Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei Wei Li Wei Li Wei Li Wei gao

That question has to be resolved in both of the sentences in this bill that will be handed down in a matter of minutes and a Speaker who should not be here.  I am now joined on the floor by Mr. Dreier from the Judiciary Committee, and in his absence we are joined by Mr. Goodlatte from the Judiciary Committee, who also has a lot of questions to ask.

Tom is a man of great leadership who rose from the ashes of a failed campaign and risen from a life in prison to rise to becoming one of the most visible and influential mayors in the United States, a man who all of the citizens of Aurora want to be their mayor. He was an admired and respected leader by people across the Nation. But for the people of Aurora, it was his political courage, his courage to stand firm and oppose the crippling law of Chicago when he knew the true price and effect would come to the citizens of Aurora, Illinois.

You can denigrate a taxpayer for his or her responsibility in approving taxes, but that is really a laughable assertion.

I wish to begin by saying that this legislation is about the next 100 months of the 10 years of the 40-year reform of the Federal health care system for the 60 million Americans who currently have insurance but who would like to purchase health insurance that covers 10 billion people, including 22 million children. Republicans will continue to address this issue with legislation as the legislation that Committee on Finance represents until our policies reform the health care system.  It is the passage of this legislation, the Clinton-Mitchell health care reform plan, which will close the doughnut hole by creating a new Federal block grant that is significantly more generous to low- and moderate-income families than the President's Health Care Reform Act

I am grateful to Chairman Bill Young and the Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs Chairman Bill Natcher for agreeing to this amendment that was introduced by the other side of the aisle.  This is an important tool that we can all agree is an effective tool to help our veteran small businesses. We do not need to be a mean-spirited half measure that reduces conversion of VA small business loans, and that is exactly what this bill does.  Many veterans own small businesses, a fact that we need to be on the record on. Since 1991, we have increased lending by about 33 percent to small businesses by incorporating a T-site program. This is a real benefit for veterans and their businesses, and the legislation before us today increases it by 33 percent for the year 2002.

shot hate local 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.  On February 6, 2000, a local police officer in upstate New York shot and killed a homeless man after the man robbed a gas station at gunpoint. The incident prompted the post office to ask the community to register hate crimes with the city, and the legislature passed a hate crimes bill in 2000. Unfortunately, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act was not included in the final version of the criminal justice reform law, and so the new law is needed.  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that

Let me give you an example of the kind of request the chairman has made and that I have made on this side of the aisle here to appeal to my colleague from California.  He did not support the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as it was originally enacted and has said that it is illegal in all but two places in the world.  But he included in the Intelligence Authorization Act last year an amendment to permit the telecom industry to query their records. And let me repeat that because I think

Madam Speaker, I rise today to deliver a message from my district. It is a message I have heard in my townhalls and from my people in my local school district and from over 350,000 seniors in both parties to the People's Republic of China and to leaders in Beijing: they have got to step up and do more to enhance trade and exchanges with the United States of America.  I call on the Chinese Communist Party to change its act or send us back. But the President is right. In 2009 we warned Mr. Xi that excessive criticism of American leaders-- state-based pressure, economic sanctions, violence, and a perceived pattern of impunity--are all counterproductive.  It is ironic that Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi must sign an agreement with Mr. Trump to assuage Mr. Madame President. They in turn must sign it.  This agreement has important provisions to strengthen the U.S.-China relationship. In a

Over the past 12 months, the administration has promised that they would give us a comprehensive unemployment benefit package, but they have not yet done so because they insist on negotiating with no leverage.  According to my fellow Republicans and this gentleman's leadership, we should not negotiate with the Democrats on this issue because, ``No Democrat could possibly offer an adequate proposal on unemployment insurance.''  That statement is unadulterated nonsense. Despite their numerous attempts to turn the clock back on this historic program and cut benefits to people who have lost their homes, they refuse to negotiate on this critical issue.

Through the U.S.-India Economic and Security Review Commission Act of 1997, Congress will enact a plan to reform the failed Sino-Indian Business Enterprise (SIBE) Program. A SIBE program has been an inefficient, non-market oriented business enterprise in the United States. The SIBE Program has focused on short-term development and small scale contracts while ignoring our long-term national security interests. Simply put, SIBE is a business-as-usual program.

These and other cities have followed the lead of North Carolina, where over 60 percent of those seeking to adopt were same-sex couples in 2001 and where more than half the same-sex families are expecting next year to have a child in that year than in any year in the last decade as compared to same-sex drop rise.  It is clear that these numbers will improve, and in fact we have seen an increase in same-sex adoptions over the last several years.

Absolutely, and on top of the balanced budget amendment we have that very important line item veto which we, the majority party in the House, passed in November of 1990 in the House by an overwhelming vote of 235 to 200, and then President Bush signed into law on January 31 of this year by a vote of 235 to 201, putting that important line item veto in place and overturning Democrat districts across this country.  The President promised in campaign 1992 that he would veto welfare reform in order to control Government spending. No Republicans voted for welfare reform in that campaign, and it has been vetoed before. And now we are coming back, Mr. Speaker, to take the line item veto off the floor of the House.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This is one of those cases that goes far beyond the issue of raising money to fund a special interest organization to which you might be so devoted because of your ties to that organization. My personal reasons for voting against this resolution are those outlined below in the next few minutes and they should be enough reason for Members of the Senate to oppose it if they care about the savings that may come from raising the minimum wage in this country from $5.15 per hour to $7 per hour in the next year alone according estimates that the Center for American Progress made yesterday. If this committee cares about expanding opportunity and opportunity for hardworking Americans, it ought to work to expand opportunity for hardworking American families to make ends

Madam President, at the end of this session of Congress, one of the Senate's longest-serving Members will be retiring. Senator Claiborne Pell's sterling 35-year record--actually longer than all but five United States Senators from both sides of the political aisle--should help lay to rest the record of an America that has its very foundation in our efforts to create a truly equal opportunity society for all Americans.  Claiborne Pell is not a Democrat or a Republican. He is a Kentuckian, and a Louisvilleian. I know this because I first met him here in the Senate shortly after he won election to the Senate in 1950, because that is where he grew up, where his family has roots, and where his political career began. As Governor of Kentucky in 1951, he used his Governor's name and was elected as State treasurer. Since then, Senator Pell has governed in Kentucky more than 47 years and served both in the U.S. House of Representatives and

Congress responded to that, taking an opportunity to help a situation where a person might want to work as a journalist and might want to view this viewpoint, he might want to see a film or he might want to read an editorial or something that he thought was useful and wanted to see how to help his fellow citizens get back on their feet.

The legislation also addresses key cyber issues: addressing terrorists' ability to hack into Federal networks, and establishing stronger cybersecurity systems to identify, analyze, and commend a first- or second-strike threat.  Our discussions of cyber security in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 has greatly improved our Nation's ability to respond to terrorism, through the strengthening of our defenses against the spread of cyber attacks, while facilitating the sharing of information between Federal Government agencies

I have long worked with the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and our distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee on efforts to combat the issue of human trafficking in the country of Iraq and throughout the world and its ongoing long battle against international organized crime.  The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2007, as amended by the House version, honors Mr. Wilberforce's lifelong dedication to fighting against the enslavement of the Iraqi people, and enhances the prevention, prosecution, prosecution, and adjudication of persons subject to slave labor.  Mr. Speaker, we can all agree that many men, women, and children have been displaced by the civil war in Iraq. Unfortunately, these are not simply refugee issues or crises of choice or political affiliation. These human rights violations occur day in and day out.

responsibility california manage

If I may ask my friend from California, I am sure she has read this, but the Los Angeles Times editorial said it best today: ``A few California immigrants stand as a model for what all should strive for on a daily basis.'' They said that it is better to ``be proud to be California than to be an immigrant.'' It is better to `` manage your life on your own terms'' than to ``put the burden of responsibility on others.''  I think those are very American values, American ideals. I do not know how many of them you know who say, ``I am a Californian and I am proud of it,'' I would be remiss if I did not answer that and compliment Senator Feinstein, the distinguished Senator from California, for her integrity, her energy, and her passion for this issue.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I just want to make the point that the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio by the end of this cycle is scheduled for the floor. He did not come and offer his amendment to block the ability of the FDIC to hold a money market fund. What we are going to do is hold the entire Treasury Department accountable by setting rules on holding funds, people that are so stressed that they will not be able to do their jobs, which is good.

Madam President, I enjoyed listening to the Senator from Rhode Island, as I always do. His passion for education is always on his sleeve and never gets out of the way. He has worked in this area so long and so hard that I care so much about his passion for the future and for the promise that we have that we are going to make this a better Nation and a better place for our children to continue to pay their debts and to help us make investments in the future. So it is great to have the Senator from Rhode Island on the floor. The fact that we have the Senator from Rhode Island for some amount of time to lend loans to young people and ensure that they have some help with their education is a real rarity. He has always been at the forefront, I know, of things that can help our young people. I am so pleased to have him on the floor. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I believe we have to expand the base of opportunity that we have for all of us to start moving into the middle class and be able to benefit from the future.

As Secretary of State, I hold the President to the same standard that other Federal officers are held to--fidelity to executive orders. To appoint an Assistant Secretary of State who has not displayed high personal and professional standards is, in my view, entirely consistent with executive policy.

Final sequence: 

What I think is exciting is that, you know, we are affecting the hospitals and doctors, and we are asking them to deal with lesser responsibility in this area as well. I think the public will see and then we will have a better idea of what the insurance companies need and need not to do in Medicare and health care reform because we are offering them real choices instead of just telling them that they have to be like our neighbors and get sick because the government says so in your hand.  We are certainly trying to provide choices that do not necessarily get the same coverage that a regular person gets, and you are absolutely right. In many parts of the world there are citizens that they can do for very little as a result of our health care system, but in the United States of America there are very few folks in the business of working, as doctors or nurses, that are willing to take time away from their families to worry about whether

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on behalf of the thoroughly bipartisan bill before us, House Resolution 427. I think it would be unfair and inappropriate to characterize this as a partisan measure. Certainly that would be an overstatement to say that the leadership and colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come to this position. This is a bipartisan bill that has had a strong coalition of support throughout the entire State of Kentucky.  I want to thank Congressman Bob Marshall and his staff and his staff, including Charlie Graves and Greg Leslie for their work. This is a very important piece of legislation that they have worked on for a long time. There has been no dispute over the outstanding work they have done. There has also been a remarkable bipartisan effort on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, we have a Democratic minority and a Republican majority here in the House, and we

Madam Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. This amendment both would protect transgender in the sense of people who have had sex change operations, and would not allow the public to be forced to do so for religious reasons without the permission of their doctor and without the law actually being enforced. I think it makes it much better for the purpose we want it to be done and just really make sure we do everything we can to make sure we do things in a fashion that no matter what anybody else does, no matter how much people want it to be the case that this debate is, nobody is forced to have sex change operations. I am looking forward to hearing from our side, having a lot of folks on the other side of the aisle that are trying to make sure that we will not make it worse than it already is.

To talk about placing the McFarland in a museum is another reason that we should not be doing that because the President indicated that in the State of the Union address he was going to require the private sector to do the restoration work. He did not rule out having the Corps of Engineers out and doing it by itself. It is a fair thing to have a private citizen saying, ``Yes, you're going to have a job.'' What was stated by President Reagan and other Presidents about the Corps of Engineers was the Federal Government is going to do it; it is the private sector. They are going to do it right now.

It has been a week since we have had an opportunity to look at these bills because it yields you no opportunity to deal with the substance of the issue that this House needs to deal with, and that is coming together in a bipartisan way to get a balanced budget by the year 2002.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

body floor committee

As the gentleman knows, the Committee on Ways and Means has reported a bill out, H.R. 2896, the American Jobs Creation Act. This was reported out on May 25 of last year, and it is committee proposal that calls for a tax cut of $250 to $300 billion and that would be the floor under the condition that it be paid for with a tax increase of one-half of 1 percent on every person in this body. The present proposal is about $200 billion.  I heard the gentleman on the other side say that we have to spend more. I would simply ask the gentleman, since you've been on this issue from the day that you were elected in 1976, since then, of what you've seen to that date of time, the expiration of the PATRIOT Act and the whole base bill from 1976 through today?

provisions women protections 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4970, the House Majority's version of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012, which eliminates important protections for women from domestic abuse and ensures that these protections only apply to certain types of domestic abuse. This legislation would strip the provisions of this bill that protect vulnerable women from being violated in their homes.  I oppose this bill because it goes too far in imposing unreasonable limits on Federal law enforcement agents' ability to investigate and prosecute crimes against women. Moreover, in repealing important protections for women from being sexually assaulted, this bill would legitimize domestic violence against women. The vague language used in this legislation in reference to ``domestic violence'' creates a circumstance in which law enforcement agents are put in jeopardy of not doing their job, leaving women to suffer violent crimes. Furthermore, because this bill allows domestic violence in the context of other crimes, it is virtually impossible to prosecute domestic violence by any other means.

Mr. President. 6 years ago this month, more than 100,000 Bahrainis of all ages and backgrounds joined together to protest their government. Although these men and women were not engaged in military action, Bahraini civil society had taken a stand. It had come to the aid of the people of Bahrain by demonstrating peacefully against corruption and political repression and by calling on their government to fully comply with its international obligations. Although this demonstration did not result in the overthrow of a democratically elected President, its impact was felt throughout Bahrain.  The Bahraini people have suffered a loss of liberty in the past 6 years, and more than 2,000 of their leaders have been arrested or have been detained for political persecution. They deserve the government that they have.  There are a lot of things in this bill I have great concerns about. A number of issues have been deleted because they are in the name of a formula instead of something more responsible.  First, the

tax years version 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I have for many years now supported a line-item veto that can help to wipe out wasteful special-interest spending items that are added to the tax package that we are debating today. In 1993 and 1994 alone there have been more than $25 billion of overreaching spending in the tax bill in years past, a sum which is due in no small part to the opposition of the President and House Republicans. If this Congress does not act this year to strip this provision from the final version of the tax bill, it is my belief that it will continue to spend millions more in the coming years.  Last year I joined my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation to grant such a line-item veto to the President. Our original proposal would have waived the President's veto on any item not approved in the Senate spending bill unless the spending amendment contained a specific spending authority to pay for the item. Our House-passed substitute provided that the

No hearings; no hearings on potential abuses of taxpayer money. We have that for every President.

Some estimates say that between 50 and 60 percent of the population of the capital of Port-au-Prince has been displaced and most communities have little or no access to water, food, and sewer. The country is now recovering from years of marginalization and isolation, and independent journalists have been among the most able to document the human impact of this disaster. An estimated 3,800 survivors of the quake fled Haiti as early as August 2007, with many arriving at Port-au-Prince through the Haitian National Coast Guard's processing station.

The Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Health and Safety, David Lauriski, was the general manager of the Mine Safety and Health Administration until his retirement in May of this year. He must be informed that his employment is in serious jeopardy. Accordingly I ask the gentleman from Ohio if he is correct that the appropriations language on the pending substitute amendment would have the effect of removing the administration of administering the Eximbank program from the Secretary of Labor, thereby closing a gap in the program that I have been raising for many years.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, and I will say to the gentleman from New York, I will not object, but I want to express the continuing concern of the delegation of my State that they continue to receive billions and billions of dollars in aid from the Federal Government and that they continue to be held hostage to what is essentially a very difficult issue for them and that they have offered no additional amendments to this bill on which we should have an amendment provision. I wanted to state this on the House floor today, because it is truly my understanding that the majority leader is going to try to lay down his amendment because it seems to be a reasonable effort to get this matter out. So I hope that at some point in time the House will consider this amendment, and I certainly will not object.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 3415, the temporary gas tax repeal, election year opportunism that will do virtually nothing to help the taxpayers and create more job opportunities. The gas tax bill yesterday fell 3 cents below the last time it was passed. This is the 11th year this bill has fallen 3 cents below last year as the House Speaker has recently said gas tax relief will not hit the highway trust fund until January 1, at which time, as the House majority leader has said, the highway trust fund will be vulnerable to large cuts. That is an ill-advised promise in light of the fact that at that point the highway trust fund will be $151 billion at the end of this year.  My constituents, Mr. Speaker, deserve better than what they got last year. Last year gasoline prices increased by 6 cents, 4 cents below last year's average. Let us put our differences aside and focus on producing jobs and

If the gentleman would yield, the death tax that he referred to is even important to agriculture in a State such as mine. It is important to the gentleman from Arizona in terms of his point of view and the gentleman from Georgia in terms of his consideration of his views on agriculture in the State of Georgia. I think it is appropriate that they passed this initiative in this Congress to have a debate on the issue of the death tax and why it is an important part of the farm bill in the future. The gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from Arizona have a different view on it than I do on this garden tax as I am sure they do in all of their respective districts. But they do have an interest in it. There has been substantial movement, with the passage of this farm bill, in that direction, I think in a noncontroversial fashion in the last 2 years that it has been sent to the President of the United States

Mr. Speaker, sometimes, a tragedy has to happen for us to recognize unsung heroes. On Monday, I received word that Lowell Ensel had passed away.  Born in 1912 in El Dorado County in south Georgia, when he was just 5 years old, Lowell became a well-known member of the University of Georgia football team in 1927 when he became the first player to win a national championship since the first Undergraduate All-American in the history of our sport in 1935. He was an all-state selection and all- tragedy.  When Lowell took over the Georgia Southern Eagles as the head coach in 1928, he used a first-time speaker system. When Lowell's team lost, he walked out of the room. He used this as a motivation and as a way to win games.  His unyielding commitment to football would lead to his 5th national championship and he went on to be named the winningest head coach in the country

Now I have heard from over 600 small business owners, and they have stated to me that the most pressing issue in their minds right now is whether or not this bill will pass. If the Small Business Committee passes it, I think we can pass it and take that piece of legislation on to the Senate, and we will let the Senate work its will to change this law and create jobs for small business

Over the last half-century the President has been willing to go to the nuclear arms race and once again when confronted with the nuclear weapons threat that comes with it has been willing to get the best deal for the American taxpayer on every single time.  But the thing that makes the administration's decision so incredible is that for half a century it has decided that for every risk a country takes, when the United States commits an enormous risk to the world, it should be asked by others to pay the greatest price. You would think at this point in the history of mankind that that type of commitment would not be seen as such a priority. And it is a fact that as tensions increase and the nuclear threats grow, this administration believes that we have already met the challenge and its massive expenditure of funds for nuclear deterrence

So we are going to continue to get tax breaks for families in this country who earn over $100,000 a year and pass the bill on to our children and grandchildren without the issue of whether those families have the resources that are needed to actually spend it on the programs that they debate so much about when we are doing what they do.  It does not matter what is in the legislation; it does not matter who is in power. It will all add up to a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of the people in this country, and this is why the Republicans want to have this debate.

You cannot give that retroactive immunity to anyone who files a frivolous claim with the court that is innocent until proven guilty.

The House is back in session this week, and at the top of the agenda is health care. I am here to make sure that the Affordable Care Act remains law and that there is not one drop of it left in the insurance industry because the bottom line for the insurance industry is if you are on the exchange today and you make the top 1 percent of income and the top 10 percent make over $200,000 a year, we will be paying you a $3 billion tax increase this year on the next year in the sale of the exchange next session. I hope this House will hold hearings on that, and I hope that they will reject the idea of moving the marketplace out of this area.  I am here to speak about an issue of significant importance to me, and I am speaking about A, the Finance Committee, which I chair, and B, the Ways and Means Committee. The Ways and Means Committee is in charge

If the Senator will yield, that is correct. Not only did I ask that, but the chairman of the committee asked that, and it was accepted without controversy by both Senator McConnell and Senator Byrd. I simply want to make it clear that the goal of this act is to provide the Department of Defense with information that will be useful to determine what it is the appropriate level of force would be necessary to meet an emergency situation that might occur here in the United States of America without foreign forces being involved in that.  I believe that this is the most important agency in the Department of Defense to monitor and report on whether military force may be necessary in times of emergency, and I hope that when we give this new authority to the Department of Defense to do so, we would not be subject to some argument about whether or not that is a correct allocation of limited resources.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. H.R. 3858, originally sponsored by Representative Lantos of California and Representative Shays of Connecticut, would provide for the expansion of the I-35W U.S.-Canadian border by shortening the road from Toms River to Port-Royal by 10 miles and extend service to those who live in the floodplain areas along the riverbank and on its shoreline to emergency roads and bridges within that region. This bill is also identical to legislation originally introduced by Representative Tiahrt of New Mexico and Representative Gonzalez of California and which was also considered in the House of Representatives on June 25 and June 27 of this year and is household name in southwestern California.  As you may recall, in February, 2003, I testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding the need to expand service to my constituents in the San Joaquin Valley of California, and my testimony sparked a process that included outreach, meetings

Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.  On September 3, 2001, three men were found guilty of beating and shooting two women in their downtown Atlanta apartment for allegedly being gay and mentally retarded. Crimes motivated by race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability or national origin are routinely covered by State and local governments, as are crimes motivated by bigotry toward members of a particular race, religion, color, sexual orientation, ethnicity or disability.  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law

Madam Speaker, I would like to commend Virginia's Governor McAuliffe and Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe and all the Virginians who have fought to secure our elections.

We must find ways to meet the needs of future generations without sacrificing an already limited amount of land for tax-supported development or that such a balanced approach would place added burden on the Nation's struggling schools and universities.  I think it is also important to point out that the impact of this amendment would not just be a fiscal impact, but would be on the Bangor, Wisc, Concordia, and local economies. We need to expand public awareness, get involved in the planning process and seek out all options available to us to ensure that our local school systems and local communities have the resources they need to make sure that the children in those schools have the educational and employment opportunities they need to succeed in the 21st century. I believe this amendment is the only reasonable way to ensure that the full benefits of this program are realized.

The issue is we need to do this.  Now, people who have been on the editorial boards in the newspapers about the financial crises of this country probably can't remember it better than I can, I have to admit, because it was a referendum for a better tax system, lower taxes, higher revenue, a better investment to be made by American families.

ban great fracking

Mr. Speaker, one of the most absurd and destructive plans being touted by out-of-touch socialists is a ban on fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, to help our great Nation combat global warming.  As if fracking was not in the air by now, President Obama announced last month that he will ban oil and natural gas production in ANWR if Congress fails to pass the bill the House and Senate passed last fall.  Gas and oil production in ANWR today is roughly 1 million barrels a day, making it the third largest in the world. This is an increase of over 700 percent since the days when there was no oil production in ANWR.  Recent estimates also show that the fracking in ANWR will increase the carbon dioxide emissions from the oil and gas industry by more than 7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. How in the world can anybody believe that this massive amount of carbon dioxide pollution will be completely cleaned up by some supposedly governmental force when

Mr. President, in November 1948--that was 1 year after my birth--President Harry Truman issued a highly controversial Executive Order. It called for beginning the process of the end of the 20th century and for the establishment of the new and progressive age of the American people who had served this country so well in so many ways. The President said he wanted to make the age of the American people a time in which the people of this country were given the opportunity for success in the years ahead, a time in which ``our children can in their turn be the generation which reaps the benefits of our service to our Nation.''  For this Executive Order and its many gateskeeper instructions, for this Executive Order and its many laws, we now have four major provisions, three of which are still in force, and the fourth is called the Kindred Spirit, and as I will discuss briefly, this spirit has evolved into a storm of political embarrassment--pun intended--

The provision on land conveyance relating to the parcel of land in question that I will refer to here is the least controversial of the two items. This has to do with the ability of the Air Force to add to the items of land on it that are not included in the land parcel already conveyed to the Oklahoma Oil and Gas and Smelter Division under the terms of the settlement agreement between the U.S. Government and the property holders that were desecrated at Pueblo Service, Inc.

I would say to the gentleman that we are clear here on the issue of unfunded mandates. We have provisions in here that we think will actually help the States that are trying to have some of these funds come into them and they want to have a more effective way of doing it than some of the Federal agencies do it now with people who are trying to get the funds through and not get them through the Federal Government so they can take them out to the States to try to help them to make the kind of reforms that we think would help improve the effort to give welfare recipients a strong incentive to get off of welfare.  We do not think that that is in the best interest of the States as to how much of these funds are sent to them.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 657 to honor the contributions of Catholic schools. Catholic schools provide students with a wonderful education that the Catholic school system should be proud of. Every year millions of children of the American children of the Catholic school system receive the leadership role of their education in higher education by working on projects that benefit the community and their community members and developing education as a cultural part of their educational experience. Catholic schools provide great contributions to our society and we should provide the resources and opportunities that students and teachers need to advance their education. The Catholic School Improvement Act of 1995 will make more Catholic education available for all of our students.  I am especially pleased with the proposal that the House passed in our Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Committee yesterday to increase the maximum Pell grant level to $4,000 from the current maximum of $2,500.

Madam Speaker, last month, Republicans voted to end Medicare. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, their plan would raise seniors' health care costs by more than $2 trillion by the year 2026 without bringing the Nation more affordable health care. And these are my Republican friends. That is why they are not in this Chamber today to take up health care reform that will have real health care for seniors in our communities. Instead, they are standing in the corner and pretending that ObamaCare doesn't exist. This is just an attempt to deflect from the fact that their Republican colleagues have prevented health care from being available to anyone in this country.  It is time for the same treatment for the health care providers in our communities. It is time to end this unfair practice of having the insurance companies refuse to cover Medicare and provide no Federal guarantee. It is time for them to help our seniors, not harm them.  Now is the time for the American people

Chairman Wellstone and the other members of our leadership on both sides of the aisle have really come to the Congress with a very clear agenda that is in every sense a very new and different view of the way we should go about this business of business and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of trying to get these measures through the legislative process with minimal delay.

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3348 demonstrates the lasting impact of the blizzard of 1996 when cities throughout the northeast were faced with unprecedented snow removal costs. The cost of cleaning up sites of snow and mud can be over $300,000 per square foot when city budgets are tight and the Federal Government is unable to adequately help. The local departments of water and power, local hazard mitigation agencies, and Federal Emergency Management Agency public works programs respond aggressively to assist in the cleanup and make a difference in lower costs for the cleanup.  But FEMA and Wittman have no money to help the State of Maine, which has the most severe long-term effects, as evidenced by the meltdown at the Collinsville office complex.  With this bill, our Congress has a greater respect for the hard work of local governments and the efforts of their citizens to help restore the health of their communities, their good and their property.

The accumulated choices of Congresses and Senate Republican leaders will help ensure our Nation benefits from the benefit of its tax policies and Medicare savings. And that is what this legislation does. It does so without adding to the deficit. It does so without adding to the debt. The simple truth is that Congress should be spending less time passing legislation item by item and spending more time balancing our Federal budget.  This agreement, negotiated behind closed doors by the White House, with the senior Senate staff, House and Senate Democratic leaders, gives us the opportunity to vote for balanced budgets across the board, but it gives us the ability to let the American people vote on that, without having one more partisan wrangle over their names on a promise from a previous administration, in response to hearings in the House or in the Senate.

It is so important that this is passed and it is done so that we are not going to be subjected to that moment of heartbreak.

living bill government 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support this bill, H.R. 2920. I rise because there are many Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck, dollar to dollar at the Federal Government in some cases having little or no benefit from Social Security benefits they have worked hard to accumulate for their children and for themselves for decades. There is an amendment in this bill which provides that Social Security benefits would not be subject to this so-called `` living check,'' according to today's Department of Treasury regulations, and every dollar of income coming in to the Social Security trust fund, along with any personal property earnings, of course, is subject to taxes. That is the sad truth about the system. It really is unbelievable.  We cannot forget that we are in this position because Social Security earnings from retirees are taxed on every dollar they earn, and the Social Security trust fund is growing by a whopping $140 billion a year. So on top of that there is an

Mr. President, a lot of the motions we have heard and will hear, although very important to individual Senators and maybe even important to some Members of the House of Representatives, has to do with the call for a congressional commission to investigate why this program for America is so effective in getting to crime and then what would be done to reform it to make it less effective in providing resources to local law enforcement agencies. These are important questions that are being raised by many Senators and they have to do with measures taken over the years in the bill before us, which provisions have gone through and penalties have been imposed.  But the President does not want a commission. He did not get a commission when he was President. What he was doing was raising the specter that somehow somebody might disagree with him, maybe be critical of him, or that somehow we were doing something he wanted done, and we had a commission to look at the proper circumstances that

They brought back to Washington their air of authority and a commitment to the vision and values of this Nation, but also carried on their commitment to the workings of the Broadcasting Board of Governors and, in particular, of the corporation's two television broadcast boards.

Madam President, as I said it is a question of how much do you cut everything and keep it in proportion. I pointed out that you are certainly not going to make real economic reform unless you increase spending for defense and for Government. But there is also a debate here on the spending side and where the money ought to be spent. And that is where President Clinton made a difference in 1995 with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that provided for spending cuts in all programs except energy research and development.  We increased the amount for energy research and development by $9 billion over 1995, for example. We increased the amount for VA by $1.1 billion, while cutting by 50 percent the amounts for the rest of DOD. This is real spending reductions.  So I wish we had not increased the appropriation level for VA in 1993 from $48 billion to $60 billion--I should say the same level for Social Security, and

Madam Chair, as we prepare to take up an important piece of legislation today, H.R. 2021, I would like to yield such time as he may consume to the committee chairman, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks).  Mr. MEEKS. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this important legislation to increase resources for the State Children's Health Insurance Program and reduce the out-of-pocket costs of million-dollar medical liability claims for uninsured children. I applaud Chairman Coble's efforts to focus on this effort and to highlight the funding disparity between the Federal government and States. This bill addresses one of the most pervasive barriers in this country to caring for our children: the often punitive out-of-pocket costs that parents must pay for medical liability claims. My home State of New York has now become the first in the country to enact an individual child first law, OR

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, the leader time has been reserved, and the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 534, the solid waste disposal bill. We will continue to make progress on this bill and hope to have an agreement to complete action on it as early as possible tomorrow morning. That will be the President's priority. If we have agreement on time agreements, I will announce when we will be able to reach a time agreement. I want our colleagues to understand we expect that we will be able to solidify an agreement for sometime on Wednesday, so we may be able to stay on the bill for that time and then begin to work on other appropriations bills and other issues that have Alaska Senators on them.  I thank the Chair.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman who just spoke, my friend from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), and the gentleman from California (Mr. Beilenson), the chairman of our committee for helping us bring this legislation to the floor today and for their help in working to ensure that Federal grants can help restore these areas to their more equitable and needed status. I want to take a few minutes to discuss how the American people could help restore these areas to their better quality and to improve these people's lives, to make them more productive workers and, indeed, to improve their living standards.  In the late seventies, of course, people knew about the fact that HUD wanted to purchase and build housing in these areas to improve the lives of these displaced persons, primarily low-income and minority, but also elderly, disabled, and disabled-rookie population

incomplete texas today 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in reluctant support of this measure, asking for its approval, because without it, the State will not be able to clear the National Flood Insurance Program for the next 3 years at the current cost of only about $8 million today and in the future $9.5 million. If it is not passed now, the State will have to spend about $10 million to complete the new law as it is incomplete now, and then the Federal Government will not be able to guarantee State flood insurance in Texas or anybody else in the Nation. This is a needless and unfair price for a program that does not cost anyone a cent more than it was last year.  So I support the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The President will brief the bipartisan group of Senators on what is going on in Afghanistan. It is a report that has been completed. I am hopeful that a better understanding will be given to the Senate and to the House when the President issues this report to this Senate. I was just looking at the Senate amendments to S. 744. There are provisions that make the Senate bill the law of the land for the first time. Senator Hatch is working on a different bill, but there are a few problems on his bill. So we have a lot of work that needs to be done in this room with a lot of respect to the changes in law that have been put in place and the report that has been sent over to the Senate, a few amendments, and then we go to conference.  We will see how that goes and see what happens. We have other very important issues coming before us, in many ways even more important than

birthday today rural 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say happy birthday to the United States Department of Agriculture, which celebrated its 150th birthday on May 15. In just 2 months I would like to celebrate birthday of the Agriculture Department of the United States Government, the first Congress that did not have the ability to extend the statute of limitations for the most well known and in fact most important of all Government programs in the United States today; that is, the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development loan program.  One of the main reasons why I believe that I will not be able to continue my career in agriculture if I serve in this body in the next Congress is because of the overly generous provision in the Farm Credit and Rural Investment Act that was passed in 1988 which encouraged the expansion of a program which has been dealing with rural problems.  Under this program, in this area called Urban Agriculture research, we use the funds from the General Fund to make, quote unquote

injustice dead congress 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, we do a grave injustice today because this statute applies to American citizens as well as everybody else. Fred Korematsu was a U.S. citizen who committed the greatest injustice in the history of the United States to people who were American citizens. They were killed when Japanese Americans were killed by the Government of the United States of America when Congress and the White House felt it was in their interest to do so. They are dead. In Japan we have every right and the right to look them in the eye and have the memories of the Japanese American population. The things that the statute was designed to do and the history of this period is laid out in the Record of the Senate just last week. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] and I have been working for a year on the bill.  Last year the Parliamentarians of the House of Representatives amended the statute to remove the English language requirement in the case of the

Also, I must say it is regrettable that the objection was heard on the earlier unanimous-consent request for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in this area. I had hoped to have had the opportunity to discuss this with the distinguished chairman on a number of occasions and was more than willing to make that kind of an offer if we were able to get the agreement on July 28 on July 29 on June 26 when the American people sent a strong message that this is a crisis and that it is in the interest of the United States to have some agreement on April 15. That is the other basis on which we were able to get agreement last year for a favorable vote on this balanced budget agreement which could have yielded gains to this country.  I must also say that I know my good friend, Senator Santorum from Pennsylvania, who has been outspoken on many occasions on this subject, took some exception to the comment that this is a government takeover. Well, he has always said

Mr. Speaker, I have enormous respect for the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and for the sincerity of his purpose in bringing forward legislation today. And I will say this to the chairman of the Rules Committee today, his request of $50 million in research and $50 million for prevention seems a morally noble and sensible choice.  But let me also say, and he said it eloquently, that when the subcommittee's subcommittee chairman, Mr. Nadler, on which the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) is a member, had a blue ribbon committee back in the 1980's that passed $70 million in pork barrel projects that would have fallen within his district's budget limit, so the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle) and I agree on that, that is where we have differences. I am not exactly the anti-Pork Rowch; but when we had this attempt to kill pork barrel research, I feel that we
