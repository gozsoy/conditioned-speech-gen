The most recent youth tobacco use survey found that 17 percent of high school students were now regularly smoking cigarettes. The number of high school students who smoke daily increased from 16 percent in 1992 to 22 percent in 1994.  The problem with the current policy is that it has allowed youth to use tobacco products that are in the high-risk category. The tobacco industry has been a major part of the problem. The industry now profits from the sale of these products.  If this bill were to become law, it would be extremely difficult to control youth tobacco use.

This is the largest single transfer of Federal funds since the Marshall plan of 1944.  Now, the Marshall plan was $1.3 billion.  Now, we are going to spend $1.2 billion more on this $1.3 billion debt increase.  It seems like there is a natural instinct that if we spend more money, it is the end of the world.

Here we are today, 6 months after the last bailout, and there is still no congressional oversight of the billions of dollars in bailout money that was given to Wall Street. There is no oversight of the new trade deals that have been approved by this administration that will increase our trade deficit with China by over $70 billion. There is no oversight of the enormous amounts of money being given to the companies that did not pay any taxes and no oversight of the huge profits being made by these very same companies.

Mr. President I know what Speaker House knew before they put the controversial $300 billion omnibus spending bill on the floor, that we were going to have some amendments, and it is pretty clear what the bill is going to be. It is a disgrace that we are not able to get an agreement on this omnibus spending bill to keep the Government running.  We need to pass the clean continuing resolution that would keep the Government open, that will provide funding to keep the Government going and we will be able to keep the Government running. That is what the American people want us to do. They want us to keep the Government running. They want us

Mr. Speaker colleagues legislation properly titled the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 would reduce our reliance on foreign oil by reducing our dependence on foreign oil.  For those who believe the United States should be the world's only energy producer, this legislation is a step in the right direction. We should all be committed to reducing our reliance on foreign oil.  However, I am deeply troubled by a provision in this legislation that would direct the Department of Energy to prepare a report on the risks of importing foreign oil from overseas.  While the bill clearly lays out a plan for developing an alternative energy economy, it also directs the Department of Energy to begin the process

Over 6,000 people were killed and 1.6 million Haitians lost their homes. Many of these were men, women, and children.  In an effort to assist the survivors, the United States Congress established the Haitian Relief and Reconstruction Fund in October of 2003. In order to administer this important program, the President signed into law a supplemental appropriations bill which provided $15.3 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to carry out the relief and reconstruction efforts in Haiti.

The bill before us is a step in the right direction, but I believe it does more harm than good. This bill allows for the Federal Government to control the elections.  This bill allows for the Federal Government to impose arbitrary time limits on the electronic voting process. This bill allows for the Federal Government to deny American citizens the right to vote. This bill allows for the Federal Government to block, or close down, the Federal Election Commission.  I think it is a terrible mistake. I think we need to vote against this bill.

Mr. Speaker American market too uncomfortable with the fat cats. But do not be fooled. The Republicans are doing everything they can to protect and preserve their corporate subsidies for the fat cats.  One example is the corporate tax break that they want to give to oil companies. ExxonMobil alone gets a $1 billion tax break, and a $2 billion tax break for the rest of the top 20 oil companies.  ExxonMobil is getting $2 billion in corporate tax breaks, and $1 billion in the dividend tax break. Who does that mean to American consumers?

Oil is the primary fuel used by American manufacturing, which accounts for more than 60 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product.

I think that people, at least as I know, do not think of veterans as the old people who have to go into service in Vietnam and get lost.

I am sure we are thinking about how many people we have lost in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I am sure we are thinking about the children who are now being sent into that country with no parents. We are thinking about the seniors who are losing the money they paid

There are now nearly 20 million acres of public lands that are wildernesses, and in every State there are hundreds of thousands of acres of undeveloped land that are wilderness. However, a number of States have managed wilderness lands for years and have identified specific wilderness areas. In many cases, the designation of a
