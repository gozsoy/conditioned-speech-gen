No one could forget the heartbreaking moment as my wife and I watched my husband and three children being exposed to natural disasters. This one happened as he went to dump his house furnace.

If we look at the spending bills that passed the Senate last year and the massive budget request enacted by Trump and congressional Republicans, spending for Medicaid rose 10 percent between fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2017 for the issuance of contracts to treat care. Costs for treating it rose 16 percent between fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017, so the total is much higher than the 5 percent cut Trump touted during his budget speech in January.
