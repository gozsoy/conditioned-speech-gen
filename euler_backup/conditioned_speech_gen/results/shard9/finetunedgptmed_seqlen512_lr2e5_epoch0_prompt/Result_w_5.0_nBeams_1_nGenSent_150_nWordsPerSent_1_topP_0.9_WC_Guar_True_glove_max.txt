Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee if the Defense Department has received any specific information about the amount of money it has been asked to spend for the program in this particular appropriations bill that the gentleman has just made in reference to the P-3 and the programs that we have the opportunity now to examine so that we can come up with that amount that really is needed so that it is not going directly to military operations that we have in this country but rather to what are we trying to do to change that fact and bring forth some efficiencies and put that money back into the resources and into the programs for these vehicles, capabilities that will not be there for the future if we do not have an appropriate effort in the country to deliver these weapons to the troops at the right time.

These are public lands management activities such as no-take rule to ``walk'' off of those and our use of grazing in some of those areas.  In the last fiscal year we saw the worst erosion of public lands on record. Many of the managed areas have been unable to consume enough water, and they are nearly dry. Millions of acres of public land are now covered with dead vegetation and offal piles and erosion is threatening to tear this landscape apart. When we consider that about 2.6 million acres of public land will be affected in this year alone, it is clear that this year's dramatic erosion and the

We believe that $40 million and $50 million is not as much as the $25 million minimum we have in the bill that we are offering in this amendment today to increase the percent of income that goes for the families of four for whom such a threshold is also set.

According to ancient Greek scholar Polybius, they came to the region to seek refuge from the long encroachment of the Roman empire upon their ancient Greek homeland and to observe a kind of ``pure state of freedom.''  The Greek independence was also a liberation from bitter and bloody centuries of servitude which forced them to work hard and expend their lives to protect their land. In fact, according to the ancient historian Aristotle, Greek writers glorified the Greeks for their independence and freedom because it freed them from being deprived of their traditional cultural heritage by barbarians who, once they arrived, would take that culture and their culture and

In addition to the firearms, the men were carrying around several illegal drugs. The agents were unable to get them off the truck and tried to get them back on but were stopped by drug dealers inside the truck. The drug dealers in the truck fired at the men who were trying to cross.

There is a reality that China is in a state of market expansion. This bill builds on the intelligence and counterintelligence capabilities to strengthen our intelligence network. In addition, it will strengthen U.S. countertrade law, legislation to sanction unfair trade practices and, again, protect our companies and workers by improving labor, environmental, and consumer safety standards.

Specifically, the amendment will do two things. First, it would allow employees to recover more money if they are injured and they can claim their time back and it would ensure that when the employees get their time back they get their money back in the next period.

But we also also want to make sure that our future leaders have the support that they need to do that job because we will be the key to putting our economy on a more sustainable course so we will reduce cost growth, decrease the need for government.  It is clear that we have a lot of good jobs in this country. I think we have a lot of good jobs for the next generation, and we do need to help Americans know that we will pay for them. That is why this bill is important to help advance the U.S. Senate in the same way that we helped advance the House.

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Inhofe, I propose an amendment that would place a 10-percent border tax on certain personal home mortgage loans. As Senator Inhofe correctly pointed out, the current form of the legislation doesn't ensure that any such tax would be collected. Furthermore, the financial institutions that accept these loans, can provide the lender with an additional incentive to be responsible for the costs associated with the high interest rate mortgages in their portfolio.  Our amendment would make it impossible for lenders to make such high-interest rate mortgage loans to people not legally in the United States. This amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, to the extent possible, to impose an additional tax on such mortgage loans. This is a necessary provision in order to effectively tax all home mortgages and facilitate the repayment of these loans.  On

But I do so with reservation about the provision in the report that increases taxes on farmers by $1,500 per year. With that clarification, I would like to be able to explain why this particular provision should be rejected by the President and the Congress of the United States and will accompany a unanimous consent request on the budget resolution.  One is the unprecedented level of taxation contained in this legislation. This increase was levied as part of the defense discretionary spending bill. This tax cut will provide only a modest $34 billion to meet the military requirements, and that number is only partially offset by the $19 billion provided for the Department of Energy and the $10

Then we see another example of how to use our federal resources in a bipartisan fashion to promote the preservation of this and the aviation system and highways so that we don't have to deal with a situation where you only have money for some projects; you don't have money for the entire airplane that

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the House Committee on Science amendment. The House Energy and Commerce Committee has offered several bills to reform energy policy, including bipartisan energy efficiency bills which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Kasich] sponsored in the House on a bipartisan basis. These bills yield numerous benefits to the United States as well as other countries in the world. A strong and competitive Texas economy will be in danger of going to a state that is Iowa or to a state that is Oregon or whatever, and that is exactly what is happening. It is sending the wrong message in every way. The people who live in the northern half of the country will see their paychecks go up, their power bills go up, their home energy bills go up, their taxes go up,

Lithuania has always been an important ally of the United States, as it has been for generations. Lithuania has always been a strong nation to be counted on in Europe. Lithuania has made its contribution to European security while providing economic stability in Europe and Greece.  From the beginning of World War II in 1939 to 1943, Lithuania fought in the Communist war machine, the Warsaw Pact, against the Soviet Union and Soviet Orthodox Patriarchate. It is the former-Soviet Republic of Lithuania that remains firmly committed to democracy and fundamental values.

This is one of the most important bills in the history of this House because it will finally bring the full force of our Government show on again, hold Wall Street accountable, and establish a watchdog for these huge corporations.  First, Mr. Speaker, let me explain how this legislation came to be.  First, as everybody knows, today's House of Representatives has a majority of the jurisdiction, and we are the ones that deal with the Government. We sit on that floor and get up

Mr. Speaker, almost exactly a year ago, when the Trump administration came into office and took power in the White House after having been led and then controlled by people who have had very little experience in the country of the people and yet have had a long-time interest in the country and a long-time interest in what has been going on here since the time they came into office has already been one year ago in January, so I take it that that has not changed much in the last year and a half.  But the funding that has to be provided to pay loan guaranty agencies is $420 billion that is needed. And I think that if we move along on the legislation today, if we allow the appropriations process to be run the way it has been ran for a year, that that $420 billion is going to be

We need to ask the same question about the Americans who now pay $35,000 to take this fight to Washington.  The Federal Government owns the Green Bay Packers, and if they shut down for a week, the taxpayers of Wisconsin would receive at least $7,000 in benefits under H.R. 28.

Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago this week, Speaker Gingrich and the Republican leadership presented a plan to balance the budget in 7 years and pay for it with tax cuts for the rich. That plan was a $400 billion tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans yielding a $2 trillion deficit over 7 years, $100 billion a year later. That plan failed on an appropriations subcommittee by a vote of 17 to 0.  It failed on the House floor, and Speaker Gingrich and the Republicans refused to listen to the American people.  But what did Speaker Gingrich offer on the Senate floor in an effort to restore his reputation and his credibility in this election season?

In June of 1997 the President asked the Department of Housing and Urban Development to increase its spending percent for homeless services by 25 percent, a number to be close to the percentage of eligible families. We did not think this was a radical idea, and we thought it would increase participation in a program where this very thing occurs.

Madam President, the high cost of gasoline has had a crippling effect on the economy as a whole and the local governments of Pennsylvania and the Nation in many of the high-cost States have seen the costs of gasoline increase far beyond the cost of their roads and highways. The state of Ohio and Alabama have been particularly hit hard by the high costs of gasoline because farmers and fishermen from those States rely on lower prices to get their products from the Mississippi River into the gulf coast. The price of gasoline has been tremendously high for farmers and fishermen, especially in my home State of Michigan where the costs of fuel are high because the refiners in Michigan and Kentucky have raised their prices higher than the refiners in Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama, and the price of gasoline has not kept pace with these increases in the cost of our refinery and our

Unfortunately, House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have not yet brought up this issue with their own body, and if they had done so, they would have won that battle.  Yet House Democrats are waiting. We've never had a chance to bring up the debt limit extension yet. Their inability to pass the unfunded mandates bill or provide for a full debate on a responsible budget resolution threatens to derail that very important piece of legislation, in order to pay for yet another massive tax increase for America's wealthiest Americans.

It had just been over 20 years since the last year when the member and the sponsor of this amendment would have been able to get to the floor and they would have been able to have one last vote before the last day in August when they would have been last year before months of months of weeks of spending bills are not in place. The Senator from Utah and I on that bill were able to get to the floor. And, of course, the Federal Government is now in the position of actually not providing any funding for the arts.

Under the bill in question, the State of Michigan would be allowed to acquire the proceeds of the sale of each convicted sex offender under the Massachusetts Township Compact Agreement. The State would then sell these proceeds to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which would then decide which sex offenders are eligible for release. That is a real concern.

Such involvement by any European NATO forces will be to reinforce European Europe's wrongheaded policies in Central and Eastern Europe and will inevitably cause serious consequences for our own interests and our allies' interests there. This reservations are shared with many of my Republican colleagues as well as by virtually all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle. Many people understand very well that profound and deeply negative consequences could be caused by U.S. military involvement in Europe. In fact, there is very good reason to believe that such military involvement is likely to lead to further and potentially more serious consequences for the United States and our interests in Europe.

The House Republican tax bill makes big improvements to the corporate tax code but only $40 billion. We do not have any idea whether, if the leadership does not put out a plan to pay for the tax cut, we are going to continue to expand the capital gains rate to the highest in history, because if we do not increase

The original act provided taxpayers with the ability to adjust their health care costs based on the rate of inflation.

Our bill recognizes that the private prisons are out of control and that they are becoming the public place where the President and the Clinton administration have brought forth this model prison system.  The underlying bill actually calls for a permanent transition of the private prisons in the United States to contract out to civilian and State correctional agencies. I agree with the general premise in terms of the executive branch coming in and admitting they have not cleaned up the private prisons, not one facility that they have cleaned up has run afoul of Federal law.

I would like to just make sure that I understood the amendment that was accepted by the committee and also that the amendment by the majority leader was accepted by the Senate. The Senate had amendments to their amendment that would have cut Federal assistance to States for lack of health care insurance for families who do not have health insurance through the Federal Government to the extent of spending this Federal money on programs Congress could not finance without congressional approval. The Republican majority has rejected that amendment and the Senate has accepted the majority leader's amendment that the Justice Department could not cover at a reasonable cost because that is the purpose of this. That is the reason the two amendments are accepted by the committee, and we are in agreement on that.  So I would like to thank the majority leader. I would

I say there are certain rules but there are rules and regulations placed on land all across the land but there is nothing for it in this place to interfere with regulations. This is an amendment that will allow regulations and restrictions which is specifically approved by the Rules Committee to be set in effect under the existing land law with that landowner. The only thing it does is it will permit landowner to purchase and sell at least one acre of land.  Now, it is probably not the fault of every landowner on every parcel, but this is going to help them as they would like to be able to be active participants in land management in this country. The property owner will be able to buy and sell as much as he wants.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I was pleased when Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Ryan worked out an agreement in which the House could override a provision that we were told did not allow for prompt transfer of such advanced weapons systems for combat purposes. There is no cause for such concern, because it does not include moving such dangerous advanced systems before we face the terrorists or risk their capture by Iraqi and Syrian jihadi forces.

I was in an appropriations meeting today.

I did not get to see the reports that have been made of this increasing rates of frivolous lawsuits.  We do need to move forward. The President is right. We need to move forward. The frivolous lawsuits are not decreasing. It is increasing. We need to have more enforcement of the Fiduciary Rule, and we need to make sure that families have their day in court and their day out in court.  I believe the President supports the Fiduciary Rule. Let me look at this President's budget

He and I could be very close to finishing up that matter tonight and then begin the debate on health care for our Nation. We want to get moving quickly so that as soon as we are able to move acting on this legislation, we can begin the debate on the health care legislation and vote on it shortly after we complete that legislation and move on to the health care bill and give it all the time we need to work on it.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, if I might take a moment, I believe we want to first dispose of the question about how we are going to vote because we want to finish this very very thing just before we leave the floor for the week of July 7 and maybe something else that we might call this one. But we are going to do it on this matter because we want to get that issue resolved to this point that we might not even have to come back here again to ask Members what they think of this bill because we know that there is no reason for a unanimous consent agreement. We all know that and understand it.  There is no reasonable way to do this bill. No reasonable way. In fact, no reasonable way in my judgment. So, I would ask that we proceed as we have agreed to and send to the desk a bill

As to this amendment, on March 23, Senator Byrd rose and said: ``...the war in Iraq is nothing more than the first step in this mission that no one doubts is going to be very difficult but that no one will consent to to be reversed by any agreement that any other nation has come to in that kind of a situation.'' So it seems to me that is essentially what this is all about. So this is not a war that our troops need or that the American people need because it is not that way we have always been doing this kind of thing because this is not what that is all about that this is not what that fact out there in the newspapers, the people in the world outside this country seem to believe this is about.

This plan has two parts. One is actually an attack on the middle class. I have talked to my constituents and people in rural communities who are frightened by the proposal, the brunt of which will be to those middle class people who have been paying the cost of these tax cuts which, as Senator Harkin has pointed out, will mean billions

The program provides emergency emergency emergency fuel stockpile insurance for Federal firefighters and first responders who can't pay for it themselves. But it is also used to help families in need in developing nations, who lack adequate emergency fuel assistance.  Since 9/11, the Defense Department has authorized a new security-wide program to train and equip spouses and children of military personnel that then send them home for care and rehabilitation.

direct united investment 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, today, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would promote trade and investment in America's manufacturing and technology sector and would provide States with a greater investment in programs that support small businesses and States that are important to American workers to expand the United States' manufacturing and technology economy.  The commercial agricultural sector is the key to America's future. The United States is the world leader in international trade and a direct competitor in the world market. Some of the United States' most successful companies and manufacturers have chosen to locate their operations in the United States, citing jobs and economic security as their main reasons. Increasing domestic exports has helped create more than 42,000 high-paying jobs, and an estimated $250 billion in new direct and indirect exports from the United States and our allies have positively impacted the global economy.  This bipartisan bill would increase

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, in 2010, I was here and voted for the Affordable Care Act. It passed the House with about 71 votes in opposition to change it. However, I have now changed my mind and want to offer my support for the insurance reform bill that the Senate is currently considering and oppose a previous vote that I opposed. This bill is a step in the right direction and I cannot and will not back away from my support for this bill and my father's legacy of health care reform.  First, while the bill does not fix the problem of private insurance companies losing billions of dollars in ObamaCare subsidies, it is a start in the right direction. The most important component of this bill is a small tax credit for individuals purchasing employer-based health care coverage. This bill helps people with low incomes and in rural areas get health care, while

In its 1979 amendment to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, the Congress considered procedures to provide order to these proceedings in pre-trial detention, and to provide that pre-trial or post-conviction proceedings, as appropriate, be conducted in the best interest of the prisoner and the family, because these proceedings provide a fair opportunity for

Madam President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, U.S. Army 1LT Mark A. Hill of Clarksville, Tennessee. I want to especially pay tribute to those who have lost loved ones and the families they have touched while they have been serving their country in the National Guard and the Military Police of the United States Army. They have all died in service to this great Nation that we all know so well and are so proud of all they have done for all people.  When Mark graduated from Mississippi State University in 2004, he was ordained into the Baptist Church and began his career at the National Guard Center in Humble, Tennessee. When he left, his family moved to Tennessee. He met two of his college professors while they were working in his family's home, and they are still with us.  All the while, Mark's

Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey and my colleague from Delaware for this legislation. It has been a bipartisan effort in the committee, but one I commend.  This bill is essential to not only the health of our country but also to the safety of our veterans. The VA requires private-sector companies to share information with DHS and the FBI on TSA screeners who may screen TSA baggage. TSA has Mueller-style requirements for details on individual screeners, but the Department of Homeland Security must provide TSA with additional information--legally--for TSA to make a judgment on whether a screening is illegal. This bill will help TSA do the right thing and allow all companies--not just TSA--to better share the information on screeners, not just DHS, and not just to provide them with a chance to correct the

Mr. President, today the Senate begins in earnest our efforts to determine if our colleagues on the other side of the aisle understand what it means to have not only majority support, but majority support for a bill that would protect Medicare from going bankrupt and that would put a price on those seniors with private plans or against private plans that deny them needed coverage because they cannot justify the cost. And I believe the answer is clear, and that is to support the bill before us today that does the job for the American people that the arguments that were made before testimony is given will simply not hold true today because all we are doing is beginning debate over the earnestness of the arguments and the substantive positions of our side of the aisle.  I think we have a chance, though, to do that in today's special order. There are Democrats,

It would simply involve a change of direction on a loan, the Army stating that it is ready to serve a new loan, but it is clear the administration is not going to provide any direction on that.

If this amendment passes today, it will be very substantive.

Mr. President, this amendment is not new to this Senate. We have considered it several times before in the past to try to increase the Federal Government spending for our children and grandchildren. We have found that it does not work and we have come to the conclusion that America can never balance its budget by increasing the Federal Government spending because that will only force that spending to increase more and more in coming years.  There are two ways we can do that to pay for higher taxes and increases in Federal spending employers. We can either cut the employees' salaries or raise their taxes or both. I think the Senate has chosen to take a more direct route. I say direct because most taxpayers are not professional employees. They are simply tax payers. Most Americans who receive a paycheck are an employee of a small business, the sole payer of those

This amendment is in keeping with my view that the rise in the number of Members of Congress is not due to new national profile or to new congressional hearings or committees, but because new, younger, and more eager Senators are demanding more responsibilities, more scrutiny, and less deference from older and wiser Members of Congress. At a time when many American leaders must resort to their ills--when personal challenges become more pressing--the new generation of new Senators has demanded more attention and attention demands more accountability.

Mr. Chairman, as a father of a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old, I got to tell you it really was a shame that the funding was reduced in this bill to make sure we could continue that public-private partnership and put Americans back to work on the job they want to do today and tomorrow morning and so that our children do not have to rely on desperate hunger.  I can tell you that I know how hard my friends on the other side of the aisle work to keep food on the table. I have heard it said that people cannot support a government program if the whole Government is cut off. This is so unfair and I believe it will only impact those who really want to be helped by those who do not have the funds to pay for this program.  It is so disappointing to hear that we are cutting funding to this important

Senator McConnell and Senator Grassley have worked tirelessly in a bipartisan way to take a very big step in Vermont and around the country to implement a national program that we know works, but does not do this. It is called it direct grant programs.  This legislation simply expands what currently exists in Vermont.  In Vermont, we have many cooperative opportunities. We have a number of companies and community groups which benefit from these grants. At the same time, we also have a number of a student loan marketplace businesses which are in which we will

Speaker Gingrich must tell the American people, every single time he goes out and condemns violence and mayhem, he starts it again.

And I think it is also important that we continue to address discrimination because the lives of so many families across the Nation are impacted by decisions made in the private sector or in the public sector.

Mr. President, if convicted of another serious crime and ordered to serve the time served, if the defendant has been recommended for parole, if the defendant has recently turned in his or her criminal history report to the police, or if the defendant's last known address does not match the address of a parent or legal guardian of the defendant, the defendant is considered innocent until proven guilty and convicted of a different offense.

Instead, the amendment proposes that abortion clinics be forced to continue to deny women the right to choose whether to have abortion or pay for abortion services that would oppose the woman's decision to have it. This amendment is morally perverse and inhumane and is inconsistent with what our constitutional system is all about and what we stand for and what our clarity is about.

In fact, many people today with only a couple of small businesses in their own home counties in this country have incomes that will make them pay the equivalent of $6,000 to $7,000 in taxes and their taxes in total. That is an amount that probably comes down to $1,000 to $2,000 a year.

I am sure our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would never imagine this moment to be so close to their own historical memory and not act at the time as we should have. Yet they chose to act with such shortsighted and shortsighted policies that they would damage the safety of our Armed Forces and the bill that the President signed in July of this year represents some of the worst failures of the Bush administration ever in terms of the most recent events in the so-called war on terror observed by our Nation.  The bill I am about to introduce would end the so-called terrorist screening in the Armed Forces. It could change the character of this military and put our military personnel in an uncomfortable situation and will not achieve our goals of a

Mr. Chairman, in today's education environment, we are facing a competitive world. We are faced with educators who are learning on the fly, having never had the opportunity to go through the classroom before, facing difficult and unpredictable assessments, as they grapple with more and more curriculum.

higher federal bill 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, for many women and their families, higher health care costs means the difference between paying for a health care plan that will cover their primary care bills and having to pay higher premiums for the prescription drugs that they need to stay healthy. That is the message that I heard as the House of Representatives considered legislation that would expand Federal funding for community health centers and transition to insurance and Federal programs that will cover community health centers.  This week the House of Representatives finally adopted legislation that would permanently extend important government funding for the expansion of the Community Health Centers Fund--but only if Congress could agree on a funding mechanism that would include matching funds from other Federal programs. While this is an important step in the right direction, it would still leave behind thousands of community health center funding opportunities that need to be reallocated to other programs.

For the past year, the Sustainable Growth and Job Creation for America Act, more commonly known as SGRMA was a compromise that would have repealed the health yield tax.  During the reconciliation process, I worked closely with the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Young], the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell], and my dear friend Mr. Meek to remove Mrs. Eleanor Holmes Norton Madame Norton's health yield tax from the SGRMA legislation.

That solution is to maintain current diplomatic and military presence at sea. It is, after all, the primary role of the United States Navy, which is vital to maintaining international peace and stability.

This is about the fact that we need background checks in our lives to be able to keep our family and our loved ones and our place of business from being compromised by bad actors or those that are in our memory creating, processing or distributing terrorist materials.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, it is all in this Nation's best interest to support this measure. This is a wise decision to support this bill, not only because of the effect it will have on

It has a fair repeal of the President's line-item veto petition, which now it may never get, because it violates the line-item veto, but it does not change the President's line-item veto of the very people who have it.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Despite congressional control of the agenda and the will of the American people, that is the Democratic leadership's legacy from their 2004-2008 re-election campaign, notwithstanding any effect on the legislation.

feeling america president 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, there is a justifiable feeling of anger and worry across America today regarding America's desire to tax corporations and to do it fast and to take it away from small business. President Bush has said he is going to do this because he thinks it is good for the economy and we should go after corporate America because they are taking too much of our money and doing things we do not want them to do but we feel it is our patriotic duty to take what is theirs and give it to America.  I support tax incentives for small business and believe they can help grow our economy, but at the same time, there is an obligation to make sure small business maintains the ability to raise taxes and to do so for a stable and growing economy. So I am asking the President to consider bringing new funding to the Small Business Administration,

This bill builds on the tremendous efforts in this body to renew the important health care programs such as HIV epidemic prevention, Family Planning Services, maternal, newborn, and child health and educational support for all, sexual and reproductive health, child care and education, rural health services, and supplemental nutrition programs.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, for more than 10 years in Congress I fought for Americans to own up to their choices in purchasing health care insurance policies that would provide choice and support when they bought the insurance policies in the private sector. Congress and the amendment would reverse this and other efforts to protect a certain new company from competition and consumer protection in America through a Federal program called the `` york plan.'' The amendment would allow this competition and consumer protection to provide health care companies with a Federal funding source to grow their markets, increase prices, and support higher quality health care.  Mr. Chairman, the No. 1 goal of this Government program is to insure insurance plans that cost more, have fewer benefits, and discriminate against the American consumer. And a private health insurance company is going to have to

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this noncontroversial bill. We are concurring in the Hoyer-Reed-Day support. We want to be clear that the bill before us today is not designed to be a tax increase and it does not give the government more money to do the work of public health and safety.  What it does is simply block the DOE from issuing any new loan guarantees to Nebraska and South Dakota that exceed 100 percent for the first 3 years. The current loan guarantee program expires at the end of the fiscal year.  This bill does not mandate that lenders of the disaster relief bonds repay the dollars as they have borrowed. This bill simply ensures that the loans made by the private sector are approved by Congress.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Reed-Day-Hoyer-Reed

If you are going to offer something, come to the floor and discuss it and put it out there for the benefit of all the Members and not refer to the pending pending amendment which we know will not come to the floor any time soon because it is very long and we are not clear as to absence of jurisdiction.

Mr. President, a few years ago President Obama gave a speech in Miami where he made a plea to Congress to enact the Paycheck Fairness Act to improve the safety and fairness of federal workers. He proposed increasing the minimum wage and extending unemployment insurance to over a million workers by the end of this year. It would be the law of the land to apply these to all workers, not just a select few.  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the House Democrats on the Federal Labor Committee refused to accept the President's proposal. Congress should, therefore, pass this bill and let it become law. The bill passed the House by a strong bipartisan vote of 355 to 9 in December of last year. Unfortunately, that bill was not enacted into law.  The Federal Labor Department has set up a task force to look at ways to increase

As I said yesterday at 12:40 p.m., he was more than 60 percent of the way through the day on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. I have been working around here with his staff and with the people we have known on Transportation and Infrastructure and the roads. They have told me that he can speak, and it would be appropriate for Senator McCain to speak during the course of this debate.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It is important that we adopt the Republican budget that offers a realistic alternative to the current $4.2 trillion national debt which is not only putting this country in a financial hole but also putting our Nation's economy at risk for the generations to come as we will be forced to place additional important tax cuts and take other new spending cuts for America's children.  The Democratic budget does have some elements of this, which will help, but it also includes other elements that are off the table, and it does support our soldiers and their families with the tremendous savings that they will enjoy in a health care system that supports their families.

public federal government 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act (H.R. 310). Like the federal Government's failure to protect public decency on television, this bill does not provide for the deployment of law enforcement in the television industry.  Right now, public indecency can be committed on television. The laws in effect for indecent or obscene material include, but are not limited to, indecency on books, films, and video games; and in most cases, public indecency may be banned on broadcast media.  Although this bill provides that those with indecency on television may be arrested for violating the law, it provides nothing in the way of wiretaps. In other words, any law enforcement officials that may want to work with the television industry to crack down on these networks will have no ability to help public indecency artists on the networks

Mr. Speaker, I rise with regrets, acknowledging H.R. 3008, a bill to close the Federal Government down for this winter and put the Nation back in the spring time.  The report goes on to say that it ``would allow the Government to continue operating without appropriations until June 1 and the Secretary to make operating decisions for the remainder of the fiscal year.  ``Therefore, the bill would have caused fiscal year 1997, which ended on December 31, 1997, to commence without an appropriation and in effect with no funding authorized for fiscal year 1998.''  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, the Government will remain closed and so I call for a ``yes'' vote on the H.R. 3008, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and the end of the Clinton Administration's policy of being in the summer season instead of the winter season

Since July 1997 we have had the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on our country and the pain that it caused to those who were still under the effects of that initial attack. Today, September 11, is an important day for us to pay our respects and to remember the crude and barbaric terrorism that was perpetrated against our Nation.  As you may know, I have one concern with this bill. If you care about minimizing the risk that something like that could happen again, then the wording that is included here in this bill is flawed.

On July 1 of this year Congress will vote to cut some $800 million in crop research research funding for the Federal Government through this agency directorate for cancer and critical agriculture research. Congress needs to act now to cut some of this $800 million and leave much better investment to other federal agencies like the chairman just spoke about.  It is a shame that we are even spending $800 million on a program that has not been cost-effective or that has not been an airline for the farmers in this country.

I assume that the gentleman is aware that the Clinton-Gephardt bill proposes $7 billion in spending cuts over the next 7 years for Medicare Part D program hospitals which is Medicare for hospitals that have closed and if we do not do what we are proposing in the bill today with the cuts in Medicaid we will lose even more health care for those hospitals.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Final sequence: 

I thank the gentleman. I think it is a mischaracterization to say that we cut the overall numbers and just call them cut. It does not cut because it is not going to happen in a time of substantial deficit reduction. This point is very important to all of us because we are talking about providing the jobs in America that will allow those workers to have that kind of opportunity to become majority and actually create jobs.   Apparently, I think this gentleman is too quick to embrace the president's tax cut proposal and the tax-cut cuts, but then after the tax cut ends, there will be $800 billion or $900 billion in tax cuts that the American people cannot even imagine because the budget agreement we had tonight is essentially to decrease the deficit by $400 billion, half of the budget agreement.  That budget deal would reduce

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, let's not complicate things. There is nothing in the transportation bill or the bill before us that prevents a highway from building a bridge across the border. In fact, the bill makes it in law to provide that. And that is all we are asking for here today is a reasonable process for where we are building a bridge across the border as we have had with the housing bill.  I don't believe we are doing anything illegal, and the issue is not whether or not we are building a bridge across the border. I don't think we need to. What we are saying is, what is the right way to get to the people who want to help our country? We need to put these questions to the President. We need to explain how we are going to deal with the people.  We need to go through

Mr. President, Senators' bipartisan discussions continued all day yesterday and through the night. Both sides' bill has been approved by the Senate with amendment No. 254 now the only thing holding up the bill, however the bill should still be brought to the floor because that may allow us to come to some compromise that does not give Americans the number one Federal health care program they have for 20 years. Both sides have been working all day to come to some compromise so that families and small businesses that are part of the individual market would have coverage and the elderly could get paid up to the same amount as Americans with private health insurance. There is also a proposal to provide tax incentives to keep small businesses affordable. I understand the Senator from Minnesota is concerned about some provisions in the bill that prohibit deductibility of tuition. Senator Domenici and I have worked on

Mr. President, this week, I have the honor of recognizing Hannah Nieskens of Jefferson County, Idaho, for a lifetime of service to the public. Hannah is the first American to lead a group of Montana native American women from both the land and the water to build the Nation's first public school in Jefferson County, Idaho, in 1953. This is a wonderful example of American history that has both the promise of a better future and the reach of American citizenship in the United States.  Hannah grew up on Hermitage, MT, in a humble but caring family. She was raised by her maternal grandmother in the Lewis County refugee camp, where the next generation of Hermitage's brave Americans learned to take on the burden of world and country. Hannah earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Montana in 1959, received her master's

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 162 will reduce the value of an old woman's crop in an Indian community by about $6.50 a year to a family of four in just one year because of the Government failure to address the yield loss from the consumption of the local fish as well as the other economic and social problems associated with this American Indian community in Alaska and North American states. This would mean significant child poverty in many villages. It would be devastating to the local economy and would have a chilling effect on families in the area.  Under current law, the Government has been asking for changes in the Indian Status Act in order to address these situations and was able to obtain one such change with respect to the Alaska Village Purchasing Program. Under that same agreement, the sellers have been

Mr. Speaker, last October I thought that it was absolutely necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein. But since that time President Bush and his first Secretary of State have absolutely deluded the American people and the world by providing the military and political cover necessary to allow the brutal and ineffective regime in Iraq to continue its relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing in the Iraqi cities and towns of that nation which is now known as the State of the World resort.  As I said at the time, I think those who support an invasion of Iraq are underestimating the ability of Saddam Hussein's regime to do what it so desires--to continue its brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing. But I am not suggesting the United States should remain completely passive while this regime continues its relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing.  It was this same regime that led to the U.S. invasion of

This School Lunch Program is a great example of how these congressional priorities are actually working, to the benefit of our kids and to our grandparents.

The reason why this study came out that came out the way that it did was that the question that we wanted answers to was, in fact, looking at different groups of people.

A couple of weeks ago, a bill came up that was so balanced, to be exact, that it looked like, if I remember correctly, only a few Republican Members voted against the bill. What is interesting is that some voucherizers want to take a piece of that balanced, balanced bill and move it onto their own charter schools that use charter schools and then ask for tax breaks and lobbying.  So I think a high school student knows that it is a very important question of balancing the budget, and now is not the time. The facts are there are students who are eligible to go to high schools

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to another hard-working member of the Committee on Rules, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters).  Ms. WATERS. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding me this time and I would like to say a few words in his place in the body for my colleague from Utah [Mr. Begay].  The continuing resolution before the House is the most important piece of legislation that this body is considering and it is a direct result of the fact that the city of Green Bay has recognized their debt to the United States of America. That city of Green Bay owes us a portion of its debt to the United States of America because they were literally in a time of war, which is the time we recognized that we needed to do something to help the families, and Green Bay has come forward

sides forward president 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, if I may respond, I think the approach that we get into the discussions with our friends in the other body is one we can agree to. We all agree to that approach which is also at the end of the President's first budget resolution and our proposal is with respect to the pay forward issues that are in the President's proposal. If we agree to that approach and then we move to the full conference and then we continue with that process and not have our sides over here representing differing views, I think we can find a way.  If we do not agree to that, let us set up that next year. We can agree, if we have an agreement as well, to a reduction in PAYGO by $150 million. That would require us to come to conference and meet that very, very important issue and

chinese real freedom 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi], for her rational view on this amendment and for her leadership in this area and in this Congress and indeed in the United States Congress when we deal with real and serious issues such as the inclusion of women in the workforce.  And this amendment is in the right context and really in the right spirit and ought to be passed for the good of the Chinese people and the good of the United States. It is the right thing to do because freedom in the United States requires not only public education but, most importantly, freedom to earn your own way and make your own life.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

units bill housing 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce an amendment that I think fixes a provision of the bill that allows service providers to drop within a school district housing units that are designated as eligible for the program.  This is a little bit unusual for the school districts of my State. We are not very traditional in the use of the dollar-by-dollar language that is used by the Federal Government in school districts, and my good friend from Texas mentioned an appropriation issue because, as he said, if we do not include the dollars, there would not be the appropriations for the school district. So, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment and I will work with my colleague from Texas to bring it up.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, maybe we can resolve this. I have had some conversations with the chairman. But I do not believe that would resolve this.  The gentlewoman from Texas is under a commitment that she cannot talk until the evening, is there some reason why the majority leader cannot talk with the Republican leader until after 2 in the morning and 4 in the morning before the vote on the microphone?   Nos. 1 and 2 is going to take some time on this side of the aisle and some time on the Republican side of the aisle as well and we have to be on the record as soon as Carolina comes out of the voting.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

states health risk 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, this Member rises this evening to speak about the urgent need for a robust health care system for all Americans. Americans with serious medical conditions face skyrocketing health care costs that are out of control and are going to increase even more in the future if the United States continues down the path of increasing our Government spending on health care. If we do not do something now we risk the very things that we promised to do after we passed the Affordable Care Act.  Mr. Speaker, the Affordable Care Act was supposed to be a job creator for this country. It was supposed to create new jobs, lead to greater economic growth and stability, and create a level playing field for all Americans to compete in a highly competitive marketplace where health care is the No. 1 issue in the minds of Americans. The same, of course,

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere condolences to the family of Chief Judge Michael John Bender of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judge Bender had tragically passed away on Wednesday, June 19, 2016, and was immediately followed by Chief Judge Robin Owens on Friday, June 21.  Chief Judge Bender had served for 22 years in the condolences services of his church, Jesus Christ United Methodist Church. I personally met Chief Judge Bender's wife, Ann Cahn, many years ago at his funeral.  As an attorney for over 30 years, Judge Bender's unyielding commitment to and dedication to his clients has been evident throughout his judicial career. He was known as a person who was sincere, open, courteous and always cooperative.  In 2018, Chief Judge Bender was reelected to the Ninth

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Barton and Ranking Member Hyde for the effort that they have put into the American people and for the hard work that they have done in the International Relations Committee. Mr. Speaker, we need to move in this new direction of more consultation on behalf of our foreign policy and relations in Asia. Taiwan should not be treated as an economic observer at the United Nations or as a neighbor to the United States. Taiwan will be forced to become more responsible for its own defense activities.  As you know, Taiwan has been the victim of acts of aggression by China for the last few years, not through agreements, but through coercion. And the Taiwan Relations Act will remove the threat of Taiwan becoming an economic-outline observer and will give this nation of

los angeles chairman 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman and Members, today I rise again in strong opposition to this bill. I had not planned to speak on this legislation, but the chairman just made me realize that most Americans do not understand that this bill would lead to the disestablishment of the Department of Veterans Affairs and, as a result, the Department of Defense will have to be in Los Angeles when they move their headquarters back to Washington, DC, which would then prevent this needed restructuring to protect veterans.  Mr. Chairman, many of us have experienced the terrible pain our wounded veterans and their families have endured over the last 2 decades. This legislation ignores and seeks to replace the status quo with a commission of 20 individuals appointed by Congress to determine the long-term fiscal health and security of the Department.  Mr. Chairman, the Constitution prohibits congressional committees from establishing a commission
