It is time for a change in Medicare, and the Republicans have offered a new Medicare plan that is not better, but worse.  We have heard about the fact that the Republican plan will cost seniors more, will cut Medicare more, and will deny health care to seniors. The Republicans have said that they will cover more children, but only in Medicaid.  They have said that they will protect the senior, but not the disabled, but they

And the American people have seen a dramatic increase in personal savings.

cases federal judges 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President Federal judges have cases where they are not exactly up to speed on the rule of law. They are almost always given 10 years or more to explain their reasoning. I have a problem with that. But it is not an emergency situation. It is a case where there is a statutory requirement that we have a trial of a case. It is a case where the standard is clear that it is inappropriate to give the judges a large portion of the time that they need to make their decision. That is why I offered an amendment to the Budget Act that I have worked on with Senator Hutchison.  That amendment requires that the judge give 60 days

The Peterson-Chabot amendment says that if we want to keep our national security, our economic security, and our global energy security, we must invest in our clean energy future. Fossil fuel use is increasing, not decreasing, and the Peterson-Chabot amendment is a step in the right direction.

It will do nothing to improve worker safety, the health of their families, or their pension security.  There is a direct connection between unions and workers' lives. The Unions Act guarantees workers a right to organize, but it allows employers to fire workers, evict workers, or coerce them into forming a union. The right to organize does not exist for the sake of organizing.

Mr. Speaker, the Republican plan is the same plan that has a $4 trillion deficit and will bankrupt the country in 5 years. That is the Republican plan.

Mr. Speaker time and gentleman century have passed and the fight against crime in America has never been more urgent. The only way to stem the tide of crime is to focus on the most important question, what do we do to prevent crime?  We must break down the current impasse. We must pass legislation that will put more police on the streets and more criminals behind bars. We must strengthen the criminal justice system and eliminate all the disparities that are driving the crime rate up.

In order to keep energy prices low, Louisiana must be able to store a substantial amount of oil in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve. As a result, the State is dependent on imported oil, and will experience more refinery bankruptcies in the future if it cannot use oil from domestic sources.  I

This budget is a step forward in our efforts to secure our Nation and its interests around the world. It provides a substantial increase in military spending, but it also provides the resources necessary to maintain the peace, security, and stability of a strong and strong America.  This budget is the result of careful consideration by Members of this body and the committees of jurisdiction. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, I have made it a priority to review the defense budget to see where

Mr. Speaker people control school budgets, and the U.S. Congress is one of the largest single recipients of Federal student aid in the country.  The current situation is unacceptable, and we need to address it. That is why I introduced H.R. 1585, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act.  The act will allow schools to set discretionary spending limits on the amount of money they can borrow. In other words, a school could be required to borrow money from the Federal Government to fund the costs of its own students. The goal is to reduce Federal spending.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

Today, as the Nation mourns the loss of our country's finest, it is important to remember that there is no single national tragedy.

Mr. President President earlier this week National Public Radio reported recent efforts to reduce junk mail from radio stations in America. NPR and other news outlets in recent years have found themselves in the unfortunate position of receiving unwanted radio messages in the form of ``micropostal'' solicitations. In some cases, these solicitations are delivered to individuals with mental health problems or drug addiction. In other cases, the same junk mail is accompanied by unsubstantiated statements, such as health warnings, that claim that the sender is on the ``front lines of the war on drugs.''  There is no question that a healthy environment exists in America today, especially in rural communities

legislation speaker expense 

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker Speaker, legislation expense disclosures for Members of Congress should be disclosed to the public so that all Americans can judge for themselves whether or not they believe the actions of Members of Congress are in the best interest of the American people.  Unfortunately, the Democrats have decided to hide this important information from the American people. They have decided to hide it in a package of bills that they hope to pass this week.  Madam Speaker, the bill we are considering is a legislative waste of time. We should be focusing on jobs and the economy, not doing business as usual.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The Fund has provided retirement and health benefits to nearly 8,000 retirees since it was formed. The Fund's financial success is directly related to the successful policies of Governor Jim Edgar.  Illinois has a strong pension system. The state's pension fund has received over $16 billion in Federal and State grants and subsidies. Illinois also has a very strong working pension system. The Illinois Department of Labor administers a generous pension plan for the State's 12,000 public employees. Under the terms of the

The Ryan budget would have a significant negative impact on the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund.

This Nation is facing a crisis of inadequate resources that will be seen in future hurricanes. We must address this crisis in a comprehensive manner.  Hurricane Sandy brought down towers, destroyed power lines, and crippled our power grid. It was a direct result of inadequate

It is hard to believe that in an era of soaring unemployment, millions of Americans who are out of work and have not received any form of unemployment compensation are living on the edge of financial disaster. Yet, in this time of crisis, the Clinton administration and Congress have a responsibility to provide financial assistance to help these Americans.  Federal employees, and many of their families, do not have the ability to qualify for unemployment compensation because the program does not provide the means to pay benefits. So many
