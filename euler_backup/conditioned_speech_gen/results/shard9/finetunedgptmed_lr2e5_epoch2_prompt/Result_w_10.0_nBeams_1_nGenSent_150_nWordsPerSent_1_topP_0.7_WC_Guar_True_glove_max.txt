As has actually just been discussed by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Goodlatte] on the Memorial Day recess and also a timely reminder, this rule allows the House to consider H.R. 6331, the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act of 1995. This legislation, as we all know, would make several important changes in the veterans health care system, including providing a total of $500 million for increased medical education for returning veterans.  Mr. Speaker, the veterans health care system is in need of repair. Veterans in need of care have many needs, and many of them have received inadequate health care for decades. Unfortunately, many of the problems that we have today stem from a decades-long, very expensive, and often ineffective system. H.R. 6331

But I think that his career in the House of Representatives, his tenure in the Senate, his tenure as Governor of the State of Oklahoma, has been a career of constant interference and to the point that we are losing touch with reality.

But that number is far from certain, and I am a cosponsor of H.R. 2200, the Head Start for Children Act.

I am especially pleased that the conference report includes my amendment to increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25. The amendment is a sensible increase, providing a minimum wage of $4.75, equivalent to $8,500. My amendment will increase the purchasing power of workers, which is what is needed to support families and businesses. The increase in the minimum wage will help families pay the cost of buying

It will cost taxpayers a staggering $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years. In addition, this bill would dramatically increase the amount of debt we are subject to by another $1 trillion over the next 10 years.

Mr. President, I am honored to address the Senate in celebration of the 185th anniversary of the State of Israel and its founding as a Jewish state in 1948. Israel is a sovereign country and Greece, Cyprus, and Cyprus Orthodox churches are recognized as churches in the Orthodox Church Patriarchate of Constantinople.  On May 16, 1948, the democratically elected Government of Israel was proclaimed and the charter of the National Assembly was signed. On July 5, 1948, the third session of the first democratic elections of Israel took place, in which Mr. Gilad Regev, the prime minister, was elected to his second term. He served in that capacity until his death on October 16, 1996. The new democratic government, which assumed power in December 1948, held its first meeting on January 9, 1949, and its first election in May.

Mr. Speaker, I recently presented a joint statement with Senator Snowe regarding small business contracting reform and the Department of Defense Appropriations Conference report on Government Business in Government. The prime focus of the legislation Senator Snowe and I introduced was on the impact of contracting reform on small business.  Small business is one of the fastest growing segments of our economy. The sector has the potential to create millions of new jobs in the future. In order to maintain our Nation's competitiveness, the Nation must maintain an adequate level of contracting. This legislation will do just that. It will help small businesses provide their employees with quality and competitive contracting services. It will help retain existing employees, encourage the creation of new jobs, and make the Government more efficient.  It is no secret that contracting reform is vital to the success of the U.S. Government.

jurisdiction handle ahead 

Final sequence: 

As I have indicated or as has been indicated by the distinguished chairman, the subject matter jurisdiction of the subcommittee is the matter of foreign assistance and related matters dealing with the next round of United States negotiations on the START I START II Treaty ahead of the START I Treaty that will be coming up in the next couple of months. So it would not be appropriate to handle this matter, which we have some obligation to do, on the defense authorization bill.  I also will note that the Armed Services Committee, under the leadership of the chairman and ranking member, has jurisdiction over the military construction account, which is a large portion of the total defense budget of the United States of America. So I think we should accommodate that jurisdiction and not proceed to that particular measure that is before us, but I will continue to look for a way to move

This overriding action by the President is an important step toward reestablishing the proper relationship between the United States and the Nation's Latino community.  In my own district in San Diego, Latinos are an integral part of the community. They are very involved in local government and civic affairs, and I am sure they will be the same in my home State of California.  As my colleagues know, Latinos have played a key role in California's development, from the founding of our State to the election of its first Latino Senator in 1971.  My home State of California has had the largest Hispanic population growth in the Nation, and I am proud of

Now, I would be willing to accept the gentlewoman's request if we could get a specific amendment to provide for an expansion of the Medicaid program. But to cut $3 billion out of the child care tax credit and to cut $2 billion out of Medicaid and to put that money into a tax cut for millionaires and billionaires is a grave mistake.

In recent years, it has been plagued by a wide range of political, economic, social, and security challenges. It has struggled with foreign policy and security challenges that we all share.  Iran's military support for radical Islamic extremist groups and its support for Syria's Assad regime are a concern.

This bill will reduce the amount of DEA drug money that is now in the state and local law enforcement block grants and direct the money to other programs.  My bill is based on a series of principles that I believe are important to law enforcement.  The first principle is that the resources should not be diverted to activities that would further exacerbate our criminal justice system and could undermine the efforts of our law enforcement officers to keep us safe.  The second principle is that our law enforcement officers should not be subject to a selective application of scarce law enforcement resources that do not serve the specific purposes for which they are being

The President's decision was based on the statements that were made to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs last week by Secretary Timothy Geithner and Deputy Secretary Lawrence Summers.  I am pleased that the administration chose to stand behind this health care reform bill and its legislation that is supported by the administration and by the House of Representatives, and I thank the President and Secretary Geithner for their leadership.

Madam Speaker, the House of Representatives will never know another Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill. Tip was the House Republican Representative from Boston and, until his untimely death last year, was the most powerful person in this House. Tip served with distinction as the House majority leader from 1962 to 1967, when he was named to the Senate majority. Tip O'Neill was a man of the people, a man of principle, and a man of the Congress.  Tip O'Neill and I were friends from the time that we were elected to this House. We were both in our first term. I was the youngest Member, and he was the oldest. We were in the minority when Tip came to this House in 1962, and he went on to be a Member of this House for 22 years.  I will never forget Tip when he

It's not like we're talking about a new tax. This is a tax increase, but it was, in fact, in 1993.  So, in 1993, we had a new tax on energy. It was a 1.6 percent tax.

The balanced budget amendment is an important step toward achieving a balanced budget for the first time in 40 years. This measure will require the Defense Department to live within its means. We must cut spending and return to the President's budget baseline, which was enacted in 2001. The underlying bill before us is a first step toward achieving this objective.  In 2001, the Federal Government spent more than it raised in revenue. In 2003, the Federal Government will spend more than it raises in revenue. In fact, if we do not address the deficit and debt, by the year 2005, the deficit and debt will exceed the gross domestic product.  This amendment would restore fiscal responsibility to

Yes. The way the insurance premium caps would be is, I guess there is an answer to that, but I cannot give you the answer to that because we do not know how much money we recover from health care premiums and health care doctors because we do not have the information because we have not done a study yet. But if the doctors kidney or other health care expenses or other costs of treating patients that we receive from our colleagues are too high, we will have to either raise premiums or cut some other parts of the health care bill. That is what is going to happen. We will have to either raise premiums or cut some other parts of the health care bill.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my strong support for H.R. 1772, to authorize the Marsh migratory bird refuge.  Since it was established in 1976, the Marsh migratory bird refuge has worked to protect the endangered black-headed warbler and other threatened birds in the Southern Tier of the State of Florida.  The refuge's protection is not just a conservation measure; it is also a recreational destination, where families enjoy the bird's nesting sites and access to wildlife-watching areas.  H.R. 1772 will also help enhance the public's understanding of and appreciation for the Marsh's unique ecology and provide the foundation for future legislation.  I commend Chairman Dingell for working to include provisions in this legislation to support the Marsh's designation as a threatened and endangered species, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in

For example, the U.S. Information Agency has been very successful in developing an information system that is available worldwide, is readily available, and is reliable.

This bill will allow the private sector to do it in a manner that will not negatively affect the student loan program.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my bipartisan bill, H.R. 6168, the so-called ``Make It In America Now Act of 2015 to continue our economic growth here at home and here in the world today and in the future by increasing U.S. exports to foreign-made products to help Speaker Pelosi's budget and President Obama's jobs agenda.  Since I came to Congress, I have been working on this issue to make our country more competitive and to help create good-paying jobs here at home. We are creating good-paying jobs for American workers by boosting exports, and we need to be competitive.  Last year, I authored the Make It In America Jobs Act, which will help create millions of good-paying jobs by making the United States more competitive in the global economy. It will create more than

Mr. President, the Senator is correct in terms of the process. We still have a President of the United States who will finish the job on a regular basis. It is a matter of debate and discussion. We have had a vote on it before. The President, of course, is a Presidential candidate, so it is a matter of debate and discussion.  The Senator is correct that there will be a conference committee on a number of amendments that we will try to work out. It is not clear yet exactly what the exact schedule will be. But we are very hopeful that the conference committee will come to an agreement on these amendments. I know the Senator from West Virginia is anxious to have his amendment dealt with.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The contract was intended to give our military the ability to inspect, upgrade, and reassign the weapons of war at its disposal, without the fear of being subject to an imminent threat. In the face of such urgent circumstances, the Department of Defense had no choice but to undertake a program that did not have a good track record.

The language of this bill is a clear attack on the rights of prisoners of war, and I believe that this legislation is an egregious violation of the men and women in uniform who are willing to risk their lives for our freedom.  The National Commission on Prisoner of War Sexual Assault and the Commission on Women and Men in Prisoners of War have long been a voice for the voices of prisoners of war. While the commission is nonpartisan, its recommendation is always bipartisan. The Commission recommends that the Department of Defense take steps to ensure that its sexual assault policies are informed by the Department's commitment to promoting sexual safety and preventing

Traci's story is an important one because she was forced to leave her home because she was homeless. Traci, a mother of three, told us how she went from her apartment to her job as a nurse and then a teacher at a local high school, where she was surrounded by all of her peers.  The Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee hearing featured testimony from a HUD official and an urban affairs expert on New York City's homeless population. The official from HUD testified

The EPA recognizes that these are contaminants that are inherently incompatible with human health. Therefore, the provision eliminates them as exempt from regulation.  In addition, pursuant to the provision prohibiting circumventing environmental laws, there will be no more lease sales, no more cooperative leases, no more ``land sale,'' no more ``leased land'' permitting. These sites are the sole property owners. It is their property, and it is their property that they will sell.  So it is not a transfer of property. It is

Mr. Speaker, in 2010, I was here and voted for the Affordable Care Act. It passed by a huge margin in the House of Representatives and insurance companies could no longer be forced to keep people who have no health care and who cannot get it because they cannot afford it when they get sick or when they age out of the family because they father a job or are just trying to find a job. It's an amazing program.  It is still not affordable for a lot of people. There are over 27 million Americans without health insurance, but the problem is that, at the time the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, in order for a family to buy health insurance, the price of the health insurance they had would have to be $28,000 a year. They would have to have two people working for them. In some

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, on the floor this week I criticized the baggage-of-appearance problems surrounding the appointment of political appointees to the Governmental Affairs Committee by the administration in the floor debate on the ethics reform bill that we consider this week and criticized the Washington Post editorial page for a similar editorial that I read in the newspaper on Wednesday that criticized the President's effort to try to change the rules to get around this ethics process and also criticized the President's request to change the rules to have an ethics committee that would review ethics complaints filed against the President, the same rules that apply to the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, it is clear to me that there is a growing problem, an ethics complaint process that does not function. In fact, Mr. Speaker, the ethics complaint process that we are debating this week is in fact already taking too long.

Mr. Chairman, should America further weaken its national defense strategy by deploying our military to countries that are state sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East or elsewhere in the world and by nationalizing the oil industry, we will have the opportunity to achieve what the Framers of the Constitution intended.  The founding fathers intended the Federal Government to maintain the political independence of the people and to be a bulwark against the accumulation of powers in the hands of the federal government. That is why our Constitution grants Congress the authority to declare war and has been a vital part of our national security since the beginning.  Our Founding Fathers did not intend for the Federal Government to be a de facto foreign policy body. This is why the Constitution provides for the Framers' intent in section 8, which states that Congress shall have the sole power to raise and support

I particularly want to thank Senator Gorton for his tireless efforts in moving this bill to the floor in a timely fashion and his continued cooperation and leadership in securing an agreement to make some minor adjustments to the bill.  The Senate was given a clear and compelling case for reform in the District of Columbia, and I want to assure the House of Representatives that the District of Columbia's long-term fiscal stability is

address home energy 

Final sequence: 

Madam President, the issue of climate change is a pressing issue and so I wish to address this in a way that is as energy-inclusive as it can be and as real as it can be for home-based producers, farmers, ranchers, and entrepreneurs. I am speaking about the Energy Star program.  For more than a century, Energy Star has been an important part of the agricultural marketplace, particularly for producers and ranchers. This program provides $1.20 per gallon of gasoline and other petroleum products to farmers and ranchers who are purchasing renewable fuels.  The program allows producers and ranchers to use renewable fuels to meet their energy needs. For example, it allows producers to use their own biomass to create biomass-based fuels. It allows producers to use carbon capture technology to capture carbon dioxide and use it

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Before I begin, I want to state that I strongly support the State laws that prohibit discrimination based on genetic information. However, I believe that the State laws must not be forced upon the Federal Government and I am therefore introducing this legislation to make it easier for people to have their genetic information, whether they want it or not, protected.  The State laws are a step in the right direction and I am proud that they are a part of this legislation. However, it is clear that more work needs to be done. Genetic information is so complex and highly personalized that the government has not yet fully understood its value. We need to create an environment where genetic information is freely available to the general public so that we can continue to grow and learn from the many ways that genetic

In April of this year, the Committee on Rules refused to allow this resolution to be considered on the floor. This closed-door maneuver was clearly a political maneuver to obstruct the full measure. The Committee on Rules refused to allow the measure to be considered on the floor because they were afraid that it would make them look bad, as if they were hiding something.  The Committee on Rules, on the other hand, has done a magnificent job of shielding the Teamsters from the spotlight, but they have done a disservice to the people of California.  The Teamsters pay back their backpay, and they have already contributed millions of dollars to the California Highway Patrol and to other

The fact that the D-day landings were of such importance to the United States is one of the most important things about D-day. I think it is important to note that, as the Senator from New York said, there are many Americans who have a very close connection to D-day and who have a unique connection to the events of that day. There are so many people who know the men who landed at Normandy. I have two of them in my office right now. They both

Our Government's most basic responsibility is to provide the health care and benefits that keep our Nation safe.

Mr. President, there is a justifiable feeling of anger and worry across America today regarding President Bush's recent executive order that America will feel compelled to close down or, if not, eliminate its borders to illegal immigrants and illegal immigrants from any nation other than our own.  President Bush's executive order, issued last week, is a chilling reminder of what happens when the Federal Government ignores the American people's desire to control illegal immigration and make sure that illegal immigration doesn't touch our borders.  As the administration is trying to craft a plan for controlling illegal immigration, it is hard to understand why the American people are not being more informed and critical of this misguided and dangerous order.  Mr. President, the executive order is inhumane, and it is un-American. In fact, it is the exact opposite of what we should be

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Ryan White Reauthorization Act of 1995. This title of the 1996 farm bill is long overdue and is long overdue to be considered by the Senate. It is epidemic disease. It is the disease that will continue to ravage the American economy if we do not act to address it.  I was pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Hollings and Lugar, as we were engaged in a spirited debate on the Ryan White bill. In this debate, we discussed the future of the farm bill, and we laid out a vision for reform that would make the American farm economy and the American consumer healthier and more competitive. We made a good faith effort to find common ground, but we were unable to resolve any of the thorny issues that have kept us from bringing this bill to the floor.

That was not then, and it is not now, as the gentleman from Florida pointed out.  The law that we are now debating today, if we have a cost of living increase that is greater than the wage that was received in the last year, we would be required to pay that additional cost of living increase.

Their strategy of retreat, the escape from Tokyo Bay, was defeated.  For 3 years the Americans fought in support of the defenders. They rescued some of the Japanese prisoners, then, when it was clear the Japanese would not surrender, they turned their tanks and jets on the enemy. They chased the Japanese to the port of Saipan, and a strait was opened for the escape. The Doolittle

Hamas is not interested in peace, and the violence in Gaza is a direct result of their refusal to accept the borders established by the Israeli Government.''  The hosts of the show seem to be condoning and celebrating the Hamas' illegal invasion of Gaza.

For example, I worked with Chairman Howard Coble in developing the 1995 Homeland Security appropriations bill. He was an effective partner in this effort. The legislation was signed into law and, as a result, increased the Coast Guard's capability to deploy new detection equipment. The Coast Guard has spent over $2 billion on equipment in the past few years, but the amendment I introduced, which required the

One of those occasions has been my experience in the 1970s, when I first began to understand what the people of the Puget Sound and the many different cultures that surround them truly had to offer.  I would have to say that the day I first went to visit the Sea Grant Museum and take a tour of the Sea Grant museum was a day that I would never forget.

This resolution, in part, focuses on spending cuts to balance the budget. But I am especially pleased that this resolution provides $1.1 billion in savings to education. I would like to talk about that a little bit.  I have been working on this issue for some time. We have been at it for about a year and a half now.

Mr. President, in fact, we do this in every instance. In the first Congress, in the case of the Antiquities Act, we established that this is the first bill of Congress, and that this is the way we define national monuments, not the last Congress, not the first Congress. So we established a rule that we would have an up-or-down vote on national monuments.  That is a very simple rule.  Now, Mr. President, I think this is important for a number of

As the only staff member who has been living in the Senate for many years and who families have been there for many years, I have been working for many jobs in the past, but this has been the first time in my career that I have been absent from the Senate and working from home. I have done this in order to be able to attend the funeral of my father, my grandfather, and my great-grandfather. This was one of the last jobs I had, but I have done so because of a personal commitment to doing everything I can to assist the people of New Hampshire.

It is important that we adopt the Republican budget that offers important America-first tax relief to families and small businesses who are struggling today and generations to come. It is not enough to talk about the details. We need to act now to pass the bill that will bring relief to our hardworking families and businesses and that will provide them with a brighter future.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I submit for Members attention the following letter from myself and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board that was received today by the rule.  The letter follows: Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National Transportation Safety Board, I write to urge you to      support the Senate's position that the NTSB recommend      passage of H.R. 1637.       The NTSB's NTSB Recommendations section of its      final report for the Transportation Department budget states that       all proposed projects should be considered under the      most restrictive conditions and not approved if      the total project cost exceeds $1 billion.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act (H.R. 310). Like so many Federal Government agencies in the public interest, the FCC has made significant strides in its efforts to protect children from inappropriate, obscene, indecent, and violent material on television.  In recent years, the FCC has moved aggressively to implement television guidelines to require broadcasters to obtain parental consent before airing material on the air.  Unfortunately, even as we focus on ways to strengthen our efforts to ensure the safety of our children, we must also continue to vigorously enforce the Communications Decency Act.  In the FCC's rulemaking on the current format of television programming, the Commission determined that ``it is in the public interest to prohibit indecent, profane, and violent programming in all forms of the medium.''  By this, the Commission clearly is stating that

Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote by the chair and the ranking member of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee acting on behalf of the minority.  It would strike section 920 of the bill that prevents the administration from negotiating the privatization of the Medicare program. The Medicare Trust Fund currently holds more than $270 billion of private-sector assets and approximately $25 billion of Federal retiree accounts.  Section 920 is a perverse law that requires privatization of Medicare before it can be negotiated. The bill provides for a sunset on privatization, but the administration has made no attempt to negotiate the privatization of the Medicare program.  I believe that the Department of Health and Human Services should be the lead contractor on Medicare privatization. I urge the House to reject this amendment.  The CHAIRMAN. The

Mr. Speaker, last October I thought that it was absolutely necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein. President Bush should have done so a long time ago because we absolutely have to have the weapons of mass destruction in the region. But it is not in the interest of the country of Iraq to resort to the use of force to disarm Saddam Hussein.  The problem is that our country has been reluctant to act militarily in the region because we did not want to create the impression that we were threatening to use military force.

Mr. Speaker, time and time again, Americans have said that they want Congress to deal with the American people and America first and their schools first. The debate over school prayer is a political football. If one side is concerned about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the other side is talking about school prayer.  My Republican colleagues are speaking to this issue with ``gotcha'' questions and ``gotcha'' arguments. They have no business saying that it is wrong for school officials to say prayer in the classroom.  In Texas, Mr. Speaker, the Texas Supreme Court has ruled that Texas law protects the constitutional rights of school officials. Mr. Speaker, the House Republican majority is in the minority in this House, and they have lost the majority. The House Republican majority is asking us to adopt their agenda and to allow school officials

In the course of the negotiations between the administration and Congress, we have worked hard to establish a fair and equitable process for consolidating FAA functions and functions which have traditionally been performed by the FAA.  In light of the fact that the FAA has been operating at a very severe deficit, it is critically important that we not shortchange the FAA in its ongoing efforts to reform its structure. I believe

Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, maybe we can resolve this. I have had some conversations with the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Shaw], and he will resolve this with the Republican leadership on the Republican side of the aisle so that we can get it done in a reasonable time frame and that the microphone of the Republican leadership can be turned off so that we can get the record straight here and so that we can move on to the Carolina Panthers.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

los angeles chairman 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman and Members, today I rise again in strong opposition to this bill. I do so because this chairman is asking the public to put up with his and the chairman of the other committee for a $1 billion over-the-next 5 years Los Angeles infrastructure project.  This $1 billion is the largest single project in the Nation that will come out of the appropriation process. This is a massive $1 billion project, and yet, in the face of a $13 billion budget deficit, it is being put on the back burner and not even considered.  This $1 billion is the biggest project in the Nation, and yet the majority of the Members of this House who represent the Los Angeles area and have the responsibility to make sure that these projects get done will not even let the people of the area have a say in
