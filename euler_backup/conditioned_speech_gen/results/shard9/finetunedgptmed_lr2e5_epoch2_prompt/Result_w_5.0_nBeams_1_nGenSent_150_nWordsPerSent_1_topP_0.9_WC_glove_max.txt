I know the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has been very helpful in understanding that our Nation is well prepared for these important national security tests and that the importance of these so-called ``Monday in the New Year's playdates'' have really not gone unnoticed by the various agencies that are working on these security initiatives. What have you heard from the one that is our closest adversary in terms of testing those plays this year and doing these other activities so that they might be successful?

This church that has taught us, at one point in our history, made a difference and made a difference to be a proud community. Our community should not forget that the United Methodist Church has served not only the poor, the downtrodden and the sick, but our community as a whole.

Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the comments by the gentleman from California, but just so my colleagues know the schedule is not set for Thursday but rather for next week before we begin the August work period when we would make this time flexibility for the chairman and myself to work in a bipartisan way and also to have oversight on the Federal judgeship and the congressional inquiry process in the committees to make sure we solve the problems and make the committees in the Congress have the right answer to the problems that we confront with the judicial branch agencies that are our government agencies.  I have to say to the gentleman that all the issues that are brought to our attention by the Judicial Conference would come to our attention through the oversight process because the issues we bring to our attention are not just from Congress but they are issues that come from outside our government and involve

History is written by the victors and one must be faithful to one's oath. Unfortunately, the Congress failed to honor the oath to uphold the Constitution and the law of the land on that day when we permitted Greece to exercise its first free elections since 1821.  This is an assault on democracy. I continue to hear of corruption and political repression by the ruling parties in this country, but we have to remember that when people violate the laws of this Nation, they should face their violators not in a courtroom but on the street in American society because they should understand that there will be repercussions to their actions and actions will not stand unchallenged

The bill we are considering today has two goals in mind: to expand access to hunting opportunities for migratory birds and to increase conservation funds available to States, communities and hunters.  Hunting bird populations in non-Federal land has long been a tradition of southern California. The early settlers of San Francisco's Golden Gate valley established plentiful hunting areas around San Francisco and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. From hunting grounds located on Golden Gate Park's mountainside to the Golden Gate Zoo's bird sanctuary in Silicon Valley, California's hunt of birds have been a part of the daily lives of generations of Monterey Bay residents. Hunters from throughout the State enjoy the abundance of bird species for hunting, many of them migrating birds as they migrate inland

It is the right thing to do to provide for that which we call ``low-cost care.'' It would do that by providing for the non-Federal part of the cost of the premium and by limiting out-of-pocket expenses for any Medicare enrollee who finds that the family budget for medical care has been reduced in the year prior to the year in which the case is brought under the waiver. That is in the committee bill now being considered by the Senate today. So I am very happy to support this amendment and look forward to its passage in the very near future.

Madam President, this amendment would significantly improve upon the current section 635 of S. 343, the Agricultural Research Service of the Department of Agriculture Amendments Act of 2005. The current section 635 would provide for a study of the public availability of agricultural and related information about the subject matter of the research that the commission designees are to carry out in future years. The result of the study is a priority list that would recommend policies and funding for such research. This amendment would take those recommendations and make them law. This amendment would improve the efficiency of the Agricultural Research Service by creating additional opportunities for participation by government agencies and by protecting taxpayer dollars from risk.  Madam President, I think the bill that was passed last year makes a very good example of this. It was about priorities, and I congratulate Senators Enzi and Lieberman and many others on

The second thing it would do is it would create a benefit for any employer that does not like the way they are paying their health benefits. It would provide them the same kind of gain if they want to be allowed to keep their own cost of health care for themselves or if they want to change the way they pay for it so it

Mr. Speaker, families across America have to live within their means and balance their budgets. Unfortunately, they must do so without balancing the Federal budget on the backs of their children or Medicare recipients and you do not need to fear the Medicare trustees because they are on the right track to become able to pay for any cost reduction necessary. We have come so far in this Congress that it is going to be easy to do so again, and we should all do our part to achieve this so that every one of our parents can not only afford to have a good education but also that of their children. Let me read from the Congressional Budget Office report for the President's budget to show the differences and what we are really doing. The President will need a bipartisan majority to approve this budget and any spending increases so as to achieve the same goal of the

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Inhofe, I propose an amendment that would establish a commission to review the best methods of managing ex-offenders who return to the home of the former prisoner to be supervised by the State. The Senate will vote on the amendment after debate, the amendment will be printed in the Record, and, if it is adopted, it will be printed in the Record as soon as it is returned to the prison. The amendment would authorize the Secretary of Justice to enter into a memorandum of understanding with each of the States delineating the schedule, resources, and procedures under which the Secretary will manage such ex-offenders.  There are many challenges in the Federal correctional system today and many ex-offenders have returned to their States to start new lives and to return to their communities. In Oklahoma,

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I support the conference report to accompany H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 1997. These two bills provide an opportunity to reduce taxes for all American families in a manner that is fair to all taxpayers by extending the current tax holiday by 2 months and the new capital gains tax rate increase by 3 months. Tax relief is necessary to prevent economic growth from becoming even more costly and burden the economy with additional tax costs that are not needed to the detriment of the American taxpayers. In addition, these tax relief measures include several provisions which have traditionally been included in larger tax bills such as the repeal of the state and local income tax in the House and the Senate tax bills. However, these measures are much more important for the small businesses and farmers that I represent than they are for those large corporations and the large corporate interests that are

Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise today to oppose this Conference Report on the proposed balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.  Today the Congress took up legislation to end the most substantial tax increase in our Nation's history, an unfunded mandate that will hurt those who are least able to defend themselves, will threaten the most fundamental freedoms and rights that are enshrined in our Constitution.  This tax hike was necessary to help pay for the tax breaks that were necessary to support the creation of welfare state in the United States. And to give special benefits to those who earn the least or for the most will take away from others those who have no opportunity to earn anything and cannot give an honest opinion of themselves. Welfare reform is necessary because welfare benefits have become too expensive to justify and many welfare recipients will be required to

I want to share with the gentleman from Kentucky and to the Members of the other body that over the last 40 years there have been a variety of proposals to implement a Medicare plan with cost containment that we have never seen before because you were in Congress for 38 years. This budget, which is about $4 trillion in deficit reduction, is the largest entitlement program in history, even worse than the Ryan budget.  So the economy is not what it was 40 years ago. I don't know how this budget will affect the economy. What I do know is that we have this Medicare prescription drug benefit, which is going to be, in fact, more expensive than the Federal Government has ever run up and will continue to run

The voters rejected this on the basis that they needed more time to study this idea. They wanted some more time to study it. It will take just 2 more years for the voters to get their way on this issue.  California voters are in favor of saving water for people in California and nationwide in coming years and they will continue to do so because they want to get something done that is

From that war came NATO forces on the ground fighting to stop the Taliban from killing our soldiers. Unfortunately, the war for freedom has only gotten worse. It was the United States that pledged to support the Afghani forces, and it has proven what I have suspected all along: The Taliban leadership was killed in 2001 and never given a chance to establish a new government. The Pentagon was forced to admit that the Taliban is gone, and so have our troops.  The Taliban has not asked for American weapons. As much as we hate to admit it,

That money is not going to come from the general fund because this is a nonappropriated account. It is going to come from the Transportation appropriations bill in the Senate. That is part of the bill to deal with the Nation's transportation system and will give us time to make sure that the millions of Federal workers that are working to make sure the people can get to their destinations and where the goods are going are getting to the places where they need them most. And that money will come from the Transportation bill that is before us.

Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Chair, let me just make one final point and that is that it seems to me this legislation does indeed give Congress the ability to impose measures on the private sector on the same basis that we currently have the ability to impose measures on the Federal Government.  We already have a regulator that oversees the Bank of the United States and the five Federal Reserve banks. We have the Freedom of Information Act, for example, that the American people understand and understand well and we all respect and have and want in the United States of America and that the American people understand they are entitled to know what is going on behind closed doors and they are entitled to know that if there is something in there that they disagree with the Congress on, they can file a lawsuit against the Government if they are pleased

The first bill would transfer the Federal reimbursement for the purchase of title to the District of Columbia government to the general fund of the Federal Government and would require that Congress will include additional authority to make an additional Federal payment for the transfer. The second bill would authorize the District of Columbia to retain the general obligation and purchase of certain lands and improvements within the District of Columbia from the Federal Government and would prevent the transfer of Federal funds to the District unless it purchases the same amount of federal property within the next 10 years as the District would receive for the same amount of property at fair market value.

That is what we now face.  On Medicare and Medicaid alone, over a half million more Americans will no longer be covered than under last year's Republican legislation. Also on Medicare, over 400,000 seniors, many of whom will not be in need of Medicare in the year 2002, will no longer be eligible for Medicare and the $8,000 per year per senior this will mean in the long term in the year 2002.

I am not surprised that States like Florida are particularly concerned about it because the State governments and the Medicaid administration are concerned about it and already are moving very quickly to say that they are cutting expenditures by 30 percent and if you move out the fraud reduction budgets, the Medicaid providers might even be forced to come up with additional ways that Medicaid is reducing the fraud or their services are increasing the efficiency and the quality of Medicaid services, so that it doesn't work if they do not have a capability to reduce the costs of health care for the families they are trying to help. That is very good news because it means that the Medicaid funds are cut much more quickly in a more direct and very expensive way than any other time in the history of the Federal Government.

Mr. President, leader time is reserved, and there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour to allow Senators to introduce or speak on the pending business. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 3157, the Department of Defense authorization bill.  At the conclusion of debate on the motion to invoke cloture on the resolution of ratification of the treaty with Haiti and on the amendment to the fiscal year 2003 Defense bill, the Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow for the weekly caucus meetings. It is the majority leader's intention to proceed to a series of votes on Wednesday morning. There will be no rollcall votes during Wednesday's session of the Senate.

Despite all of the rhetoric to the contrary, we are actually talking about trying to reform Medicare in a way that we can have a more health care market for Medicare beneficiaries than it is today. So if you were to say to a typical small business that costs are going up 25 percent or more and they can no longer get any help from Medicare because they are increasing their prices to cover their costs, that they are going to have to cut back and drop benefits under the health care reform plan that they have as a result of that 25-percent rate of increase in cost and have to start over and that they have to cut back on their employees and then they have to say we cannot go on any more because of the cost. It is going to be so high that it is not cost-effective to do

Today the other side has already tried to answer the question of whether or not the President of the United States was a member of the Soviet Union at the time of the first attacks on New York on September 11 in the early morning of that morning on that day and if he was a member of the Russian Government at the time of that attack on that morning on September 11 and the Bush administration misled the American people about that attack on September 11.

This bill is not about the Second Amendment or firearms. It is about whether or not Congress is prepared to respond to the overwhelming threat of gun violence that has taken place in America and has continued to take place throughout the world and in certain parts of this world as a result of the Obama administration's failed foreign policy and President Clinton's lawless response to this threat. In fact, more than 200 people have died in the world as a result of domestic gun violence this year and nearly 100 in the United States alone. How can we stand by while we ignore the danger posed by guns when it is time for us to

First of all, I am not in favor of discrimination against children because the chairman of the committee has suggested that it be done with regard to religious organizations and other organizations because the existing law is that these special exemptions should not be made for religious organizations because of their importance and they could be effectively discriminated against, but there are no such exemptions for religious institutions which are in many instances involved in the education of children in some of our public schools and which teach a traditional subject such as African American or Hispanic education.

That is why I strongly support the current law to require that the United States troops be accompanied by United Nations personnel.   liberals respect the sovereignty of nations that do not allow even their neighbors to have an ability to have their own borders, and so they have been willing to take the U.N. mission as a challenge with open arms since it was approved by this House on this floor a year ago and supported by a bipartisan majority.
