program fact directly 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee the following question about the elimination of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology who was identified in the article this morning about the fact that the administration would not fund this program the way the Senate agreed it would be funded the previous year but will instead transfer it directly from the Pentagon's Building Sciences Account. The Pentagon Building Sciences Account, which includes the Office of the Under Secretary, is one of the principal procurement programs of the Department of Defense.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. I would be remiss if I didn't bring this up to the gentleman from California, who is also my good friend and probably the most moderate of all of us here in the House. He is in the minority here now because he made an extremely critical commitment to buy the debt of the United States. But the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Farr) made a rather critical contribution to the Government. I thank the gentleman for that.  The only point I want to make is we are not going to continue in what was done in the Committee on Ways and Means to remove our ability to vote on economic bills. That is what the Committee on Rules told us when they did that last fall. But I look forward to his support for a free market economy that really allows people to take their savings

Intent of the amendment No. 3 to grant authority to improve the manner in which the Department of Veterans Affairs provides care to disabled veterans was not previously part of the budget resolution. Under the proposed amendment, the VA may not work to improve payment methods or provide for flexibility in services provided for disabled veterans.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an outstanding community in Indiana's Eighth District which is being forced to close its doors because of the coming winter storm. This should be one of Indiana's most visited tourist destinations with nearly 400 million people each year. Today, Hoosier and world travelers flock to the Great Lake as the result of the flooding, and the neighborhood of Rossville will lose its only small remaining brewery, at least until the Columbus City Market has returned.  I would like to take this opportunity to commend the citizens of Rossville on their excellent work on the Great Lake and Columbus, as well as ask the community to consider how they can best benefit from the flood protection and land use in their community.  With the ravages of spring snow and bitterly cold, this neighborhood is always beginning to open up.

The Keystone XL Pipeline Pipeline would create a 1,558-mile pipeline across the north-central U.S. that would bring 2 million barrels of refined petroleum from Canada through the tar sands of Alberta, Canada, to refineries in the United States. The proposed pipeline would create more than 10,000 construction jobs in Canada and around the United States, including 200 construction jobs in Arkansas. This $8-billion pipeline would be

The act has already been approved by the House of Representatives and the Senate as a part of the Fiscal Year 1996 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1996 by a vote of 363 to 39 in the House and two israelis in the Senate.  Idaho has some of the highest public land prices in the country and the prospect of returning this land to the people of the bombing area in the midwest will bring long-term economic stability to my State.  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.

This balanced budget is the second time President Clinton has passed a balanced budget and his plan is long overdue and it is long past due for a significant deficit reduction. This will not be the last time.  The fact of the matter is that this budget reduces the deficit by $10.6 billion over the next 5 years. It reduces the Federal budget deficit in the year 2002 by $3.1 billion. It reduces the Federal debt to $19.5 trillion and it will have cost the Federal Treasury $10.6 billion less in the year 2002 than in the year before.

Mr. Chairman, that is correct. We set a $25 million threshold because we said if the study was fair, if there was an independent entity on both sides of the argument that could come in and say that $25 million should not be implemented in an average $50 million expenditure and compared with the $25 million threshold, that we would expect the committee to provide a $25 million offset for all of those increases that the gentleman from Louisiana just mentioned at the $50 million percent increase in request as proposed by the administration that would be proposed under this amendment if that amendment were adopted.  So the regulations would not take effect if $25 million per year were not provided in all cases, all instances, and I think that is all of the amendment that the committee will consider.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Madam President, I am here to speak on the Koch brothers, but first I want to say that the Senator from Washington and the Senator from New York are doing the right thing on this issue. I said on Monday that if a group like the Koch brothers were getting large as a result of this administration being more center-right in policies, if a group like the Koch brothers were spending as much as they do on lobbying in this country, we would know where they are spending their money.  I find that to be very interesting because, as the Senator from Washington so correctly said, the wealthy are doing phenomenally well and the middle class are losing ground. I have to tell you, it reminds me of the moral code when I hear people talk about being for and against abortion or I will hear them talk about them at dinner parties

Mr. President, this debate is not about the overreach of an agency because indeed this is overreach by an agency. It is about an agency that has already sent a decision over to the court of appeals that might be used as a base to further go in the wrong direction in rejecting the call for the funds for the Middle East peace.  This is about preserving jobs, not eliminating them.  Under the majority's amendment, the House of Representatives majority wants to go to the Middle East peace fund for peacekeeping operations. The Senate and House of Representatives have offered various alternatives, but they are not real alternatives because they do not have the force of law on them. So here we have the Senate and House of Representatives in a desperate attempt to reverse a United States Supreme Court decision which would protect their budget under the assumption that we will

Just 1 month ago this week, 4 million Americans lost their unemployment benefits and more than 50 percent of those 6 million have lost their jobs since December of last year. These statistics yield no easy answers as to why this is happening, but there is no doubt that Congress has a problem.  It is a combination of the rising cost of the mortgages we finance, the inability of businesses to get credit, lack of action by our Federal Government, or both.

This social program was meant to be a temporary aid program, to help poor people move from welfare to work. In fact, the need for welfare assistance in the Great Depression was so great that one commentator said that the country would now be in the midst of a race to the bottom when it came to the need for people to move out of the `` head of the sleeping rich `` and into the `` middle class `` of America.  These were never what we were promised. This program has already led to an astounding 1.5 million welfare rolls. Many millions more have died from despair, and millions have been thrown from welfare altogether.  Now our modern welfare system of a workfare approach

Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who were sacrificed to the one State which has been the true home of the ancient history and the extraordinary contribution of the Greek people to the modern world. We observe it also to honor the contributions of all Greeks who continue to serve on our Armed Forces.  While in the United States, Greek Americans participate in several important international organizations. The American Federation of Greek National Association, the National Association of Greek Business and Industry, and the National Association of Greek Health Plans are effective in advocating for the Greek people.

Final sequence: 

Specifically, the amendment will do two things. First, it would allow employees to recover more if they had their own liability insurance as an employee for all period of time while they are at the employment agency after their arrival in the country or just before they get to the country when they are there to claim the second-best option and they hire an agent or a hiring officer in order to go through the hiring process so that they can get their own insurance before they leave the country.  That could provide for a maximum of $1,000 per employee per year. So employees could get more and people at the agency who were hired could get less, too. That ought to make for a leaner agency and provide, I think, a better overall return. I think that is not something that the employer needs to worry about doing.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the bill's sponsor and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and an outstanding member of our Committee on Energy and Commerce. And the reason that we are so very focused on our global warming conference this evening is because New Jersey is going to be dealing with the impact that we have on our energy prices.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>                                           {mlvl}  It is an invention.

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment of the gentleman from California because I think it does a great deal of good if we can go back to what is currently in the bill and look what it actually does to the issue of family planning education. It actually goes back to the language which was put into the House acting through the Committee on Ways and Means dealing with what is called the word ``proposed.''  Essentially what the gentleman wants to do, as he is attempting to suggest that this, in fact, makes this the only form of family planning that we will provide through government, I think is simply incorrect. In fact, we have a whole series of ways in which family planning is made available to women, and each of them has been modified, and as a result,

Mr. Speaker, families across America have to live within their means and balance their budgets.  Unfortunately, those of us in this Chamber have not seen the light and are not willing to see fiscal discipline and economic growth brought about by balanced budget and tax reform without cuts in Medicare. I think we ought to do the math on that one so we can make sure we really understand what we are doing. The Speaker says they are going to give us a list that he will do it for them. What we need to do is do it for our seniors rather than do it for ourselves because they do not afford this.  While we are up here debating with each other who will pay, how do we come to the conclusion, that we really ought to make sure we are bringing about the kind of economic growth which is going to result from balancing

Mr. President, I support the conference report to accompany H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 1993. This tax bill increases taxes on the very wealthiest Americans and their families. The majority's solution is to let tax cuts for the wealthy go to the rich people. In the past 2 years alone we have seen over $250 billion in tax cuts for farmers, small business, and the very wealthy, who are not likely to work but to pay taxes that accompany those tax breaks. We have cut the capital gains tax. We have cut payroll taxes and earned income tax credits. At the same time we have increased taxes on our low-income families and that is the real problem. This tax bill is simply a wrong prescription for our country.  The average working American today pays over $6,000 in taxes on

Mr. Speaker, I also oppose the legislation on the grounds that it contains a number of controversial provisions which will have serious and disturbing consequences for our Nation's security.

This year this bill does just the opposite by continuing and increasing the production tax credit for wind production and production growth for 30 percent more gross capacity.  It is clear that the only way to ensure that the American people have access to affordable, clean, and reliable energy is to develop it from sources that are less expensive and will actually produce power.

Because I do not believe my colleagues understand this issue and would like to have the opportunity to review them, I ask that they be printed in the Record immediately after my statement in stark contrast to what took place prior to that presentation to be introduced in the House of Representatives by the President on February 28 of last year and a Republican majority in the House of Representatives when Lewis Powell and Harry Byrd brought his second and final health care bill to the House floor on March 21, 1994.

snowe prime department 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, I recently presented a joint statement with Senator Snowe regarding small business contracting and the Department of Labor law regarding the rights of labor during contract negotiations. It is my understanding that this is not a labor issue at this point in time, but that we are likely to be talking about it in the near future on the President's cabinet appointment list for prime contractors.  This is an issue of serious concern to small businesses across the country. Republican and Democratic Senators from Maine have weighed in and voiced support for Senator Olympia Snowe in this body.  I believe that it is important that the small business community come together in support of these improvements to the law, one of which is by reforming the quid pro quo rule to require private business to pay a fair market value for the services they provide when they receive government contracts.

It is a program that people have come to rely on for critical health care. Many women and children in nursing homes, young people with disabilities, and the disabled have relied on Medicaid for their health care, a program that is only good for so many, it is only good if it works and if Medicaid helps it work.

army battalion pride

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1055 to grant the Congressional Gold Medal to Donald Robert ``Mike'' Ellmers of California for his contributions to military officers and military units in the Armed Forces. I want to thank my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for the great work that they have done on this great Army National Guardsman.  What makes the contribution and commitment of Mike and all Army National Guardsmen so remarkable is that he enlisted in the Army Reserve Corps Battalion after graduating from the University of California at Davis and served in the Navy. He was a third class pride of the University of California and went on to be the second highest ranking commissioned officer of the University of California at Davis--the highest honors and the best places to deploy for two college cadets.  Mike is also, as you heard, a university

Mr. Speaker, the situation in Afghanistan is as bleak as I can remember at any time and we are all too familiar with the political tensions and threats to U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. But there is a growing movement of NATO troops to Afghanistan to find and bring peace to Afghanistan. I have no doubt that we will support them. As the Taliban struggles to regain control of its territory, so must the United States.  Our troops are great partners and we can count on them to accomplish their mission. NATO is not unique in its responsibility for the safe release of those soldiers who are in harm's way. I expect our great ally, Canada, will have the same commitment to give our troops the freedom to go anywhere at any time in the world, and will support them by providing funding to maintain those troops.

If the Republican budget does not improve America's military by $46 billion, which will be after 10 years or about $11 billion over the Republican budget for health care, I think we can stand on this floor and give very definitive reasons why the Republican budget is a bad budget.  First of all, if you take the following cost factors into consideration, the Republican budget is $51 billion more expensive than the President's budget. Second of all, Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget does not offer real Social Security tax relief. Third of all, the cost of the Republican budget is likely to rise because they are still going to spend all this money because they will throw the baby out with the bathwater.

That means that this bill will expire in 2029, and that is disappointing.  My first bill is the NEST Act which we also introduced in May of last year.

I truly believe that they are not going to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in terms of what is being discussed or what is not being discussed in the budget agreement that will be sent to us this week because they have been able to deal with it at the State level. The bill that is on the table by the Senator from Ohio addresses very specifically the so-called Social Security set-asides. Most of the blank is made up of the economic statements that the gentleman from Ohio did not bring to the floor to challenge the fact that the real motivation behind the favorite politician line was to have as much money in the bill as possible and to assure a Republican House with control of the House.  So I thank the Senator from Ohio for his efforts in getting through that process and we are prepared to deal with that

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the Community Partnership to End Veteran Homelessness Act of 1996, and to oppose the President's proposal to increase the minimum wage. The increase proposed in the 1996 National Community Service Act will increase the $5 minimum wage to $7 an hour over the next 7 years from $5 to $6 an hour in 1995 and from $5 percent to $6 percent in 1998 and 1999. The proposal would also create jobs for the over 100 million independent contractors throughout the Nation and would help young people work more toward their education goals. In my home State of Michigan, over 13,000 low-wage or self-employed men and women are enrolled in the National Council of Senior Citizens' Mediation Assistance program. I am proud to work with the council and support this legislation.  Unfortunately

Mr. President, I have come to the floor every week for the past several months to urge the President to release his administration's fiscal year 1996 budget proposal. This week I want to remind the President that it is not his budget but his proposals which will define his policy as President next year. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have accused us of not being `` coup leaders, extremists, and budget experts.'' Well, it is our intentions as Senators and Americans to stand up to the President in a vigorous and direct fashion so that he can address the pressing national security concerns we face today and Turkish foreign policy issues as we approach the end of the fiscal year. It is our sincere hope that the President will work with us to craft a policy that protects our interests, as well as American interests.  Mr. President, there

Mr. President, as I listen to the debate tonight about Section 222, which invades the intent of Congress in requiring notification for plans to offer benefits in the President's State of the Union Message to Congress, it is clear that the debate should not be about the Senate amendment, which would strike this provision. The debate should not be about whether Congress should pass legislation to implement the measure. The Senate is best positioned to resolve these issues in the context of addressing all of the benefits that Members of Congress are compelled to offer.  It is important to stress that the amendment offered by the Senator from California would simply strike the first of nine sections requiring the White House to submit a supplemental plan to Congress on which it would be required to provide notices within 30 days of offering any such benefits.  The one exception to this language would be if the President

It is forcing many of us to look for new ways to bring down that cost and to increase that savings through the so-called Tennessee Valley Authority State program and Mississippi Valley Authority purchasing program.  But in spite of these efforts, many folks still don't think about it. We are not sure why. Many of us don't really know where it all came from.  The economic theory of supply and demand--also known as supply and supply--has been one of my best sources of knowledge for many years. I used this theory to see if it was true.

I know milk is one of the finest foods that can be produced in this country in a number of ways, but I was informed that the legislation does not have a provision that allows the appropriation of milk for any purpose.

Mr. President, I would like to note at this point in the Record that on June 15 of last year in a highly publicized meeting of the various Federal Reserve banks, we heard from some of our colleagues who came to make clear the number of Republicans and Democrats in favor of a balanced budget amendment and a balanced budget amendment that takes the House and Senate out of the business of giving advice and consent about the budget of this country. There are aisle-crossing Senators, here and there in the House of Representatives, here and there in the Senate. Some will go so far as to direct one of their citizens to make a report in support of this amendment to a Federal Reserve Board. We were prepared to debate the issue and vote, but we were not prepared for the shenanigans, we were not prepared for what we now find out today

To say it more simply is that the U.S. must never put into our Nation's interests in Haiti a national security interest at the United Nations level or even a European concern in Europe without our blessing and approval.  I am deeply concerned about the implications this might have on our relations with our close friends and allies and profound reservations. As recently as June, General Thomas Fielding, a Joint Chiefs spokesman, noted that ``The U.S. will be directly involved with only the security and sovereignty of Haiti. I would hazard a guess that we will take into account the intentions of this radical regime before we intervene, and that would be a serious mistake.''

This is a reduction from the deficit to the budget deficit of $26 billion in fiscal year 1996 and $33 billion in fiscal year 1997 based on our seniors, the income, the business and the tax compliance of this Nation, our interest costs on our interest funds and our payment of taxes.

Small and medium-sized businesses across the United States and across the world are looking for a safety net to help them adapt to the economic changes in our global economy, which have changed the nature of our economy. In turn, we as the Federal Government are trying to find ways to make sure our businesses remain competitive as businesses need that safety net to go into the next century.  When it comes to capital, we as a Nation have invested a

Mr. President, I rise to support the bill. This bill offers us an opportunity to stop the increase in government spending and begin to turn the corner of the Federal debt into private capital that will pay down the national debt by the year 2002 as the President's budget makes spending reductions. We should be following the President on this issue. That is the Constitution.  I introduced this legislation last spring, as I have indicated, with the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) and Senator Moseley-Braun. The legislation, which I thought was an excellent concept for us to discuss, was called the ``Airline Leasing Program Cost Reduction Act of 2005.'' It was introduced in the Senate but never sent to the House of Representatives. I introduced it in the House under the unanimous consent agreement that this language had been read.

The challenge we face is to bring those promises forward so that it not only works for the American people but also works for the American businesses that need to deal with this challenge and make the best decisions that they can to be here and to be a part of this economy of our country that can create jobs and also Speaker Pelosi said that this is her greatest challenge yet as she meets today with President Trump and the new Congress and many of her Democratic friends in the House and Senate.

pass bill moment 

Final sequence: 

In a moment I will yield to the Senator from Minnesota who I very much admire very much. But I think it is worth reminding people in this great country that what we have is very simple. This bill is not a job creation bill or a jobs bill. There is not any opportunity to gain any gain from it when we pass this thing. It is not going to create anything and there is not any opportunity to make anything but the difference in how we would do things if we really wanted to make a difference in the life we really want to be in this moment. But that is the way it is now, because the Republicans did not get the votes to change the system of Government so that we would want to reform the way Congress works.  But, of course, people keep attacking us as cranks, as radicals

Madam Chair, just so we don't forget where we were, Colorado in August of 2008 had the largest drop in electricity sales since the Eisenhower administration in which we had 40 percent of all electricity sold by the year 2000. The price of electricity in the Colorado market plummeted for a week and then went up again after that; and so the only way that we could beat the market was to pass a clean energy bill.

Final sequence: 

I was in an appropriations meeting today. I heard time and time again how we were cutting back education programs in the Armed Services Committee and why children would need more children than they do today. That was absolutely correct. We did not want kids to drop out because the cost of higher education would have been too high for them to borrow. So we reduced the rate of increase in Pell Grants and we made higher education for lower-income families and those at the bottom of the economic ladder even more important.  And now the Defense Department budget request that will come to the House floor, I can't believe that we are doing that. I guess it is an attempt to cut other important programs in order to offset those programs that we did not like.  I say to the House of Representatives, ``What you just did was good,

As President Bush noted in March of 2003, if not sooner, training could become a weapons stockpile, as evidenced by the very real threat that the Internet posed to the military.  That threat was recently confirmed by the Department of Homeland Security, which in the past year has warned that all U.S. networks could be potential targets of a cyber attack as early as the year 2000.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. Musgrave), the author of the bill, the chief author of the bill and the sponsor of this legislation.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

direct united investment 

Final sequence: 

Mr. President, today, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would promote trade and investment in America and the Western Hemisphere, and increase opportunities for United States-based companies to access critical agricultural and environmental markets for many years to come.  I want to begin by offering my support for the Public Investment in American Dreams Act of 2012. This measure would expand direct trade investments in U.S. agri- and environmental products, as well as direct direct investments in companies with long track records of U.S. expansion and development.  What's important to remember here is that these trade policies represent an investment in American jobs that makes America better and freer. Before we vote to authorize these trade policies, we should be asking how those policies benefit America and our workers. We should be having honest discussions on the steps that can be taken to ensure

The senior Senator from Florida wants to answer any questions I might have, but I know we will have more time later on.   Calendar No. 187, S. 1305, legislation that is about filibuster reform, encourages those of us who want a filibuster-proof filibuster to filibuster--deduct up to 20 amendments--oppose a filibuster-proof filibuster, eliminates circumventing the filibuster by offering an amendment, and gives the people a maximum opportunity to get ahold of their representatives to make sure this is treated as a fair process for our minority members to participate in.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

It passed this House in February of that year, was signed into law by the President on March of that year, and I was a cosponsor of that law at that time and I am happy to be back again because insurance is an option and the American people have that right. We can now have insurance that is here to keep people on their parents and their friends and their family and their job when they need it and when they can no longer be Uncle Sam and Uncle Father.  I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan bill that will be coming up later today, the ``Small Business Health Fairness Act.'' I urge my colleagues to join me to pass this important piece of legislation and I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. President, I delighted that the Senate is about to pass the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 2006 that protects both Federal law enforcement officials and the American people from being intimidated or threatened by others who use the Federal criminal court system to seek and obtain unjustified and often illegal results that they would not have believed possible if they had not been in the United States. As I said earlier today in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, the Federal criminal court system works better for the American people than the Federal courts in the State and local courts. We can all agree on that.  Yet, we often hear from attorneys that Federal judges and other Federal law enforcement officers are the subject of threats and intimidation, particularly by other Federal judges. This makes it harder to prosecute them for crimes that are just as serious as those that the Attorney General prosecutes the

Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey and my colleague from Delaware for their leadership on this issue and on other issues that will be coming before the Senate later this week. I appreciate the work they have done to move legislation this year that will address an important national security issue. While I support the committee's report and the Senate bill, I am concerned that we did not take advantage of additional time that would have been available under the Senate bill to conduct additional oversight on Mueller's appointment.  I was concerned, and I wrote to the leader, that we may not have had sufficient time to respond to specific criticisms of the White House. The Senate committee noted a need to consult with our intelligence community on issues involving White House contacts. I believe that after examining the meeting, actions, and communications between the President, his associates

Mr. President, today the Senate begins in earnest our efforts to determine if our colleagues on the Republican side understand our genuine concern about the possibility of a catastrophic attack in the United States of America on American soil from some unfortunate foreign state of our Government that does not really have any legitimate reason to do what it is doing because it believes that the testimony given to us by the United States Congress by our senior officials and others ought to justify action by our government in its response to that threat.  Before we begin our earnest deliberations, Mr. President, I think it is useful, Mr. President, to say a few words about the background of this legislation.  Mr. President, my understanding is that at the time this legislation came before the Senate, a number of Senators had suggested to me that the recommendations of the committee recommended legislation would

In fact, the committee has provided a two-year balanced budget to our troops and they have been well funded since that time in Iraq and Afghanistan and Afghanistan has gone well in Iraq and Afghanistan with Iraqi expenditure being reduced because of the reconstruction efforts being undertaken. That is appropriate. We have done it for other countries and we should do it for Iraq and Afghanistan as well.

What is new to this is that the issue that is being debated this morning is the President of America granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. This would require the expenditure of more than $10 billion by taxpayers across the country to pay employers for hiring these illegal immigrants, for an immigration program that will cost us hundreds of billions of dollars.

We need to move ahead with hearings on increasing the number of full-time military judges because Senate leaders have promised that when they bring up a floor increase to increase the number of judges in the Federal courts that would be more than half of those who currently work in this massive Federal court system. Increasing the number of full-time higher rise judges in a situation like this requires debate and discussion.  If we do not move ahead with hearings and hearings on judges, if this amendment is adopted, the current process of selecting Federal judges to fill vacancies in the court system will continue, at least in part because the Supreme Court regularly grants several exceptions to lower court court rulemaking that would allow certain special group members to be appointed to circuit court judgeships.

nation postal year

Mr. Speaker, in the past year, the United States Postal Service has attempted to close postal operations in seven States in this country because they have been hit in a last-minute economic crisis with nearly 14 months ago a $10 billion Federal Government shut down due to the Nation's worst budget crisis in decades, and that came in March of 2009 during this last year's stimulus package. That makes it 13 times the number of times it has been attempted since 1934, and I would predict that this is the latest in a series of this postal shutdown attempts that has occurred, so that we have a total of 11 such closures that have occurred since 2002.  In all, since the last major Government shutdown of 1998, this House, which is the most current Congress, has not done anything in that area. This is a fair example of a

Not even the IRS says this. Only the Treasury Department uses this convoluted system called ``economic depreciation'' to calculate the amount of American taxpayers in the year 2004 and 2004 for the year 2005. In order to be allowed to receive a tax break for 2004 from Washington, the American family simply has to have gross income above the thresholds set by the Treasury Department. In fact, we have shown we are not the only country using economic depreciation. In Japan, businesses can take advantage of it. In fact, our Treasury Department estimates that at least one-third of all expatriate families nationwide will take advantage of this loophole.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Executive order 105-72, issued by Chairman Levin and Senate Minority Leader Mikulski in 1994, will apply to the FAA rulemaking process.  I would like to explain the rationale behind this legislation and its specific provisions. The FAA rulemaking process adrudes the Court's ability to review and extend.

The record will reflect that on a number of issues during the preceding year, beginning in 1993, there was an explosion of activity with regard to programs, hearings, and actions to go after disparities in the fair compensation earned by working women and minority men.

I hope this bill is an example of what the State Department's main mission should be, making sure that the United States remains relevant and committed to a positive engagement in countries that we may not otherwise visit.

Tax reform should be a part of our economic policies because it is a trade-off between the economy and national security. America has been through a huge economic downturn over the last 3 years and it is no longer economic growth that we are trying to help out the South Dakota economy. As a result, the State has run up a $61 million deficit.  These kinds of problems are not sustainable, and reform is the only way to get our economy back on track. Right now, Federal tax laws still have very little impact on the economy. Even with the end of the Bush administration, our tax laws are working. Businesses in the South Dakota economy are already projecting

For example, we would have liked to have had people on the waiting list and then arrived, but as the gentleman from South Carolina, the chairman of the subcommittee, has pointed out, not every request was put on the waiting list.

Therefore, the amendment would undermine all States that oppose or oppose this legislation. While it may sound good, I cannot imagine that this information will ever be made available. What clarity there is would be to States about political subdivision requirements, but I am sure there would be no one who would have the time and money to be a spokesperson on these points, so we are simply doing a wrong thing.

Mr. Speaker, for many women and their families, higher health care costs means the difference between health and health care in their lives. Federal subsidies are helping the American people and families pay higher costs for health care by covering the cost of health care that many would be forced to pay by a reduction in the bill on their insurance premiums.  Many benefits that women have access to cannot be had without an insurance premium subsidy. Medicare and Medicaid provide health care to hundreds of millions of our seniors, disabled, and others. Millions more of those people still pay out-of-pocket expenses for their medical care or can no longer afford to make long-term care health care choices.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated a reduction in the cost of the Medicare program would lead to 14 million more in monthly premiums and reduce health care coverage for some 27 million

Mr. Speaker, international education and Federal support for it is critical as we work to achieve our national security objectives. The legislation before the House today promotes education by giving priority for tax dollars to foreign countries that support and provide a better education for their students than those in the United States. This provision is very important to all Americans in general and foreign affairs in particular as we fight an existential war with a potential ally and the potential terrorist enemy of the United States and the allies that seek peace in the Middle East diplomatic efforts.  This legislation does this by expanding and enhancing current levels of assistance to non-governmental organizations, of which there are over 100,000 in the Federal Government. It increases funding for education to meet the needs of students, as well as students in individual foreign countries, to reach future college-educated leaders of the world

Mr. Speaker, this week the House will begin moving into the end game for the Obama stimulus bill. During the debate on the legislation the Speaker repeatedly assured the Senate that Republicans would support the bill when it came to the floor next week. Republicans have gone so far as to have the bill subject to a filibuster on the Senate side by the Republican leader on the Republican side on issues not agenda items. Now the Speaker says they want to end debate on a piece of legislation that would increase spending on domestic programs.  Mr. Speaker, the two most striking things that I have found about this bill are first, the President's proposal to spend over $1 trillion in just 2 years on an infrastructure project, the second part of the administration's effort to fight off the hurricanes, and the third part of their budget number is that it includes

This morning the Armed Services Committee held a hearing entitled, ``Iraq: Resilient Nations--The Defense of Freedom. A Full Report.''

Senate language by Senator Byrd provides the funds for our Nation's schools and summer jobs program at levels higher than last year's appropriation levels.  Since the base bill would authorize $13.4 billion for programs in all 13 public education departments, all 13 education departments and all of the individual fields, I am pleased that this bill includes $4.6 billion in fiscal year 1995 appropriations for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, one of the most important federal food assistance programs in our country, over which the current administration has very little control.

That is how we determine whether we are going to come up with legislation that we can vote on to send the message to sports that this is not the time to have performance-enhancing drugs in sports.  It is also important that we know that no one out there is a genius in designing an athletic performance enhancer. It is not going to happen that way. We do know that some people will take

Mr. Speaker, I think sometimes people are missing the point, and that is that last week the President said that by the year 2004 the Federal Government is going to have spent at least $35 billion in Iraq and by 2007 that has just been extended. Now if that is the case I don't think we should be calling it a balanced budget request because it has not been balanced. Robert Rubin said the debt of the Federal Government is going to be $11 trillion in the year 2005. If you add $5 billion to that, then that amounts to $20 billion for the plea bargain to lower interest rates, which would bring the Federal debt to $12 trillion. So the argument that they are trying to make is that spending is out of control in this country and we should not be burdening our kids and grandkids with that debt

Our Government has the right to defend our country, and we have our allies to help us win.

projects bill chairman 

Final sequence: 

I thank the gentleman very much. As you can see, when I start talking about welfare reform, I work on projects with the Democrat chairman of the committee and the Republicans who are in the majority. We make sure that the bill we're debating here has a CBO score that is accurate. It is the truth.  I think it's important for Members, not only Democrats, but Republicans and independents who want to learn more about the details of this legislation to realize that there is a lot of misinformation out there. There is a lot of misinformation about this bill that, unfortunately, is coming from both the inside and outside of Washington, DC, as well as across the country. But I want to encourage my colleagues to listen, because if you do, you will discover some major problems with this bill that Republicans and Democrats can agree on

middle aired leaders

Mr. Speaker, the Middle East Research Institute, which monitors extremist media, recently reported on a new conference between the Iraqi government and representatives of the Hezbollah political movement in Lebanon. According to Middle East News Service, the leaders in both Lebanon and Iraq are holding similar conference meetings in order to reach an agreement on a political solution in Iraq. In the past several months, Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki has stated that he has aired his desire to reform the Iraqi constitution, which he was not willing to do at the time of the uprising. The leadership of Hezbollah certainly does not want to abandon a significant part of the country that is heavily populated by Sunnis and Shia. It will not turn a blind eye toward sectarian division, but apparently realizes that, once an agreement is signed, sectarian tensions will be on the wane and a political solution will

Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from California, Congressman Bob Matsui, for organizing this Special Order to bring attention to this issue and to that which Congresswoman Maxine Waters alluded to earlier in addressing Speaker Pelosi's policies which have led to even worse problems in China.  While much has been said about the massive trade imbalance between China and the United States, there is still no question about the fact that most things have changed in the post-1994 era.  The new generation of Chinese is increasingly small business owners and environmentalists who take a keen interest in human rights in China. I was fortunate enough to be a part of that earlier in my career as the Chairman of the House Subcommittee on International and Public Affairs, which has jurisdiction over China's trade, including our Western Hemisphere, Korea and Taiwan, as well

So we have been trying for years to create a Federal legal standard, or State standard, on what is a store and is not a store to the public. We think it is important.

We have seen government spending soar to record levels and dangerous economic conditions force the government to borrow and spend now more than ever before. We are going to have to work with the American people to reform our tax system in order to have any chance of alleviating our fiscal woes.

Thank you very much.

By the end of the year we will kill the PAYGO rule. What that means is that we will start the government by slowing the rate of government growth for the first time since the Bureau of Reclamation started tracking their growth rate in 1900. The reason for this change is that current law prohibits any major employer from increasing its employee compensation, yet what you are holding up on is even more restrictive new health care regulations that are hurting small businesses in our economy and in our country

This means that if you can still make a living with your amputated foot, then you will have to make that work in your existing job which requires some health care coverage under Medicare. Also part of your medical care plan must be a program that allows people to buy private insurance coverage from the private insurance market and not only require coverage under Medicare but also provide coverage for certain annual foot amputations. Because the self-employed are restricted from competing against Federal programs such as Medicaid, they are limited to buying private insurance coverage for their prescription drugs. As a result, many people are forced to work out of necessity and are forced to quit their jobs or go back to work before they can afford to buy private insurance coverage that they can buy out of pocket or qualify for Medicaid.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

The current $100 million ban in this bill has been in place since 1985 when the first anti-abortion measure since the 1973 decade was enacted, the Hyde amendment.  The Hyde amendment is the ban on Federal funding for abortions. The ability to use nonpublic money to pay for abortions overseas stems from the original intent of Congress. The original Hyde amendment prohibited the use of Federal money to pay for abortions in cases where the mother's life was in jeopardy. In

I yield myself another 2 minutes. What we do in that bill is try to increase the quality of the Medicare system so that we can provide the best possible health care for every single American. We do not want to place a burden on our senior citizens and do not want to place a burden on the people who are going to be going out of the system because they want to make sure that they can get that kind of health care that they think they need but think they should not have because we think that mistake has been made, and we want to make sure it is not made again. Just minutes ago, the Senator from Illinois said there is a massive mistake in the Medicare Program. That is absolutely true.

Mr. Speaker, according to 2006 data, nationally, 799,000 children have spent at least 24 hours in a day in an emergency room for an emergency need. Approximately 565 children were admitted to the hospital in 2006 for an emergency need of 24 hours or more and 40 percent of those children were from families with incomes below $100,000.  In 2005, 543,000 children, or 19 percent of all children cared for in emergency rooms, were hospitalized for a life-threatening emergency requiring long-term hospitalization.

The $6 trillion debt that was incurred by this Government to pay for the $1 trillion worth of tax cuts has nearly doubled the $700 billion worth of dollars of revenue from $600 billion worth of dollars million to almost $4 trillion worth of dollars million. It has made this nation's economy weaker, it has caused our families to have fewer jobs, and it has had a very adverse impact on children and on the American economy.

This is in direct conflict with the very words spoken in the previous administration by the President when he said that we would make sure that our priorities were set in this country for our future as a country and that we would have a war against domestic terrorists so that we do not have to send more of our people to fight in another country in the future with the share that we were asked to pay for it. So we have a very, very heavy responsibility in the country today. I congratulate the leadership for bringing it to the floor for a vote.

Mr. President, first, I appreciate the words of the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Washington.  I had not intended to speak on the tax matter but I do want to say there has been a lot of words here about taxes lately. The pay for government bill should have been there for a long time. It is paid for if they raise taxes or raise taxes by failing to raise taxes money and debt payments funds tax cuts paid for pension reform and health care reform. So there have been some good feelings about what people are doing now for Social Security, for other kinds of accommodation on the Budget Committee, but people should pay their fair share of taxes.  A tax cut is not paid for in any of those ways.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

I thank the gentleman. It is important that we adopt the Republican budget that offers the most aggressive tax relief we will ever have to help our Nation's middle class and do it without adding to our Nation's huge national debt and certainly without having this economy hurt America's future generations in the way that we are seeing today because I think the facts are very important.  The Congressional Budget Office, as you know, projections for the tax cuts that we're going to be seeing over the next 5 years will cut our debt in half. This chart really shows this trend. You will notice that as the numbers go up and the tax cuts are higher and the revenues go down, what you'll see in the red line is the debt not go up any further. The debt goes down. You will see that as the taxes go up.

Like the bill that I introduced earlier this year, this legislation will help ensure that our public broadcasting system is protected against Federal broadcast indecency efforts that the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional since March of 1993. It is not a question of whether or not one party has the right to control the airwaves or have it controlled by government.  Today the Supreme Court is engaged in a delicate negotiation with broadcasters over the rights to control the content of their broadcasts. The broadcasters who object strenuously to the broadcast industry's efforts to control how the American people receive their news and information should not be used to build the airwaves to which we aspire. We should be focused on whether we want to find a way to reward good conduct or penalize it.  This bill

So we are now scrambling to figure this out, and we have no idea what the answer is on how to make sure that this commodity remains in the bill, or how to make sure it cannot be wiped out.  So for the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire to get up in the Chamber, to come to the floor, to spend a good deal of time on the floor

Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to point out that last year we did Labor-HHS, DOD, and education together on this bill when it was coming out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. The last time we did this there were no earmarks in the bill that year for any of the two of those three committees that were then in session and for those that were in conference and to my mind we went in exactly the right direction when we put together this bill last year to the days when there was a very strong sense that the new majority and the new leadership would focus on giving more attention to some bigger issues, whether that be a balanced budget amendment, a plan for health care reform.  Mr. Speaker, I think the majority and the minority on both sides of the aisle have earned the right to prioritize where money is going. We have to

This will take place on Monday, November 9 at 5:30 p.m., following a period for morning business until 6:15 p.m. It is expected that next week President Bush will announce a foreign policy initiative to be presented to the Congress at the beginning of this session of Congress. The schedule may change for the remainder of the year as a result of the response to the terrorist attacks of September 11 and would require further announcement of that plan by the administration before the reduction in the number of congressional personnel can be finalized.  We have had a number of town meetings at all levels of government on the first order the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. I hope

So that is all we have to say. The President can decide how he wants to enforce the laws. But if he wants to strike down the Federal dollars that the Postal Service is using to pay lawyers to sue him, and we allow this amendment, he is not in violation of law.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

At the same time, the two sides in the budget conference were considering ways to offset what we do not agree on with the House of Representatives.  It is our hope that we can get a deal that goes back to where the spending is. There is no reason for any of us to wait any longer. The American people are looking for some type of agreement that, on the House side, will improve the situation. We need that package.

I know my colleague wanted to talk about student loans, so I will close my time this morning by giving a few more reasons why I think we need to have a balanced budget amendment that we will vote on next week when we take up the budget that will come to the floor in the coming days and come back to people this week and offer a balanced budget amendment to do to this Congress what President Bush and President Clinton did when they were out of office when they had a balanced budget and asked for our colleague to come to the floor and tell us what they were for and why he didn't sign it.  So, Mr. President, if you are in office, I want you to be honest about it. I do not think you want to talk about taking seniors and working people off of Medicare and Social Security to pay for

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 162 is the bill that we have before us today on the underlying legislation under suspension of the rules to address the Iran nuclear agreement that was imposed on the United States by the United Nations Security Council resolution passed on March 12, 2017. This is a short-term measure that was brought up in the Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday and reported on by the full committee on Thursday by voice vote in the Indian country of Canada on Thursday. It is similar to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that we had last year when it was brought to yield back to the House a single legislative day in the remainder of that month.  We have heard a lot about Iran nuclear negotiations. Many of us, Republican and Democrat, have been following the current negotiations as well as the

Mr. Speaker, last October I thought that it was absolutely necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein. I said that we did not have enough time to really make an honest judgment about what President Bush was doing. The reason that I did not want to go there is because I did not think that we could get absolutely the job done. And I did not want to resort to diplomacy because I did not believe that we had adequate troops to be able to go in there and go in.  It is not only the troops that were there that made us go. The logistics were here and the people that were there, and I was afraid that we would not get the job done. We ended up, however, under their control in Iraq, and we destroyed the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein possessed. I do not want to politicize the decisions

And that is exactly what we have to stand for when we criticize the President's budget. The kids are going to be better off in Washington.

Mr. Chairman, I commend my colleague, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi], for her rational, kind words as I rise in support of the Tiahrt amendment which would provide another $30 million for the REAL ID Act for State and local governments to secure their border.  This amendment would pay for the increased technology that is necessary to be able to ensure that we can use the freedom of movement that our American citizens have to travel to and from the United States in a safe and secure manner and also to ensure that in the areas of the Chinese Embassy and other major diplomatic buildings in the United States that Americans of Chinese descent can use the opportunity to travel without being accosted by a police or customs official.  As this year's battle in the Senate continues and as they get prepared to vote on the REAL ID Act, I hope the

units bill housing 

Final sequence: 

Mr. Chairman, I rise to introduce an amendment that I think fixes a provision of the bill that is seriously in conflict with the underlying intent of this bill. That amendment would require the Department of Housing and Urban Development to require mortgages to be affordable or be determined to be affordable with reference to the 30 percent reduction in family units loan limits.  I want to thank Chairman Lewis and Ranking Member Conyers for recognizing the problem I have had with a long line of mortgages made that are foreclosed upon, never sold, and so on because there is no affordability there.  Now if this bill is adopted in its current form, we will see more and more properties become foreclosed upon because they are owned by people who do not have any equity in them.  Instead of increasing the affordability of American homes, this bill punishes those people

Final sequence: 

Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time, maybe we can resolve this. I have had some conversations with the Senator from California and we would like to see some agreements reached on the issue.  So let us resolve the issue in the next few days, and I would hope we can come back to this in a very short period of time and then move on to something else that might be of great interest to the American people and would probably take a little bit more time and microphone time than it would take tonight.  So I think we can come back next week and we might find a way to settle this and move on and get this finished in Florida and Carolina and certainly the other midwestern States and maybe New York and some other places.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Final sequence: 

Mr. Speaker, this Member rises this evening to speak about the urgent need for a United States National Emergency Management Agency to ensure the safe and effective protection of the health and safety of Americans in the event of a public health threat in our country.  Let me stress that because of the risk of anthrax to Americans in public places like restaurants, concert halls, and parks, the NEA is a must-have component of an effective FEMA. We know it works. It is an essential part of the first responders, it is an essential part of the homeland security and is one of the most cost-effective and efficient plans.  The postal system in the district I represent has been targeted by postal employees in recent months. They have had to stop distributing mail and make it more difficult for workers and customers to receive a proper amount of

Mr. Chairman, a further parliamentary inquiry: Mr. Chairman, as we established in the previous colloquy, section ( colloquy No. 474) of the Senate bill is intended to eliminate the use of funds to create a trust fund to administer a cross-State plan to be established to replace the State of New York order [S&W] in the District of Columbia system. There is no parliamentary inquiry as to whether this language is the same language as previously deleted in H.R. 644.  The CHAIRMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be authorized to meet to conduct a markup on Wednesday, January 25, 2003 at 9 a.m. in the Senate Judiciary Committee Room on the Senate Grounds in Washington, DC. Those wishing additional information may contact the Committee on the Judiciary at the following number or write to the Committee on the Judiciary, Session Office Building, Washington, DC 20510. Calendar No. 19.  The  perfume of hope to people who wait in line to buy products they don't even want is not going away any time soon because the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2003 is spending more time on the Senate floor than any piece of legislation to date.  The reason is that too often Members do not read the bill. When the majority and minority amendments appear on this floor, Members

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere condolences to the family of Chief Petty Officer Roger DeMay of the United States Coast Guard and our thoughts and condolences to the crew of the Coast Guard cutter Alvin as they return from their 10-month deployment in the Persian Gulf and the last few days before the Court of Inquiry at U.N. Court-Martial to further probe the cause of the catastrophic crash of the Alvin at Mogadishu.  In the wake of the tragedy, which happened at the end of July and which was the first such tragedy on a Coast Guard cutter in 10 years, my thoughts and prayers are with the crew and loved ones of the Alvin. The past month has been a period of the deepest grief and heartfelt sympathy and a day of remembrance for the members of the Alvin crew. It was their

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to address a report that the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) just sent to the Committee on International Relations. That is a report that we have received from China that has concerns with China in Taiwan on the Taiwan issue. I have asked the gentleman from Georgia to review that report to see if we can find in his committee some light to refer it to the Committee on International Relations.  83 percent of the observer-State relations provided in the June 1995 report to the Committee on International Relations states that China is unwilling or unable to move forward with Taiwan's reforms and promote democratic institutions.  Mr. Speaker, China was the first country in the world to purchase Taiwan's last oil well on July 19, 1995. When China is given responsibility for

Mr. Chairman and Members, today I rise again in strong opposition to this bill. I am not speaking in opposition to the Committee on Rules Committee or the chairman. I have heard all of the good words about the committee being a little too easy to work with and with the Speaker, but in reality the Members on both sides of the aisle are very concerned about the public school Los Angeles public school system.  I have to admit, though, when the Solomon amendment was offered in our committee, the agreement was that we would not entertain amendments other than at the end of the day the Solomon amendment be the only amendment considered in the underlying bill.  I will be voting against this bill. I wish it were possible to work with every Member on both sides of the aisle, but in reality the committee is a little too difficult to work with
