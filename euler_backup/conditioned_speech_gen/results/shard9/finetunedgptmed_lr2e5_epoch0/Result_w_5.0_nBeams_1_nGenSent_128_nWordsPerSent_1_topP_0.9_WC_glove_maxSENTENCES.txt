Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Subcommittee on Defense of the Committee on Armed Services be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on Wednesday, April 29, 2007, at 2:30 p.m., to conduct a hearing entitled ``Military Force Structure and the Future of the United States Armed Forces.''  The  decentralization of the functions of the Federal Government is now all the more important because it is the only way we are going to be able to protect the people of this great Nation. Our military is not only the most capable but has the most innovative and best trained of all our other services. These leaders are working hard in

The War on Coal is too big to fail and needs to be brought to an end quickly and not because a war or an economic crisis may bring about it. It is simply because it is a big business problem that needs to be solved.  Even if it is that simple, this year's rise in electric rates is a bad sign for America's workers and their families. In the last quarter, the cost of electricity rose over 6 percent across the country. The Energy Information Administration recently reported that since 2000 the cost of electricity has increased by 3 percent and consumers pay an average of $5

The reality is it is very important that when this measure comes back in conference in the wintertime and this would not apply, that we do the proper job of allowing a robust discussion and putting in place what we can do to make sure that all of the things that the law requires in this bill get in place and that the process can work

Madam Speaker, I would like to discuss this bill because I am not certain if the Speaker is going to bring up an amendment. I think the American people are asking whether or not we are going to have a debate on this bill. I would submit that it is our goal to have a bill that the American people understand how to deal with and they understand how to vote for. That is what I hope we are trying to accomplish.  There are several things we want to ask the Speaker to clarify before we proceed. I would like to know what they are that they think should be added to the bill. Are there any items that could be added

You might not think so at first, but the money from private welfare is often too much to miss when you are poor and living on $2 a day or less. It gives a small help to someone who needs it most, especially someone who may be unemployed for a while. But it also gives a much needed help to a family struggling to work it off and pay their bills. Help them, make it work for them and for their children. And it does that through a program called Work for Kids. And that may be the most important and encouraging part of a $10 billion

One of those things was that my good friend and colleague Congressman Nick Rahall--this is the second time that he has addressed this House--has announced that he will retire at the end of this term.  Now, in my opinion, I have been a proud recipient of both the Capitol police and the police-on-the-street--two very important elements of the Federal Government that I really wanted to retire from.

This amendment would not only encourage other States to further look to this area for more interstate highway capacity but it would also create a new relationship between the local and State governments which would make it easier for the Federal Government to invest money in the States rather than through the Federal Government.

A great man is being honored today in the Blue Mountain News and on the Today Show as well as in other media outlets in America and around the world.  In 1988, Billy Leonard Rose graduated from the South Dakota Military Institute in Sioux Falls and went on to serve in the South Dakota National Guard for two years in the oil fields of South Dakota.

One of those fundamental freedoms is the right to protest, to question, and to speak in your own mind.

Mr. Speaker, last week the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center published a report showing that under current tax policies, many families in America would still be paying too much in taxes to finance health care. Health insurance is becoming increasingly expensive, and even many middle income Americans would have to pay higher prices to afford health insurance without Medicare and Medicaid.  While we do not yet have the full picture on how we would impact our economy and the health care costs they may bring, we know that we cannot afford to leave millions of Americans to pay the costs of health care through a tax increase in 2017 alone.

I rise today in support of legislation I am introducing that is very simple in a sense that it gives each American a chance to provide for themselves and their families so that they have the resources that they need in order to make sure that they are not out of work that can

Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota because the allocation of the money and the proposed expenses for the National Science Foundation is simply not enough. Even when the funding is not as much as I thought, it still is not enough.  I voted for the National Science Foundation when it was created in 1958 because I felt that we needed to strengthen and strengthen the Government's role in science and engineering.  This past November I voted against the bill that is before the Senate because of what the bill did not do. It did not allow for the independence of the NNSA from the Public Land and Forests to be questioned and addressed

Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of People v. Robert Bork to prohibit Congress from banning judicial review of legislation by the Federal Government in the area of school prayer. Since that time the Court has adopted the view that Congress has the constitutional duty to prohibit Federal courts from considering school prayer as constitutional amendments and then to apply the courts to the constitutionality of those amendments. Thus far the Court has not applied the usual test that would be required in any case involving a matter of such importance to the public interest.

According to the Government Accountability Office, student loans have been a major contributor to the cost of paying college bills in the United States since 1996 and now hold a full 77 percent of our national student loan debt. Nearly half of all borrowers will face severe penalties from the administration if they default on their Federal student loans before their scheduled due date. Federal student loans have increased from $2,460 per student in 1995 to $10,500 per student in 2002 and hold a combined outstanding loan limit of over $30,400. Education is a

Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to rise in support of this bipartisan package that we are introducing today and to provide some real relief to hardworking middle-class families that have been hit hard by the President's administration's economic policy in the last 2 years.  Our proposal would provide $200 million in additional child tax credits for families with two working parents and a dependent child on average when they need the assistance most and when the job is available. We are increasing the earned income tax credit for working families by $500 per family per year so that working families can still go to work and pay their taxes and help their families during the month they are

Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by again thanking my colleagues for their tireless and wonderful work for years and for their hard work to try and address a lot of different issues and programs for those who need them and want them for their health care costs.  I know the important message that comes from this Senate and the House is it has gone beyond the political theater of public pay-for and is a much more meaningful challenge in terms of reducing costs. It is time for Congress to make some real cuts in the programs that pay for health care for the people of America that we love so much, those of us who pay taxes and contribute to

When the Republican Conference held its first meeting since the health care law was signed and promised to cut Medicare and Medicaid by more than $100 billion to pay for it and to give more tax breaks to the people who made the health care law go up for vote at the beginning of the year, they found out the first item on the agenda is to cut Medicare and Medicaid spending by more than $100 billion to pay for the health care law. The other items will cost the American people $1.5 trillion in the next 7 years and will be made worse by the Nation's banks and Social Security savings accounts.  Now

According to the amendment, passengers would be able to use their cell phones to communicate with other passengers who are not current operators of electronic equipment to avoid having their communications taken.
