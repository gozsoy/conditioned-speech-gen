Mr. President, I have been the Senator from South Carolina for many years now so this may be a longer than I thought it would be but what I have learned so far is that I am still not what I think I should be because what I really need is a fact-finding commission to find out what happened in Iraq and if it is appropriate to bring them back on the job because it should not have happened in the first place because problems exist that I do not understand. This distinguished Senator from South Carolina is far more familiar with the way this world operates. I thank him very much.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from

It would actually increase to $10 trillion in deficit spending over the next 10 years in manufacturing, agriculture, and more than half of the tax cuts, the largest tax cut in history.  We would be spending more than the national debt, I would say to my colleagues, and this legislation would simply result in a spending surge. The House Republican leadership

Instead of helping the middle class to stay engaged, they want to stop it by making America more expensive to make and to produce. They want to make American companies leave overseas to avoid paying their fair share to the intending owners, and they want to make consumers bear the costs.  Let's take a look at where this is going, Mr. President: Because they have blocked Congress' ability to use trade enforcement tools and imposed unnecessary fees on the American companies making goods for American consumers, House Republicans are moving to block trade

The deadline was set by the United Nations Security Council in 1991, and I am proud to have led the effort to move this resolution forward. I am very pleased the resolution adopted in the Security Council last year finally recognized the tragic events of 1994 as one of the darkest chapters in

Mr. Speaker, I think I would like to use the time for one other discussion that is very important to our national security and to the people of the United States. We passed the bill that had health care for women--a Federal program that was paid for by putting Medicaid funds in the plan.  We have reduced by $150 million in the bill the assistance we give to women. That is because we are placing a premium tax on these women to pay for the benefit.  I listened to my friend and colleague talk about women on welfare. She said, ``We don't want that.'' This is the Republican philosophy. This is the GOP philosophy

This would be likely to result in buying less ammunition than would be purchased if all stakeholders in the ammunition supply process were consulted prior to the bill's enactment.  Since the 1993 ban on the manufacture of certain low-technology ammunition, the age of the industry has risen, and production capacity has declined. Both the Congressional Research

Restrictions on how governments enforce laws require no mandates, no mandates to enforce, and no mandates to enforce. Just as the very first bill in the United States Congress did not impose any mandatory regulations, so too do we need no more requirements to enforce our drug laws.

Although this is a rather basic black and white procedure of how the 10th amendment is read or voted on today in the United States of America or most of the rest of the percent of the population, it is important that it is included because it provides a framework that may help to reduce the resulting rates of unemployment in the Federal Government

But she has agreed to the question. She will not even let the words come out of her mouth that she now supports U.S. taxpayers borrowing their money to help the Kenyan Government purchase and set up companies that are now operating out of the United States.  Instead, as I said yesterday, she showed some of her true colors when she was here yesterday because she applauded the vote, the resolution,

Speaker Pelosi announced that she had taken this action to filibuster this measure. It should be noted that this is the exact same speech given by the President in 1995 and the exact same speech given by President Clinton in 1998 when he requested the same action on Amnesty.  It is entirely reasonable for Members of this body to be concerned about a number of the flaws in this bill

Mr. President, let me again remind people why we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act back in 2013 with bipartisan legislation. It passed overwhelmingly in the Senate Finance Committee and passed unanimously here in the Senate as Amendment 61.  The key to the Senate passing the Senate Finance Committee bill was, of course, the Secretary of the Treasury. He had the Department of the Treasury under his control to help bring the tax bill to Oklahoma. That was always the purpose. And so now the bill is ready to be signed into law.  That is where the second thing we did was very fortunate, I think.  The real world. The two papers I

This bill should come as no surprise because, since my service as chair of the Subcommittee on National Security, Education and Workforce Development, the Department has consistently issued rules that exempt certain children from school accountability and reporting requirements.  A recent report by the Department of Education concluded that 26.5 percent of the private school students in each district participate in ``assisted learning'' programs.

And for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I want to invite our friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gunderson), to offer us some facts, so we can make a judgment as to whether we are committed to the truth.

For that matter, even a year ago, our chances to emulate George Bush's major foreign policy victories, including seizing the initiative, were very high.

Mr. Chairman, in what other area do we have to develop our own law enforcement resources, and by its very nature, and in the committee chairman's opinion, to do so, while we are certainly not going to require States to expend money on training and having their own law enforcement officers that have such a critical role in our criminal justice system, then we in Porterville have to develop our own law enforcement resources.  The area of our being here on the House floor is highly critical to the safety of the people of Porterville. And even those in law enforcement jurisdictions have a firsthand story and they have seen firsthand what that system does to the training

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the body's approval of H.R. 1878, legislation that will resolve a longstanding constitutional dispute over whether Congress can constitutionally appoint Supreme Court justices for term limits and in what manner they shall be chosen or have judgment limited to a single term. This is not a new issue of great controversy in this body and in this city and town and lakefront. In fact, it is an issue, in my view, that raises questions of prudence and of fairness.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution in such a way as to

Madam President, in closing the debate on the Defense bill and in order to respond to some of the concerns and some of the differences that have been expressed today on the Senate side of the aisle regarding some of the provisions in the bill, and in the interest of trying to set the record straight as early as possible on what the details of what is in this bill are, I would simply say that the distinguished Senator from California has been a powerful advocate for many years in dealing with the needs of women. It was a group of women, after all, who led the effort that created the independent counsel case against President Nixon, a group that got him into

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, this bill addresses the lack of protection for the elderly housing programs that many Americans rely on to pay for their housing. I rise in strong support of this bipartisan amendment to the bill that will bring more homeownership to the many Louisiana families struggling with housing costs while Louisiana Orleans is currently experiencing a drought.  This amendment gives States the authority to increase coverage for 2 years under the cap set by the Housing Authority from $10 million to $20 million annually. This means that the share of coverage provided under this bill will be increased by nearly $3 billion per year.  I want to

This legislation will cut taxes for the middle class and small business Americans and extend the existing tax provisions which will support a permanent and expanded national assembly line.  The reductions will be passed on to the American people through savings to individual filers and companies and a tax cut for the average working family in this country.  However, the bill also contains a provision which will add significant uncertainty to the economy by expanding

What they recognize is that when you go to the grocery store and you buy the interior stamps, you are putting these people's lives on the line and putting their families' lives on the line for one tiny fact.
