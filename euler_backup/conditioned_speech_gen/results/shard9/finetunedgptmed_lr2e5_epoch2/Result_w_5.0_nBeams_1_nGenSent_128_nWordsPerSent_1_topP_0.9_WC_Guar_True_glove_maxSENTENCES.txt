Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Securities and Exchange Commission appropriations bill with a vote of 53 to 39. This committee worked very well to try to make certain that the funding level for this agency, which has been reduced by 25 percent over the last 5 years, will meet the funding needs of finance markets. There are few things I can say which I hope will dispel the impression that we are at a funding rate where the markets can more easily absorb the changes which are coming to markets because we have some great new financial institutions. We have some great new financial institutions in South Africa and China, in places where the markets have not yet developed.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment because there are reasons not to reform Medicare under this legislation. But we have no choice but to adopt the amendment if we really want to reform Medicare law.  I would like to make two brief points to support the proposition that Federal mandates, by definition, always hurt seniors. And these have always been known to hurt the elderly, the working poor, and other vulnerable populations.  Let's recall that the Kaiser Foundation has estimated that in this country, as a percentage of health expenditures, spending on prescription drugs is estimated to be at least twice as high as spending on personal care, food, and shelter

A question is not a question. What the American people want is to know whether this debate is about health care reform. That is why the American people should be very skeptical of the proposal being presented by the other side of the aisle to take back control of health care from the people of this country.

That is the first we have heard of the one-time peacekeepers who then joined the Roger Waters' peacekeeping force.

So the Bush tax cuts have really added money, which ought to be paid for. As for the subsidies, the Tax Foundation says $75 billion in subsidies will be added.

Mr. President, there is a misunderstanding about the extension of the Private Pension Security Trust Fund which expires in 2007.

I find it interesting, however, that the language in the committee bill contains two new actions.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, my amendment increases funding for cybersecurity and intelligence oversight at the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security by about $600 million. It also seeks to increase enforcement of congressional oversight of the intelligence community.  In addition to one-on-one oversight of intelligence capabilities and management from Porter Goss to Edward Snowden, the amendment limits the President's office's use of information from the National Security Agency's electronic surveillance program, Executive Order 12333, to investigate potential terrorist threats.  It also limits the role of the National Counterterrorism Center, or NCTC.
