I have to suggest that the Chinese government is at least as successful in manufacturing as the United States is in manufacturing automobiles, and that has been their strategy all along.  When they were trying to sell SUVs in the 1980's, the market for American cars and light trucks was basically closed to the Chinese, and I will use the example of the Ford model.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Miller substitute amendment to H.R. 2202 to provide $2 million to help make better use of the State and local tax deduction available to all taxpayers by both the Federal and State tax bases.  While tax relief is obviously of paramount importance to the Federal Government, the tax law that is already on the books for this generation should be broadly applicable to the next generation as well. To make it more likely that taxpayers will pay their fair share of taxes, this House should be enacting legislation to make tax provisions similar to the 1986 tax legislation permanent, rather than retroactively extending them to the future generation

It is the result of a bipartisan amendment that we had in the committee to the authorization for the Senate bill because the President had asked for this Congress to pass an authorization bill for his fiscal year 2006 budget to pay for military reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan. We asked the President to give us the authorization for the funding we requested to implement those activities so that if the resolution that was passed by the Senate did not come to the floor, we could get that to the House for a vote.

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend from Pennsylvania. This amendment would permit the number of judges to be limited to one from each of the major judicial districts in the United States of America. There is no reason to think that those communities which have the most Federal judges and judges of their States would not have some of the greatest need of Federal judges. In the great State of Pennsylvania we have one of the Nation's most highly educated and the most well qualified judges in the country. But, it seems to me that in many ways the practice

Thanks to the country of China, the top two AI companies, Google and Microsoft, have both committed $1 billion to our country in research and development.  But the battle over our AI is not with the Chinese, or the Russians or the Germans.

There are so many problems with this constitutional amendment. I will be addressing some of them in this order.  First, the big picture. Under the balanced budget amendment, the Federal Government could spend anywhere it wanted to increase the Federal deficit over the next 6 years. This would be in violation of the constitutionally mandated President veto. If Congress authorized this spending increase, it would have to raise taxes, spend more money, raise interest rates, and interest costs the

Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act because it is time for Congress to step back and take a fresh look at how Congress is spending taxpayer dollars on Federal programs and what it does to our States and local taxpayers and what it does to the taxpayers themselves. This is especially important in this day and age when this Congress continues to budget and taxes so much money out of the taxpayer's pocket without letting them know how it is being spent. The bill before us is no exception. It actually increases spending on a portion of entitlement programs appropriated under President Bush's tax cuts. Our budget proposal would increase spending for Medicaid at

The Republicans in this House are committed to keeping the promise that Medicare is part of the American Dream and is of national significance.

As Chairman Kerry has said, Congress has only a few months left in which to debate and vote on this legislation. The Senate is now spending the last 4 months debating trade adjustment assistance, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. It is time for Congress to say enough is enough. The taxpayers of this country do not want the Government deficit to be $50 billion a year.  I believe we can get a massive cut in this program by passing legislation such as this: Senators Rockefeller, Dorgan, Dayton, Levin, Graham
