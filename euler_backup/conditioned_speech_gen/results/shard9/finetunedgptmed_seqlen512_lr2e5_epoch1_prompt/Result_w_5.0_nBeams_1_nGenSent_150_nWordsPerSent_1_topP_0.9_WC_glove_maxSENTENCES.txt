Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee how much we would need to have in this bill to sustain what we have just heard about the fact that we have to have these new ships to be able to buy the ones we need. It is a question I have been asking all week long as I have been trying to get some answers to that question. For the record, the questions I have had from both sides have been the same: How much money is required to sustain this program and what kind of money is necessary to be able to buy the ships we are talking about this afternoon and to complete this program as soon as possible? That is what the Senator from North Carolina is asking us to do on the floor of the Senate.  How much is required in this bill to sustain the program

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of The Keystone XL Pipeline Act. The pending United States Government-wide ban on this oil-efficient energy infrastructure has had a disastrous effect on our economy. But more than that, the supporters of the policy have added insult to injury by alienating hundreds of thousands of Americans who rely on the Keystone pipeline for their health and safety.  This bill would establish a plan to implement the mandates of the United States-Mexico-Canada Energy Security Agreement.  We need to act quickly to ensure that we don't continue to encourage domestic oil production to continue to threaten our Nation's competitiveness and to continue to threaten the health of our citizens and all Americans.

As the chair of the Science Subcommittee of the Committee on Science, it is unfortunate that we are unable to move forward on the full authorization of this subcommittee which has been a long time coming. Our subcommittee has been mandated to bring the bill to the floor as soon as possible this year, and I hope we can get to work this year. I will also, however, address the amendment that will be

Mr. Speaker, I think it is ironic that I am on the opposite side of this House of Representatives from the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Environmental and Public Works and other Members of this House that voted for the environment package that you just voted for and we then said let us get rid of, and now I am left standing on the floor just to go to the proper place to vote on the clean water and the quality of our drinking water and the agriculture bill, and we have to keep saying to the public back home and also to the Senator from Texas, does not that really make sense?  Its not that they cannot tell the States to do their thing. We have taken some decisions already on the back of the head of the President on how to proceed on the plan to reform the Clean Water Act, and we are

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support for the Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Act of 2006. This legislation will strengthen protections for migratory birds and the opportunities for bird watching and bird conservation, in addition to developing necessary national programs to protect birds.  The concern for bird populations that has increased is one that has far-reaching implications for hunters and fish and wildlife officials, the various bird counties and hunting and fishing communities, as well as conservation groups and environmental groups and others involved in conservation efforts for birds and resources.  Because we must preserve wildlife for future generations, the public is more and more concerned about the health of our bird species. The most urgent wildlife conservation program for the general public and the hunting and fishing community is the habitat conservation program for our birds and other wildlife dependent on this habitat.  It is not

I agree with my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma. I do not want the people in Oklahoma to be served by this. My only question is what the country thinks is in the best interest of the United States. I would like the U.S. Department of Energy to release all information it has collected since 1987 when it was first created in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It has been about 45 years now since the creation of the Energy Information Agency. Since the creation of that agency, it has collected over $14 billion in fees and charges since its creation. In 1993, the Energy Information Agency paid over $8 billion in fees and charges to the Government of the United States of America and provided it with nearly $23 billion in the first two years of its existence. This is an agency which has been getting more and more of

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation which I would like to commend and commend the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Beilenson]. I would also like to thank my good friend from the State of Washington who has been very active in this area and has led this effort in getting this legislation passed and the permanent continuation of this program in the next year or two.  Mr. Chairman, this program has been around for 30 years. Over the past 30 years it has grown tremendously and has become one of the most important programs in many of our communities.  The author of this legislation was the one who got the idea to start this 20-year historic program. It has grown dramatically over the past few years, and there has been great help provided by the

Mr. President, I, too, would like to echo the comments by Senator Collins and Senator Campbell last week when they spoke about the need for more States to get this up and running so that they can deal with the new requirements in the new law that would require new information for certain very costly and very risky circumstances.  There are few provisions in this legislation that could not be improved by just adding a little more time to this bill to get this up and running before the summer months come and go. As a practical matter of fact, it would be almost as if we did not have a bill this year at all to fix this problem, because we have not got a bill at all because we have not put anything in place for 10 months since the House did not take it up before October 30 of this year.  I ask unanimous consent

Madam President, this amendment would significantly improve upon the current section 635 of S. 343, the Civil Rights of Lawful Permanent Residents Act of 1995 amendment, which would prohibit the Department of State from accepting government funds for a foreign policy organization based in the United States that does not comply with all of the State Department's public policy standards regarding the promotion of human rights and tolerance for human dignity in its own territory. The amendment is modeled on the provisions of section 635 of the legislation that apply to the political and diplomatic operations of the United Nations under article 42 of the United Nations Charter. It should be noted that the provisions of the amendment should not be used to prevent or restrict the Department of State from cooperating with the Department of State in other matters related to United Nations' activities or operations abroad. These provisions apply only to United Nations activities and

Mr. President, along with Senator Brownback, Senator Kennedy, and others, I rise today in support of the bipartisan agreement to extend important but nonessential Federal assistance to States for fiscal year 1996 and beyond. This agreement will put the U.S. Government on the same footing as other nations that have passed very similar agreements to help our Nation in its time of need. I am pleased to be a part of this conference agreement and join with my colleagues in the House and Senate in a very strong statement of support for our Nation in this very difficult and difficult time in our world and in America's history. It is important to point out that this agreement does not overstep the territorial limits of the United States, which means it would not prevent many vital domestic programs from funding in spite of how our country has contributed to the relief efforts in which we find

Mr. President, I ask that it be submitted to the Record that I inadvertently missed the vote yesterday on the Dole-Levin amendment No. 5883, and I am sorry to be late in that voting, but I do not think I missed the vote and I request that the Record reflect that.  The 778 to 4 vote was in opposition to the Dole amendment. It was the passage of the relevant appropriations bill by the body, and that vote should be noted here today.  The  turbulent local issue that has been ruffled in several cities with terrorist bombings was successfully resolved at the end of last Congress with the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, and that authorization should be cited.  The legislation that passed by the House addressed an amendment I submitted to the national defense authorization bill. The amendment
