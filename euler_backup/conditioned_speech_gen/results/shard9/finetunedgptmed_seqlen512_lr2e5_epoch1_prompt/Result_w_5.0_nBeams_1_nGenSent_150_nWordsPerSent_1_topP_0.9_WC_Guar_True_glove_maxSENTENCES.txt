This amendment encourages two specific classes of government to retain the remaining market share in environmental protection research by limiting the growth of Federal support to only one agency that will control most of the government- consume research in this area.

Additionally, I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his steadfast leadership on backlog issues and the district revolving fund.

Madam President, this amendment would significantly improve upon the current section 635 of S. 343, the Government Support Act Amendments of 1995. In addition to increasing protection of the rights of citizens against direct government action that the Public Interest Advocacy and Democracy Fund would hope to ban, this amendment has other positive impacts on other civil liberties areas which should be improved upon in future versions of this bill.  It would eliminate civil lawsuits in tort actions brought under Federal or State law, and it would eliminate a provision of the act that prevents court liability for the Federal Government for the enforcement of many of its regulatory laws. It would also change the due process exemption contained in section 635, so that an agency employee or agent who removes in good faith an object in violation of the law will not be liable under section 635 for the loss of the object.

Specifically, the amendment will do two things. First, it would allow employees to recover more for the total amount of time they have worked than they otherwise would have been entitled to under their employment period compensation in a claim for pay or vacation.  Second, it would raise the employee's statutory deduction from its current level of $8,600 to $13,000 per year. As we all know, payroll taxes are now assessed against all of an employee's wages over $29,000. While we in this Chamber have decided that any worker whose gross annual earnings exceed the $30,000 level shall not benefit from the refundable surtax--this legislation ensures that employees are given an effective deduction for the fair value of their time and effort, making their original payments go a little further.

Unfortunately, we have no congressional budget process to ensure that poor families do not suffer under these budget cuts to seniors or low-income families do not suffer because balanced budgets will not allow seniors to afford prescription drugs.  House Democrats have worked long and hard to ensure that Congress does not try to choose the speaker, the chairman or the majority leader in the House. We have tried to ensure that money for education, medical research, and Medicare would not go to a party that has not voted for a balanced budget plan.

Mr. President, I am honored to address the Senate in celebration of the 185th anniversary of the birth of President Theodore Roosevelt. I rise in the Chamber of the United States Senate to pay tribute to an extraordinary man whose lasting contribution to the world was the development of the American welfare state and the foundation of the political system that under greece now dictates the way foreign aid operates.  Our Nation has been fortunate to witness the superb achievements of many remarkable people. Among the most famous are the Pope and his Orthodox Church in Constantinople. Pope Alexander VI took Constantinople Orthodox Constantinople Church Church Patriarchal headquarters, which was founded during his reign by Greek warlord Mamlouk. He moved the Orthodox Church to a sprawling palace built in 1509, and it became known as the Constantinople Palace. As the new Eastern Emperor declared that the Christian faith was the principal

This is a great chance to serve and represent the people of California in the House of Representatives in a very different manner than I have done so far this year because this is a distinct era in this body.  It is a wonderful opportunity to represent the people of California in the House, as it were. This is a very unique time and a unique opportunity for my colleagues, a very unique role in the United States Congress.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If the Republican budget proposal were to become law this year, the Republican budget would cut over $200 billion out of food assistance programs for America's poor. It would do so by slashing vital nutrition programs that direct nutrition to the needs of our children, people with disabilities, women, and men with disabilities.  The budget proposal would cut $146 billion out of the Food Stamp Program, the provision that helps our Nation's poor in their food insecurity. It would cut $28 billion out of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and cut it a third, cutting $48 billion. The budget proposal also proposes to cut $28 billion out of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDB), which supports low-income

Mr. President, I recently introduced two bills to correct a serious misallocation of our limited resources. The first bill, the Fair Treatment for Workers Act, would strike the policy of state and local governments to prohibit more than five hours of work for every day of the week and the State and local government may provide no more than 28 days of working time for the President of the United States and his family during the 1996 campaign period.  My second bill would correct the issue of date, a policy promulgated by the Clinton administration and the Council of Economic Advisers in 1984. The contract with work time policies, coupled with the November 1995 memorandum by Commerce Secretary Olver in which he spelled out what State and local governments must do to comply with the American Worker Act and the Labor Management Relations Act, has undermined federal and State labor policy and at

Let me underscore the point that, some 23 years ago, we did not have the option in Iraq to have two political leaders sit down and negotiate a political settlement in the Middle East in the days after the American troops left in 2003, when we were only in Iraq for about 10 weeks. At that time, the world looked at us as having been in the Middle East for a long time with no policy and we had had no military policy and no political resolution of the Middle East for the majority of the member states of NATO. It took time for American political thinking to catch up and for the United Nations, which is largely the responsibility of the United States, to bring to the negotiating table peace in the Middle East, but with a political settlement.  When we had the opportunity to sit down and

Nevertheless, we should not allow our profound reservations about the roles of Untied States forces to prevent us from undertaking the necessary, carefully-managed multinational operations to protect human life.

That amendment has been accepted by the committee by a vote of 31 to 0, and on this basis and on that basis the bill has been deemed to have been fully and fully considered and fully thought through.  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that the chairman has recognized that the concern that exists in this body, frankly, is the

But as Speaker Pelosi and President Trump have said, and I believe they are right as far as this is concerned and how this will be addressed at some point down the line, the managers of this bill have made substantial progress in meeting the standards set forth by the Senate.

Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to support this bill for many reasons, but one is the committee helped put the effort into getting this bill to the House floor. It has helped us in getting the Speaker to show his support for this very important piece of legislation. The manager's amendment ensures that we will have that assurance as we consider amendments to the bill.  Let me also thank Chairman Bass, Senator Domenici, and the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Hollings, for working with me to include language in the authorizing conference report that would make revisions to the Flood Insurance Reform Act, WRDA. For those of my colleagues who may not be familiar with this, this legislation will reauthorize what has been known as the ``clean water law'' for 3 years. It passed in 1997, but it expired

The National Academy of Sciences has said in the Energy and Power Budget Committee that for this Nation to have its great power come from our natural resources we must continue to realize the economic benefits that flow from the public lands that we have been talking about today, that that Federal Government lands make up one of the most effective means of State and local economies.  I think that the economic and tax-payer advantages we have seen today, because of our people who take our land for recreation, in so many cases, in so many different parts of the Nation, is what allowed us to provide some of the most dramatic tax reductions in American history, the reductions in taxes that were very important in the 1950's

Yes. The way the insurance premium caps would be is, I guess there is an infinite amount of money that you could spend to offset that if you wanted to do it this way. We cannot be able to say to an employer what their health insurance costs are going to be because we cannot ask for that information because we cannot answer it, we cannot ask them how they are going to cover health care costs, so we cannot try to figure that out from a cost estimate that would cost us $200 to recover that amount. That would mean that, instead of the government getting the information in its hands, the insurance companies and the doctors and the patients kidney, if they are going to come up with $200, as we say on this floor, to cover the cost of health insurance, that would come from the taxpayers and from them

Senator Conrad has been very much involved on this side of the aisle on this matter and on other matters in his committee that deal with other country and economic issues in this Nation that would be brought under President Clinton's watch, if we do pass this bill and pass it in the Senate.  I agree with the Senator that the impropriety occurred in the Senate--in particular, in having an amendment that you all sponsored and Senator Domenici and I sponsored and Senator McCain sponsored. It is perfectly clear. If that was the matter before the Senate, there would be no impropriety because if

Mr. President, the Contracted Training Flight Services Program was instituted 10 years ago because the Federal Aviation Administration needed better communications for its pilots to make safety decisions. By 2006 there had been nearly 20,000 calls to the Federal Aviation Administration from pilots who needed to be told when and how the President's call for short-takeoffs and high-risk T-5 operations could be accelerated.  The program was extraordinarily effective at reducing the amount of material flying in excess of 150 tons and stockpile stockpiles. It was intended to enable the Air Force to adjust the decisions for flights in excess of 25,000 pounds. In 2008, it was implemented and--just last year--the use of the program to operate commercial flights in excess of 150 tons was expanded.

It was passed over 400 days ago with a supermajority and very little debate, and now President Trump is threatening to pay insurers to cover every person who wants to have coverage who does not have it who has an accident or who has a family member who does not have insurance and who has a family member who has been injured because he was having his son son fatherly's cancer.  So the Republican leadership is determined to impose this flawed legislation again. Why? They want to steal what they want and spend the money of the American taxpayers to do it, and now they are telling President Trump that if he signs this bill, he will have to live under the same laws that millions of Americans have to live under to get

I know that my good friend from Michigan has been a strong, steady force in support of welfare reform because the jobs of the future depend on it. It is for this reason that we will be working hard in this Congress to keep welfare as economy and welfare, a significant spending subject of our discussion, and it is very important that we remain as united as we were in the early 1980's.

Mr. President, that is right. Mr. President, again I encourage our colleagues to focus on the issues which we have before us and come together as a Senate and move this bill forward in a bipartisan fashion to address issues we have that we have worked on together for months and months and months and months and months and months. That is why I urge colleagues to bring amendments. But to my colleagues who are going to talk about having unanimous consent and all that kind of thing because we have not been able to get consideration of this bill and if we cannot bring the bill to the floor for a vote on the other side of the aisle without not having a absence of any Democratic amendments, I say: You don't understand the importance of that and why we should have an opportunity to do that.

Mr. Speaker, on the floor this week I criticized the baggage-of-appearance problems surrounding the appointment of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States. I criticized this because at the same time there are reports that at least five women who have accused him of sexual misconduct have chosen not to pursue legal action because of political pressures. I said this for the same reason I criticized this accusation in January of this year when this floor was as busy as it is today, when the allegations against Donald Trump reached new heights.  I said it then because I still believe it. President Trump does not deserve to be America's President. No one who comes before us would dare to appoint someone who could be described as a sexual predator.

We have a number of statements already made that justify that conclusion.  The argument that Senators on the other side of the aisle want a Government shutdown goes something like this: Congress should not have to come to an agreement that would delay Federal work on key Federal accounts that the Federal Government cannot even begin testimony and debate about, let alone do. They also argue that Congress should not have to tell the people that work is coming to a halt earnestly because Republicans are in charge. There are those on the other side of the aisle who share this desire, and they do so in much more eloquent and eloquent ways.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. There are a number of substantive improvements that have been made in the underlying legislation which address many of the concerns I have been seeking to address on this side of the aisle. The only substantive difference in this bill is the addition of a new education appropriations formula which forces States to spend more on a program that is States' responsibility while States are given the states of the United States to determine the level of funding they should provide to that State program. That would force us to accept the idea that our States should have more control over how they spend their money and how they protect Iraqi children.  The balanced budget amendment changes nothing in the underlying bill.  I think the amendment does something worthwhile, but I strongly oppose the amendment.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

That is correct. I don't support the specific definition of access.

Mr. President, under Title 8 of the U.S. Code, a number of criminal offenses are crimes against a child under the criminal laws of the State where the offense is committed and subject to prosecution in that State or jurisdiction in the same manner as a misdemeanor or felony crime against a person under that criminal law of the State for the conviction thereof or other similar offense, if that offense involves the use or threatened use of physical force against a child which the use or threat of physical force would cause that order of action to be barred by any State or local ordinance, State or local law.  The Crime Victims Rights Act of 1996 rectifies this situation in two important ways. First, it imposes a criminal civil sanction on a criminal defendant who uses or threatens physical force against a child, provided that the force used is not part of or in furtherance

He would not say that there is anything in our budget to help that because he did not have any tax increases to pay for it.

Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment. This amendment would replace a key feature of the President's budget with an administration proposal to increase spending on essential government programs only for political purposes. This proposal would require that the mandatory spending account be increased for Federal education programs only if the increase in the level of funding would increase the deficit or increase the cost to the Federal Government. That would undermine the principle of transparency proposed in the McCain amendment proposed to oppose the administration's budget request to spend more on the federal government than it takes in, thereby increasing the deficit and increasing the cost to the Federal Government. We need clarity and sound fiscal management.  The amendment also eliminates the Advanced Technology Vehicles and Industrial Base program, which funds research and development on advanced technologies to help the commercial and military sectors realize the potential of our Nation's strategic infrastructure.

Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and fellow Hoosier from Indiana for yielding this time to me.  Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the bill introduced by our House Republican leader to repeal the Medicare tax legislation. As one of the Republican States that has suffered the consequences of increased Medicare premiums for seniors, I would ask this House to vote to repeal this Medicare tax bill and to strengthen our seniors by providing them with real relief to encourage them to engage in the premium support activities that have enabled our Nation to become the envy of the world for the advancement of medicine and the science that underlies that progress.  Madam Speaker, the Republicans have brought to the floor a bill to repeal the so-called Medicare tax that only benefits the wealthy. This should be the first and last thing we do, or ever, to

Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor today. This bill is important for people of all ethnic groups in our country. It recognizes the significant contributions that the Korean War era has made to our Constitution and our civilization as a whole. It would reduce the amount of taxpayer funds available for transparency in Federal programs by providing greater fiscal transparency and accountability to the Korean Government and, importantly, to all groups that depend on our Government to provide meaningful and equal treatment.  By recognizing this important war in the Constitution, it authorizes Korean Americans to visit the halls of the U.S. Capitol Building for the purpose of commemorating the Korean War, while at the same time ensuring that the Korean Government honors the sacrifices made by the Korean Americans during the Korean War.

This agenda will bring the political process to Congress and House Speaker Gingrich for legislative reconciliation--repealing the ineffective and wasteful tax cut for the rich and cutting spending so we can pay for our defense.  House Republicans have promised us that if this attack on the Capitol's beloved IRS is a threat to our security, they will take immediate action, and then they will protect our constitutional rights to vote and to express our opinion.

It is estimated that drug use by professional athletes has increased fourfold during this period. Yet since the report was published, only 50 athletes have been indicted for violating drug testing laws. The next largest group are athletes using performance-enhancing drugs, responsible for one-half of the annual total.

Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Ryan White Reauthorization Act of 1995. This important legislation includes the necessary title I funds needed to fund a wide range of programs which are vital to the welfare system in this Nation. To be able to provide health care for the people of this country is certainly one of the most difficult tasks that a nation can put itself through because disease prevention, child nutrition programs, aids to self-sufficiency programs, adult AIDS prevention, and AIDS prevention programs are not immune to disease epidemic.  Mr. President, one of the elements of the welfare reform bill is to recognize the importance of the current system and the needed changes to enable this nation to remain economically and socially competitive in the 21st century. An economic stability program is needed so that our citizens can continue to provide a working and living environment for

If it came in a single bill, it would take $4 billion. If it comes in an omnibus bill, it would cost $8 billion. If it comes in the full CR, it would cost $25 billion. The Republican budget cuts $25 billion. So it is hard

This amendment will provide an additional $2 million for the arts, a huge amount for New York City, but in the greater area of the city the increase is certainly very small.

This law was passed in 1975 and is most well known in terms of the degree of security which it effectively precludes from being used as a tool for malign enrichment.  I will repeat for the record how this spending increase is contained in the bill before us today. Under the bill that I am talking about, there is no additional appropriations for the line-item veto.

Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the recent passing of David Culp. He was a skilled, patriotic public servant who dedicated his life to public service and the citizens of the State of South Carolina and the United States of America. It was a national tragedy that he was not there to join the military to fight for our country. He also devoted his life to his church and community as a respected teacher at the Christian School in the North East of South Carolina and South Carolina Nuclear Community at the prestigious Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.  Following his service to our country in the United States Air Force and later to discuss a lecture he was to deliver at the Ohio Peace Institute in 1993, David Culp was awarded the Purple Heart. His service to our Nation and his deep commitment to service are worthy of commendation. He also will be

This means that if you can still make a living with your amputated foot, then you have another option to help the people of this country who are out there with foot surgery. We should continue to allow children that have that option and some that do not have that option to continue in the program. But to say that the funds that are used for assistance in health care has to be spent only on those that are most in need is not being very commonsensical to those affected by this legislation. Therefore it should not be restricted to just those with amputations, but those who have no experience or those who need more services, have that opportunity to continue to get help. This is about making sure that our economy and our communities function again. This amendment should have no problem whatsoever with this body.  I reserve the balance of my time

Since last year California has already faced the worst economic crisis in decades. Rising unemployment has hit most Californians hard. Much of California's water infrastructure, from cities to farms to refineries, and major groundwater pumping plants are a disaster waiting to happen.  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger announced in June that he would ask the federal government to enact a nine-year regulatory relief program that would provide three-quarters of the relief and reduce costs for the State by more than $300 million. In California alone, the Californians can expect over $20 billion in additional economic stimulus funds.

This legislation before the Senate is the product of months of hard work on both sides of the aisle in a bipartisan manner that is something that should be considered by the Congress of the United States again in January 1997 and again in February 1997 to October 1998 when October 1998 may be December 1998 in April 1998 in October 1998 April 1998 October 1998 October 1998 November 1998 November 1998 November 1998 November 1998 October 1998 November 1998 November 1998 November 1998 November 1998 October February February September March October November June August September July September July September October November August August September October November October November November February July crude oil, 52,487,145 barrel;  1,746,293,345 barrel of diesel fuel--combined--18,222,038,873 barrels--

Mr. Chairman, it is time to stop this Federal subsidy of a crop that is suffering severe damage in the Midwest because of its competition in the international marketplace. It is time to say that we cannot continue to pay $600 million to a company that is directly responsible for cancer deaths in an industry that cannot afford to pay this amount. It is time to say no to the money that we will have to send overseas for domestic use for airline security. It is time to say no to the Government of the United States paying more than $3 million in conference committee committee chairman expense allowance for assistance with the Ex-Im Bank. It is time to say no to these additional taxpayers dollars.

The  chemistry of innovation is an important and efficient method to market highly complex and complex chemicals, providing a unique opportunity to produce innovative product types at the lowest possible cost. According to the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, the current manufacturing regime in China allows it to manufacture less than 20 percent of the quality of high-performance chemistry and additive chemicals produced by U.S. industry. This demonstrates a government-driven disincentive to invest in our Nation's research

Mr. Speaker, S. 162 is a bill that reauthorizes the Indian Health Service as well as the Department of the Interior and the United States Forest Service and would help further Indian health issues in the Lowcountry by authorizing additional $4 million for improved health assessments and capacity building activities for the Pomo to Pomo tribe of New York.  The bill would yield approximately $2.5 million to the Pomo to Pomo Indian Health Service for financial assistance to improve quality of care for the tribe's tribal members and employees. Additionally, the bill would provide $2 million for the Pomo to Pomo Indian Health Service to provide for the performance of immunizations for tribal members and employees and establish a consultation program with the tribe's health care provider in order to improve the health

Mr. Speaker, last October I thought that it was absolutely necessary to disarm Saddam Hussein. President Bush assured the American people that he would make an honest man of him. If it was not true that we had no option but to resort to force to bring about disarmament, the rest is not so absolutely true.  Well, Mr. Speaker, the mission of the American people is to lead the world to freedom and peace. I can understand President Bush's attempt to move us toward peace if the opposition to the peace would simply shut up. Unfortunately, that approach did not convince our friend and ally, Saddam Hussein.
