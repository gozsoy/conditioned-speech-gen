Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee a question regarding the Navy's F/A-18 program. It has been suggested that we should put some of the problems associated with the so-called A/D/E number in the cost estimate of the Navy. I believe that should be the case and as chairman of subcommittee, I agree. I am not a proponent of taking off the A/D/E numbers. I know they are not meant to be determined by the authorizing committee, nor should they be. But a point should be made that it is not always the case that the defense authorization bill will include all or part of a cost estimate, even if that requirement is not complete.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an outstanding community in Indiana's Eighth Congressional District. It is no secret that the Hoosier State has the longest and most extensive manufacturing sector in the Nation. Indiana has two major manufacturing companies that make both vehicle and aircraft engines and major components of both of these products that are used in our Nation's commercial airplane industry and the largest auto assembly assembly plant in the world. The leader in these industries is Chrysler and GM. Since the end of World War II, Chrysler has made important investments in technical research and manufacturing at various sites in Indianapolis and at the Cannon plant in Becton, Indiana.  The Hoosier team at Chrysler recently completed a multimillion-dollar plan to create the plant's 50th new jobs. This expansion will in turn result in the creation of 1,600 additional jobs, with thousands of Indiana residents also expected to become part of this new job creation. There is also

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of The Keystone XL Pipeline Act. The Keystone Pipeline represents a critical asset in our efforts to secure energy independence for America. The passage of this act will enable us to meet the growing demand for energy that America faces. By connecting oil and natural gas pipelines across the United States, we will be able to add to the already over 100,000 jobs in the Keystone industry. Moreover, it will enhance the strength of our economy and spruce up the environmental landscape.  Today, the State of Michigan is an energy hub in our country, providing 34 percent of our Nation's electricity. This 20 percent growth has resulted in an increase in our State's production of gasoline. Within the last year, gas prices have dropped 7 percent. That is especially important in our State where our people need the products from our oil infrastructure more than ever. We must move towards an energy security that will benefit all of

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and many others, as an original cosponsor of this bipartisan amendment to the resolution that is before the Senate today to honor Israel for the freedom it has long provided peace-loving Palestinians around the world.  On Sunday Israel decided to go on peace talks with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, a step that may affect the Palestinian Authority peace negotiations scheduled for this week. Israel also agreed to begin Israeli-Palestinian economic cooperation for the first time since 1985. In return, Hamas agreed to end its attacks against Israel in exchange for what it called the transfer of 8,000 confiscated Israeli West Bank settlers that it did not yet have.  The amendment before the Senate today, Mr. President, adds another important element to this ongoing agreement. This amendment authorizes the President to speak to the U.N.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment encourages two of the worst features of Washington bureaucracy. First, it gives the executive branch control over job creation programs to eliminate incentives for private sector job creation and encourage government regulation. This amendment also gives Washington bureaucrats control over whether the American taxpayer will bear the burdens of the Federal Government through a higher spending economy.  We are talking about Washington bureaucrats running an economy now that is stagnant and designed to encourage a decline in job creation in America. Mr. Chairman, Congress cannot continue to allow Washington bureaucrats to develop and keep to the same old programs that have done so much harm to our economy.  These two programs, the Small Business Administration and the Small Business Innovation Research Program, are essential to the economy of America. The difference between the two programs is that the SBA promotes innovation, while SBIR promotes job creation. I think we should offer an amendment saying to the

Mr. Chairman, that is correct.

EPA did a great job in this way and over the last decade has increased its oil emissions in our country by more than 70 percent, and it was a good thing then. We need to do a better job for the future in the area of clean air, clean water, and the environment.

Greece has enjoyed the rich history of democracy throughout history. From ancient times to the Ottoman Empire, Greece was a representative democracy. The extraordinary political and social achievements of the ancient Greek world should be a source of pride for the United States Congress. However, Mr Speaker, in recent years many have chosen to spread lies about Greece and to dismiss its role in history. Let me just read a few from the ``Washington Times.''

Mr. President, I would first like to thank my distinguished colleagues, the Chairman, Senator Stevens and Ranking Member Senator Byrd for addressing the issue of how to reform the pay-for bill to make it more competitive for the private sector and for the federal government and for the private sector to be able to use that as a powerful tool for reform that is critical for the Members of this body to make this House of Representatives and to this Senate and to this President. Senator Byrd and I will be offering an amendment on the floor later in this session that will help speed up this process and make it more favorable for the private sector, for the private sector to be able to get into the market faster, cheaper, and with a larger percentage of taxpayers' money. That is why we are introducing it today.  The pay-for bill is the bill in the middle of the American business cycle. Business cycle is the period during which there is some movement

Mr. Speaker, U.S. Border Agent Luis Aguilar, Jr. was on patrol in January on the Arizona border chasing two vehicles of suspected drug dealers. As Agent Aguilar pursued the vehicles, he was allegedly attacked by two men in a pickup truck. Agents Aguilar and another member of the border patrol were injured in the attack and later died of their injuries. One of those suspected of the attack was later killed in a firefight that followed a firefight between the two dealers.  Many Border Patrol agents believe these attacks and others such as the one in Phoenix to be the result of conspiracy theories and fear fueled paranoia. It is a full 2 months since our two agents, Sergeant Javier Whittington and Border Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar, Jr., have been gunned down.  They were out hunting drugs, working to stop the flow of drugs into the United States, and serving their communities as Border Patrol agents.  Today we pay tribute to all of

While I know the gentleman from Florida, our previous speaker, is a supporter of immigration enforcement and law enforcement, he is also a staunch champion of the human rights of human beings and what it means to be a human being in this country.

Specifically, the amendment will do two things. First, it would allow employees to recover more of the back pay or other compensation that is owed to them by the employer through overtime if it is paid in lieu of wages. In other words, the amendment would require that employers and employees both pay the back pay in lieu of wages owed to them under section 511 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 if the employee owes more than 10 percent of that employer-paid employee's retiree compensation in the form of money or other thing of value due to overtime or the purchase of additional benefits due to the overtime payment in bankruptcy.  The second thing the amendment would do is to fix the employment-based incentive provisions of the present law that have a little bit of a wink and a nod to employers, but very clearly send a signal that the deduction of the wage, back pay, and benefits owed to the employee through overtime will be used to offset

I think one of the key lessons that we want is, we want Americans to have health insurance as good as a Congressman, but we also want to be able to afford it and keep it good. The reason the law gives insurance companies the option of providing health insurance to employees is so that they can compete fairly in the marketplace in offering affordable insurance for their employees in the same way as they compete in other places in America where there is competition in other areas of health care. There is a Pennsylvania issue, however, that I have some concerns about, something that is currently being pursued by the President and in a sense could be a problem.

Let me use some of the time for the issue at hand. First of all, I wish to talk about the technical corrections bill that we will be considering in the coming weeks. This bill is needed to ensure funding is not misused and that needs should be addressed, in my opinion, before amendments are made to it. I want to assure my colleagues that this is the correct process to use to address the authorization of the appropriation.  First, Mr. Speaker, there are some technical changes made to the authorization in this bill. These changes, which were agreed upon on both sides of the aisle when the conference committee came to the floor to put the bill together, simply allow the committee to operate with a regular budget for the year in the event of a default. They are not the final bill, but they do help keep a manageable budget for the overall appropriation and serve as a step in the process in order to guarantee a smooth

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3624, the Outsourcing Accountability Act of 2008. This legislation would require an American company that is outsourcing its products or services to foreign countries to submit a written certification of its economic trade status for one year before it can proceed. The certification must also include the name of the member or citizens of the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, or Singapore the company is outsourcing to, and an explanation of the benefits it will provide American consumers. In addition, the certification must describe the trade secrets the company has developed or acquired to meet the needs of the American consumer.  This bill was introduced by Representatives Frank Pallone of New Jersey and Rodney Frelinghuysen of Pennsylvania. It was championed by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich) and others, and I commend him for his efforts. This bill will help protect

Mr. President, the two distinguished Senators from Idaho who have the sense-of-the-Senate resolution in at this point as an amendment need to work this matter out, otherwise the amendment would be dead. But I would be happy to accept the amendment and then take the distinguished Senator's amendment to the House of Representatives as an amendment.  The  snug action by the House of Representatives for more resolution on this matter, which is what is so unfortunate about the situation we are in today, is a reason why the unanimous consent request made in order at that time of the Democratic leader in that House. The presence of the President's chief of staff and some of his party appointees in a Government building in a world where communication has been slowed down by the White House is a conspicuous violation of House rules.

This initiative is in response to an electricity and natural gas shortage in the State of Washington, and this initiative is implemented by three existing public power utilities in fiscal year 2010. This initiative, initiated by the utilities in fiscal year 2010, is aimed at encouraging the generation and use of more energy from coal-fired generation, and this is exactly the kind of strategy that should be included in the energy and water bill we will be considering this summer, Mr. Chairman.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, I am honored to address the Senate in celebration of the 185th anniversary of Greek independence. On March 25, 1821, the Greeks revolted from the Ottoman Empire to establish their own state and declared themselves the Republic of Greece. A few months later the Greek people were awarded the honor of emulating the English monarchy by adopting the Constitution of the United States.  Today, Greece, as it was when Greek colonists occupied the Holy Land, is a vibrant, vibrant country that enjoys a vibrant democracy, which includes the Greek Orthodox Church and Orthodox Patriarchate. The people of Greece have acted admirably and with honor in the face of adversity as they strive for one final better future for themselves and for their communities.  I would like to join with my colleague, Senator Shelby, in commemorating the 185th anniversary of Greek independence.

If we had the same conditions and if this body had the same rules that we had in the Committee on Rules in 1992 that we had in Connecticut in 1994, we would not be seeing the bill today.

There are really two questions that this bill raises in the Democrat majority and the Republicans which I think are very important that they answer for themselves now and to which the question must be put as to whether or not we plan to have this at all. The answer to that is clearly ``no'' because we are concerned about the more than $100 billion added to the debt as result of this bill that will yield a tax increase on every American citizen.  So the tax increase that this bill introduces is going to add $100 billion to the debt in Vermont, Illinois, North Carolina, Kentucky, Florida, North Dakota, Nebraska, Virginia, Oregon, and Washington State, creating an entirely new and tax-and-spend entitlement program.

Just as the Senate should not forget the September 11 terrorist attacks, this Congress must remain focused on reducing Iran's nuclear capability. And Iran is not only a threat to the United States but to the Middle East as well.  As one of many of my colleagues, I am heartened by recent statements by President Obama that Iran is open to the possibility of a nuclear weapons

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1055 to grant the Congressional Gold Medal to the 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team from the United States Army. The Congressional Gold Medal is the Nation's highest civilian honor awarded to Active-Duty personnel for conspicuous gallantry in the performance of duty.  On November 22, 1945, at approximately 2:20 a.m., following a heavy cavalry charge against the German held Prussian village of Rajkowski, the American troops were attacked on their position. The attack, first reported by three cavalry officers, was a 1-hour intense fire fight. The brigade mounted 2 large and 1 medium howitzers in rapid succession in heavy German firing. Despite intense enemy fire and efforts by company level officers to direct his own firing to down several enemy assault rifleman positions, the top turret of the 101st Armored Company was the target. Private First Class David R. Burns drove

Mr. President, let me briefly respond. I know the point of order has been made. A motion has been made to waive the Budget Act. That was a unanimous vote. So I believe Senator Byrd's motion is the appropriate course of action to take. And I believe if there is a budget agreement in the future, it is the constitutional duty of the Senate to be the decision maker on spending matters--this is not a bill that just happens to come to the floor; it is a bill that is the responsibility of the majority of this body--it is something that must be discussed and resolved in the context of a budget agreement so that we can go forward with those things that the American people want us to do. So I understand the frustration of the Senator from Missouri.  So the point of order is a fine one. I believe it would be unwise for the majority leader to seek to take this action, so I am prepared to

For Speaker Ryan and the new majority, the vision of a more open and accessible Federal Government is precisely the opposite of the direction of the country and what the American people want from Congress in general.  We were all told that without a significant reduction in the size, scope, and power of Washington, the spending and regulatory burden, the government itself would take on too many of the functions of other government and stifle economic growth.  Mr. Speaker, just like the President, the Speaker claimed that he supported an ``economic package'' because he believed in small business and cutting taxes. But let's just be clear: Ryan budget deficits were very low. They were smaller than expected. And, the growth rate, too, was little changed

Madam President, on Wednesday, the administration made a decision to oppose the University of Michigan's efforts to promote diversity on the campus. In making the decision to oppose the university on this issue, the administration cited concerns about supporting affirmative action policies that increase the student body of students of all economic classes and that will reduce the possibility that minority students will be able to participate fully in the university.  The President supports diversity policies. He supports fair treatment for all students and all applicants for admission to higher education. Unfortunately, the administration has made it abundantly clear that it will not support affirmative action policies that would have the desired effect.  It is important to understand why this is so. Although university administrations have historically supported affirmative action policies, not all students will benefit in the long run. In fact, the median income for African Americans attending a 4-year college is 15 percent lower than that of the median income of all students. At this time, students

So our increase in economic activity now is actually taking place at a lower rate than the economic activity that would have occurred had we left welfare as it existed. That is consistent with the claim that was made yesterday by our colleague from Indiana.

Mr. President, as I listen to the debate tonight about Section 222, which invades the privacy rights of taxpayers, I would like to point out that this bill is not about Congress intervening in the private property laws of the citizens of the State of New York or Florida or Idaho. This is not about a private property issue in the State of New York or Florida or Idaho. This is about taxpayers and taxpayers' rights being put to the protection of tax dollars. Finance is central to making good policy in this country and we should not misuse this avenue. If it is the right thing to do for a good policy, we should do it, but, if not, we should not do it.  Section 222, if enacted, creates a new, unaccountable private property protection agency, the National Taxpayer Advocate, a private entity, for taxpayers in all 50 States. The bill authorizes the use of taxpayer money for this new agency, unless

Madam President, the high cost of gasoline has had a crippling effect on the economy of my State of Mississippi. The people in my State, the people of America are losing their cars and their families are losing their health care because prices are too high. But the people of my State of Mississippi are losing their jobs because too many people have been put out of work because of high prices and not enough Americans have been educated so that they can move up the wages of American workers. That is what is causing their problems.  When I was elected to the Senate in 1999, the unemployment rate in my State of Mississippi was 7 percent, and that is where we should be now. People across this great country, people of Mississippi and people of every State in the Union, are having trouble affording the energy we need to run our businesses and to maintain our infrastructure. It is true that we cannot be proud of the job we are doing, but

The young soldiers who served and fought in the European theater of the war received their high school education by attending Freedom Hall.  One of the purposes of Freedom Hall was to coordinate the educational plans of young men and women who were serving in the European theater of the war. When they got home, they discussed what was being done for them. Once they learned what it was being done, they called, and we called the parent organization with the problem, and the problem was, the parents were struggling to deal with the problems that these young Americans were facing.

The decision to send U.S. forces to Bosnia is deeply troubling, but I remain convinced that all sides in Bosnia must be willing to make a real peace agreement.

I believe that he would be very sympathetic to any of the amendments that we might consider and would be willing to work with us in a bipartisan way to address the post 9/11 issues that are being raised here today. <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

That message is, these people don't matter. The only thing that matters is the gun lobby. That would be a terrible message to send. I think gun ownership is really the most important issue. I just wish we would work it out and get some bipartisan support here in this House so we can get this done. I think this would really be awful terrible for the Second Amendment and the rest of the American people, in particular in the Second District of Illinois. The longer we wait to do this, the less likely it will be that this will actually be worked out and pass this House for remainder of the year.  The motion to recommit is pretty straightforward. The Members of the Senate--I do not think there is a committee that represents more of the private sector and is more interested in providing the most fair and a level playing field for the private sector than the Committee on Rules. We're not exactly talking in simple numbers on here.

He brought things to the very people he loved and he brought them to this institution.

My friend from California continually references this energy tax increase. He's very astute on the rules, Madam Speaker, and he knows that the way you fund energy production and exploration is to charge revenues to the Treasury. So the additional revenues created by that government mandate for the exploration and production and extraction of oil and gas from the public lands is an entitlement and must be continually provided to pay the expenses associated with that entitlement.  So the thing that's so astounding is that you find in this motion to recommit that they want to pay for some regulatory function which is going to be closed in some form in the sequester and that somehow the administrative process needs to be put back into place.

Mr. Speaker, there are good reasons that this House should come to a close and vote today for the August recess. Not only are the American people paying more for their products than they are spending for education or Social Security benefits in this country and for employment in this country, they are working harder than ever at jobs that Americans have had for over 200 years. The combination of the two as we approach a recession is not good. Americans need some time to absorb what is about to happen.  Unfortunately, the leader's resolution and the legislation that was passed in the last few weeks or months, the expiration of the tax cuts, the extension of the debt ceiling bill, will not provide the stability to the economy that the American people need.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3144, which will bring certainty to the management of the Federal Columbia River Power System. For years the Federal Power Commission has recommended that the public purchase an appropriate amount of fuel for the system. Unfortunately, this recommendation has not been made available to the public or the public-interest organizations that must utilize this excess fuel.  Congress is attempting to address this issue by introducing legislation which will give the public the option to purchase at $20 a year or at Speaker Pelosi's request $20.50 per month of used fuel to be used for the critical power generation needs of the Columbia River Power System, unlike the current Federal program which forces the public to use about $2,000 in excess fuel each year. This legislation will allow an individual to make the decision that, like the American people, he or she wants to pay more for the power that they need. In addition, Congress is creating

We are starting to see health care costs rise because of the choice and the flexibility of the health care policy that is in this bill.  The bill would cut Medicare spending by $2 billion over the next 5 years, putting the Congress in the position of having to make choices for our seniors as to whether they should go on the government plan or keep their current plans or not and whether they should stay on their current plan or go to some other option because they know they cannot continue to have these reasons.  Second, this bill is pure politics. It is a politically motivated attempt to demagogue this issue of Medicare.

Yes. The way the insurance premium caps would be is, I guess there is an assumption in there on the part of the administration that if you have an individual with $5 million under your policy but your policy is already maxed out and a policy limits the amount of time that you can be on it and the policies that provide that they cannot have any more than 10 years of policies in a plan that the administration plans to build and then the government has to purchase policies. Then the policy that has the $5 million will not be able to go up under the current structure that they are putting together with the alliance, and the insurers are taking on the burden of finding ways to get out of the unbalanced policies that they are doing now. We are going to see more and more of this sort of amendment. That is, we are trying to apply some common sense and prudence and restraint and ethical reform to health insurance reform.

In that instance, a loss of employment is put at risk and their life chances at starting a new career in the field of medicine could be goal.  Mr. President, is that what this bill is?

Madam Speaker, the challenge for all America, not just the new administration and Congress, but our communities, our businesses, especially American families, is how to create a community that works for all and which is secure for all and that helps everyone have the tools to succeed and succeed and succeed and succeed.  That is what we are doing here today on the Speaker's counterproposal and in the next hour and a half debate about whether to take us back to the Bush administration's failed health care law. We are debating whether we are going to offer America another chance for hope, opportunity, and action, and whether we are going to put the national security of the United States above the lives of American families.  Let us be clear: The largest single employer in my district is the St. Louis County Government. It is 75 percent owned and managed by the county government of St. Louis, the 22nd largest employer in the United States. I have

Madam Chair, just so we don't forget where we were, Colorado in August of 2008 had about a 4, 4\1/2\ percent unemployment rate. We had 2 million people unemployed for months at a time and we had seen a steady decline in the stock market. We had all these problems that we saw back in the Great Recession.  Now we are in a situation where all of a sudden we have seen a spike in the stock market. As the Chair has pointed out, the first quarter of 2009 lost $2.5 billion in the U.S. market. Last year, it lost $1.6 billion, and the third quarter of 2009 lost $2.6 billion.  In the spring of 2009, the Dow Jones fell 20 percent and the S&P lost $14 billion.  At the very same time, corporate America began, along with so many other industries, to invest more money in itself and jobs. They increased its

Madam Speaker, would it be wrong to propose an amendment that would ask that we add support for troops that will be in harm's way while they have the support of the American people and the civilian workforce that is also in the line of fire?

So I would hope we could find some way to discuss that with the people we want in the Foreign Affairs Committee, because we would be able to come up with a way to fund a very serious humanitarian effort, a humanitarian campaign.

As a matter of fact, there are some corrections to the bill, but I think there should be some appreciation that this is something that should be added. There was a proposal that was made to limit the unions to agreements that would contract for life. Well, if we cannot take the cost off the middleman and put some judgment on what is best for our workers, then maybe we should not do that, but let's just strike a balance.  I think

I say to the Senator from New York that is a process we do not want to go through again because it is going to make this a very difficult time for people if we do not have this debate for a week or so so because we need to move this bill to the floor and call up the pending amendments so that we can go into the Rules Committee and get their approval.

Over the past 75 years, the tunnel has been an important transportation link between the American and Canadian states and between the United States and Canada, and has been an important border crossing for many Canadian trade and transportation officials.  The Detroit Windsor Tunnel was designed in 1930 for use by workers crossing from the U.S. to Canada by means of a hoist. In the late 1930s, the U.S. Congress agreed to build a temporary transfer hoist from the Detroit River to the tunnel so that workers could direct traffic and move goods through the tunnel by hoisting the passageway. The project continued to be a priority of the U.S. Senate until 1994, when a planned Ohio replacement was canceled. The tunnel is only accessible by bicycle from Windsor's Union Station.

Mr. Speaker, do you remember when you were kids in school, and there was this big chart, and you learned how a bill becomes a law?

I think this President would be appalled by what is going on here.  We have tried every time to get a public financing of elections. We have tried every time to have the American people have an opportunity to have a larger debate on how we change the Federal Government, how we change the way we are perceived in America, how we improve the way we provide for the

Mr. President, I rise in response to my good friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, who obviously feels very passionately about the bill, as do I. I am a little confused by the comments he made about how we are going to get the tax relief we need to reduce the deficit and get this bill done and not have to face this Congress next year when the President will not make a good-faith effort to negotiate tax cuts for our people that are not revenues but revenues because the tax cuts of the past do not work for the revenue side of the budget business because they are revenue sales, not revenues produced, and my friends on the other side of the aisle want to pretend that the revenue side of the budget is more important.  Let us just deal with the revenue side. A part of that revenue bill deals with our agricultural producers because they are suffering economically and politically as a result of a $300 billion bailout from China, and it

Mr. President, the Contracted Training Flight Services Program was instituted 10 years ago because the Air Force and Air National Guard determined that civilian companies had not been able to provide and maintain high quality training flights in both the military and civilian program areas for many years and should receive the Federal Government's help in the provision of such services and the collection of this funds through the program established by Congress in Public Law 103-519 in the United States-India Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1991.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of continuing the funding for the Office of Technology Assessment [OTA] of the U.S. Congress. I believe that the OTA is critical to ensuring that our country benefits from advanced research and analysis of our most promising technologies and helps the United States succeed in the global marketplace. Despite significant changes in technology over the last few years, I believe it is vital for Congress to continue the comprehensive research and assessment program that began in the late 1980s to provide care for all of our scientific leaders and our nation's citizens in these difficult times. Our colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee have given me permission to vote for the fiscal year 1998 appropriation for the Office of Technology Assessment.

Mr. President, more than 200 years ago, Richard Whately, an English logician, said: Not only does our current Cuba policy make it difficult to pursue peace and justice there and to end the struggle to assure the free development and economic future of its people but in a sense we are doing the President and his family a disservice by building on this flag ranchers should be in and such businesses should be out of Cuba and we should be reducing the trade sanctions against Cuba and actually having an economic supply and demand for goods being shared with people in Cuba.

Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2259, a bill that disapproves of the sentencing guideline amendments. Let me state from the beginning that I was fully supportive of the provision allowing mandatory minimum drug penalties for crack cocaine as it related to the release of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the House of Representatives to a White House executive and executive chairman of the White House Council on Crime and the White House in the White House. That was part of the reason for the black vote in the minority during the 1980's and 1990's. But as I review this bill today, I realize that I have to vote for it because it will not achieve the effect that it would have, I might add, if it was perfect in every respect.  I regret that this bill and the White House directive in it threaten the court's credibility, undermine the public's confidence in the institution of the judiciary, and, ultimately

Madam Speaker, yesterday the Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee of Financial Services held a major hearing in the City of Cleveland, Ohio. The subject was community development loans for homeowners and other low- and moderate-income borrowers of public housing. The loan program is one of the most successful programs in the United States and is available to borrowers with mortgage or credit card debt who meet three important criteria to receive these programs. Those criteria are to pay off their mortgage in full within 6 years and to have a job offer within 60 days of receiving services. In exchange for a loan, applicants must do everything to become financially stable.  The recipient must be a single parent with at least one dependent child and demonstrate a demonstrated income for which the program is designed. The applications for the loan program are difficult and time-consuming, and applicants are strongly discouraged from filling out as many forms as possible.

Mr. President, I delighted that the Senate is about to pass the Federal Judiciary Protection Act of 1997, S. 1189. I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation which will increase enforcement of Federal securities laws.  The Federal protection of American securities is of vital importance to the Federal Government and to its citizens generally. The Federal securities laws which provide for maximum efficiency of investment and investor protection help to maintain America's position as a world leader in the production of financial products. Federal securities laws provide a more perfecting protection of investors against theft and loss than the private sector. This is not simply because the Government is entrusted with the potential of extraordinary profits from its securities holdings. The courts have identified private securitization transactions as an important indicator of the success of a company. This treatment is especially important in evaluating the adequacy of a corporate capital formation. Since it is the private entity which establishes the valuation of a contract, a determination of value must

I thought then, and continue to think now, that a political appointment should not be subject to the usual procedures of our great Constitution and laws. To many of my friends on the other side of the aisle the situation is not only concerning but, of course, a matter of great concern to all of the surrounding Members of this House.  Mr. Speaker, it was a monumental step backward from the way things were done under the leadership of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and the precedent set in this case has enormous implications for the future. We have at hand a case which demands the action of this Congress as the American people demand, that we take responsibility for our actions, that we take the time to properly consider it.  Mr. Speaker, we as Americans need to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again.

Mr. Chairman, should America further weaken its national defense strategy by deploying our military to guard rain forests and endangered species in foreign countries as proposed by the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense authorization bill, this country would be irresponsible and would be violating our international agreements and our foreign obligations.  Forest fires and species extinction have become one of the most important environmental concerns facing endangered and threatened species in the western United States, and such measures will be more costly than they are effective. And not only are they costly, but they make the self-perpetuating problems of uncontrollable inflation and ecological deterioration worse.  I have heard time and again from my constituents, people who have worked hard and struggled and sacrificed and raised their families to ensure a safe and secure environment for themselves and their children. We should not be passing a blank check to foreign militaries without adequate management of existing and threatened areas, in addition to limiting the tax dollars that they

Mark graduated from Grand Island High School in 1994 and attended Nebraska State College, where he earned a degree in history and philosophy.  In 2002, Mark joined the Army and began his first deployment in Iraq. Before his departure, he was deployed twice to Afghanistan and twice to Iraq. A dedicated marine, Mark displayed the kind of leadership we can see from our men and women in uniform every day in the field, and his life's service should serve as an example to all Americans.

Over the past month our efforts to investigate this issue have been characteristically unyielding and vigorous. But there is evidence that shows that the House of Representatives, by their actions and inaction, may have violated a number of laws. These include several which apply to the Congress as a whole.  As I mentioned earlier, today I am introducing a resolution which recognizes that in considering the committee mark for the Government operations bill, the House is ignoring certain policies of the past, among them the transfer of jobs from the States to the Federal Government.

Madam Chairman, let me simply point out that the administration has sent us a statement of administration policy, or SAP as it is known in the Congress, which opposes these amendments on the grounds that it would cut American jobs and hurt our economy in this particular effort to reform the tax system in this country that is working so well for us all in the last year and a half or so of the last administration. I would also point out that SAP is not a statement of the administration's position on free trade or even on trade policy as such.  This is not an amendment to fight the WTO in their dispute resolution and we simply want them to look at the rules of the road which they use, which, again, have been of the same quality and the same fair play to the Members of this body that this SAP does.

We are going to have a lot more to say on that issue and other issues in the context of the work we do together to protect our senior citizens and safeguard Social Security, but I would like to make a couple of brief points.  First of all, I think it would be helpful to know exactly how diligently the Social Security Administration has been investigating Mrs. Coats' allegations.

Both cities have been developing their own independent and more innovative approach to developing a mixed-use environment with an emphasis on central areas.

Mr. Speaker, it's deja vu all over again. Another windfall for the wealthy while everybody else gets to work for a living. By my count, this Congress has the most new taxes and tax cuts in history, $2 trillion worth of tax cuts since 2001 to the wealthy while the poor people have had their taxes go up.  The jobs reports are out, so does the destruction of our environment. So is the loss of American jobs. By my count, the national debt in this year's budget is more than $5.4 trillion. That's enough to get by for 4 years and never forgive.  The balanced budget amendment is dead, and that's why it's time for a new approach to education and economic opportunity.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Our good friend from Alaska said we have needs on a per capita basis. But is my colleague aware that on a per capita basis in Montana the people get paid to not raise their taxes because they know that Montana people are not going to be able to pay them for things to do that Montana needs to help people across America, Montana needs to help Montana families to pay their taxes? Is my colleague aware that Montana seniors are going to have a ration in Montana because Wyoming can tax them with respect to tuition assistance and medical care assistance and they have been doing that for about 40 years without any income taxes charged? And so these people distributing income tax bills are in fact perpetuating an injustice that we are doing in Montana to Montana families.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

This bill is critical to preserving the public's ability to have access to information about government and the legislative process.  FOIA ensures that the public has access to the Government and Congress' best available information when requested to do so. To accomplish this goal, FOIA is particularly important to transparency in the Federal Government. And FOIA is the cornerstone of open government and should be a central part of government in any deliberative democracy.  This legislation advances transparency and deserves the support of all of us.

I think you are absolutely right.

That is why the previous number you put up was far fewer than the number that we need.

Mr. President, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act before us, sponsored by myself and Senator Levin, is an amendment to title 5 of the United States Code that will improve the administration of Federal law and procedures for Federal employees and other Federal employees, both public and private sector employees. It was offered as an amendment to bill H.R. 1520 as part of this Congress and passed the House of Representatives in the act of May 17, 1995.  The language of this bill strikes a delicate balance between the Federal Government's prerogatives to grant exemptions to regulations issued pursuant to a statute of limitations and its duties of responsibility under the Administrative Procedures Act of 1950, the fundamental law of the land for the enforcement of the Administrative Procedures Act.  At its core, the bill holds that the Department of Labor must maintain an appropriate accommodation with the requirements of Federal Government regulations when they come to the agency level. By granting its employees and other Federal employees authority

Mr. President, this conference agreement includes the final conference agreement on the District of Columbia appropriations for fiscal year 1996. Like each of the other conference reports on this bill, the bill has been through the Senate and the House and is awaiting the President's signature before it can become law in this city. As I said, the final legislation is the product of a long process that included several legislative hearings and extensive debate in both the Senate and the House reform of the District of Columbia.  The bill includes a substantial portion of what the District of Columbia appropriation already is. The legislation appropriates a total of $5.9 billion for the District of Columbia, which is $26 million less than the authorized appropriation for 1995. The amount appropriated for fiscal year 1996 is also $26 million less than the enacted level for 1996. I want to emphasize this point.  As I have said in the past, this bill provides important resources for the District

Madam President, the issue of climate change is a pressing issue and so I wish to commend the work of my colleagues, and to reiterate the importance of bipartisan engagement to resolve this major challenge. As President Obama stated on the most recent National Climate Assessment, ``The administration believes we should have an increased focus on cutting carbon pollution that is one of our most critical public health threats if we are to meet our CO2 reduction goals in the long term and to help our colleagues to do that.''  As we all know, the 1,000-plus words in the bipartisan agreement that is before us is not just an advisory to the Senate, and it should be a challenge for the administration and Members of Congress to read. It outlines a framework for coordinated United States action to address the world's most profound issue.  The agreement explicitly calls for the Congress to hold significant hearings, hold public forums, collect data on, analyze, and make recommendations

This bill requires a doctor to consult a patient about a specific genetic test before doing anything other than ``life-sustaining medical treatment,'' any treatment that involves administering or administering an injection or an enzyme product to enhance fertility or enhance the health of the woman. It simply provides a public health remedy, which is not one that has been codified into law by another statute.  If enacted into law, this legislation will create a clear standard

Mr. President, under Title 8 of the U.S. Code, a number of criminal offenses are deemed deportable offenses. However, although aliens are deportable for criminal offenses when they commit a Federal criminal act, aliens cannot be deportable for civil law violations or as deportable for possessing controlled substances while committing a Federal criminal act.  Under the Administrative Procedures Act, a process is in place for a request for a certification that an alien cannot be released back into the community because the alien engaged in criminal activity. The certification must be filed within 120 days of the alien's arrest. If the alien is confirmed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, then they can be released back into the community and their criminal history sealed. If the alien is confirmed by the Director of National Intelligence, then they can be released back into the community and their criminal history sealed.

Mr. Speaker, remember when Bill Clinton was asked if he had ever used drugs, he repeatedly told us that he had never violated the laws prohibiting use of alcohol or drugs. Do you remember what that told you?  His answer was, ``I think I have violated laws prohibiting underage drinking, because I had been married to the Attorney General and she was not subject to those laws.''  Later in the investigation, it detergent manufacturers testified about the presence of underage drinkers in their product samples. This brought a resounding cry for enforcement that is still ignored today.  That's not how health care providers ought to answer health insurance questions.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes about our Nation's economic relationship with Africa and one area of concern I have noted with increasing urgency is the President's conference on human rights. As many Members have already noted in their remarks to the conference, our nations share a common goal, to improve the human rights conditions in Africa.  I recognize the importance of good governance and recognizing the rights of individual human beings. We also have a common interest in providing adequate support for our diplomatic initiatives on the continent.  We all agree that the commitment and cooperation of other countries should go hand in hand with our own engagement. Because we are primarily purveyors of aid in Africa, it behooves us to cultivate rapprochement with GAZARIAURGAIAGA GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI GAZI isakson

That was the inference I drew. Let me make one thing perfectly clear. If it is your purpose to cut $270 billion over 5 years, then in a balanced budget you would not cut taxes and you would not raise spending. What is the basis for your proposal to cut that $270 billion and raise taxes and then say we do it on the house and we reduce it, and then we all have to live by it?

Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere belief that at the end of the day we will all be reading from the same page. In order to read from that page in the way that is envisioned in this legislation is to open the House to the view that government was created to serve one segment of the American public. The moment we recognized that it was created to serve one segment of the American public, there will be so much more room for compromise in the U.S. House.  While the process has evolved as to the legitimate right of certain voters to determine their own government, the truth of the matter is that government has never been intended to be good for those who are not citizens, not good for the dead, not good for individuals who are living in a different country, not good for people who are here and are not citizens of another country, not good for children. Government has always been for people.  Mr. Speaker

Madam President, I rise to oppose the amendment. This amendment would replace a key feature of the underlying bill. Right now, under section 104(d) of the Federal Aid to New York City program, when a commercial enterprise builds a new Federal building or a new Federal facility to replace an existing Federal building or Federal facility that has failed, the project receives a funding source and a Federal administrative review that determines whether the project is feasible and whether the Federal administrative record is available to the public. If the project is worthy of receiving Federal funds, the State gives these funds to the project. Otherwise, the project's administrative cost is assumed.  In the case of the location of the Kennedy Center in downtown Washington, DC, the location of the Kennedy Center is in the Hudson Valley. Since the building was closed during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the site has experienced a property degradation due to subsidence. The project is critical to maintaining the city's environmental and safety requirements

That's right. One of the things that really breaks my heart, though, about all of this, we can talk about it from a lofty level in terms of what you could get if we did some of the things that we now are doing here in the Congress that I believe we need to do in terms of reforming the tax code when you get to the very time in the year when a record number of Americans will be filing their tax returns for the very first time because of the so-called tax rate increase this year that was requested by Treasury.  If you take the 3.4 million Americans who will be filing their taxes this year, this is a program that will cost a total of about $5 billion and it will cut taxes for a total of about 2.5 million taxpayers. So that's how many people could actually benefit from this tax package. It's a tax package that will help more Americans file their tax returns than what

We just came through what we call the step-down of interest rates. Let's review where we are now. This is March of this year.

Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, we have three basic principles at issue before us. About 10 years ago Congress made a decision that some Government programs were not essential to the ability of the Federal Government to provide service for which there was no cost to the system. We said that public education is not included in this list. In fact the funds for education programs would flow in only through the acquisition of new equipment to be used for maintenance of existing equipment. As a consequence, we said that the ability of the Federal Government to provide high quality education for all children of this country in their schools, including teaching, reading and math, was seriously threatened if the procedures were adopted by Congress and the President so as to take the Government out of the private education business.  To counter this threat, a committee of eight independent experts representing the American teachers' unions, the national and local school officials, school administrators,

We have always been supportive of women's reproductive health and its rights. However, in order to balance the Federal budget and ensure that the health and welfare of the American people, the Pelosi health care reform plan will go back on its original intentions.

I have visited the Edwards plant before and see it from their point of view and to see the disabled workers and the lives and health of the disabled people and it shows you the values of the plant as a result of their collective bargaining.  Mr. Speaker, we have no objection to this legislation. It will enable some of the 850,000 Federal workers in Ohio and Georgia to make some better wage and benefit decisions. In fact, it will also resolve many of the administrative problems and limitations which have prevented thousands of workers from working at Edwards Plant in Eden, GA, in exchange for employer contributions to the plant's health plan.

We did not talk about it at all in the committee discussion on the first day we came in to the Congress last year when the committee set its amendments aside and spoke in some detail about what this committee is doing, so maybe the chairman could work with the committee to make sure that the committee is not mischaracterized by some in our party today for the rest of this year.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. President, the practical effect of this amendment would be to essentially vitiate the reconciliation process. It would mean we would end up with an essentially tax bill that does not do what we want. It would be a tax bill that does not balance budget.

Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Hutchison-Inhofe resolution in opposition to the Clinton administration's decision to send troops to Bosnia as part of Operation Provide Comfort.  The President of the United States and Secretary of State have repeatedly urged the peace process to be advanced. Yet the Clinton administration has brought troops to Bosnia with exactly the opposite outcome.  This is not a time for compromise. In a cold-blooded decision, the Clinton administration is encouraging Serbian aggression by sending nearly 15,000 troops to Bosnia. Only some two thousand Serbs can tolerate this new policy and any national bloodletting that could occur.  I believe it is only right that we now join the chorus of opponents of this intervention calling on President Clinton to reconsider his decision to send our men and women in Bosnia to blood-bath Bosnia. They want a more robust effort to reach peace in Bosnia. This is not the time to sink our ship and leave our wounded and

Mr. President, one of the finest journalists in our Nation today is David Shribman. He writes a column that appears, among other places, in the Washington Post every Thursday, and it makes a very important contribution to the discussion of this institution and this Congress on health care and the life-and-death question of American democracy.  For the column is entitled ``The Double Fumble.'' David Shribman says a long time ago this country was a health care system under which the question of health care was decided by doctors and patients side-by-side, rather than by a large angle or way that the insurance company or the private insurance company might have placed a particular advantage in front of each other. That is what the American health care system was based on. Now the system is profoundly shifting to one where the patient might not need to have his insurance company negotiate with the physician about what might be the best option for them, and the insurance

This bill is based on legislation that Chairman Jones introduced in the last Congress when he chaired that committee and also the bill that he and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) offered in the last Congress which ultimately became law with strong bipartisan support. As many know, we have added some benefits to this legislation that will make it far more useful for our country and will also provide the rights of American citizens to protect their privacy rights and abuses of our foreign surveillance programs by our Government.  Although the bill we consider today is not as sweeping as some of the similar provisions in the Patriot Act or the USA PATRIOT Act, I believe this bill adds an important addition to all of our efforts to reform our foreign surveillance programs. The bill is the result of a robust and extensive oversight process that uncovered abuses

The substance is creating a serious and growing problem that is not being addressed by the Federal Government and Congress. It is becoming more and more important that we act with an increased vigilance to fight against the misuse of performance-enhancing drugs.  A growing number of studies and news reports indicate that the most active, high-risk athletes in collegiate athletics have used performance-enhancing drugs for years and that these drugs may be harmful in moderate doses and even when they are used under the proper circumstances.

Mr. President, there is a justifiable feeling of anger and worry across America today regarding the ongoing housing crisis. Millions of Americans are currently bearing the burden of their problems without knowing what to do with them or what they need to do with them once they find out what they need to do with them. Home ownership is not simply about getting a good job in a good job. It is about keeping that good job even if you do not have the money to pay it. Many Americans worry that if they lose their job soon they may have to sell their home, and that that economic crisis will cause more people to lose their home. But that problem can only be dealt with if we give every American and every Federal and local Government agency and every taxpayer an adequate way to cope with the housing crisis. We should be asking our localities and our States to put enough money in the hands of them to deal with the housing crisis as best they can

What a great first step. Unfortunately, some of the areas that we have gotten rid of over the last years and took care of some of those areas that have

Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the Doolittle Raiders. Seventy-one years ago this Thursday, 16 Army bombers took off from the flight deck of an Air Force aircraft in the west desert of the United States to attack the Japanese home islands of Tokyo and Iwo Jima, taking on the biggest and most effective American military of World War II with devastating results. The Japanese had no answer for this attack and were on the eve of surrender when the four airmen in the last Saturday morning of the attack dropped bombs on the last Sunday morning in April of that year before the last Sunday morning Thursday, landing safely on the beaches of Okinawa after their planes were shot down and spent the night there.  By chance, one of these U.S. aircraft, a C-141, appeared on the radar screen of the Japanese and, upon a glance, American military authorities made the decision to escort that aircraft to Bataan and crash it at the newly

Mr. Chairman, the bill before us today provides the necessary, and I emphasize necessary, funding for the operations of our Nation's intelligence functions. It also provides the funding necessary to maintain our defenses against nuclear and non-nuclear weapons threats from the President of the United States and the terrorists of the world. Moreover, I emphasize that this Congress has accepted the President's call for the National Intelligence Council to be chaired by the Vice Chairman of the Committee on National Security. This critical step provides the law enforcement and law enforcement coordination and protection for which we have come to be known and deserves recognition here today in this time of degree conflict in the intelligence community.  The ranking minority member of the full committee noted that he had worked with the ranking minority member on the intelligence authorization bill, H.R. 961, and on this amendment the members of the committee have worked closely together.

Mr. Speaker, the Middle East Research Institute, which monitors extremist media, recently reported on a disturbing children's production that aired on Hamas TV. The program, titled ``Boy in a Boy Shoe,'' made it very clear that the International Criminal Court will be able to question and sue those who state that violence is in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The disturbing video also makes it clear that they have been recently informed that Mr. Hamas was informed that only Holocaust deniers have joined his organization. These claims, a long time part of the conspiracy theory behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are confirmed by Mr. Hamas' own propagandists.  This young actor, the only person who performed ``Boy in a Boy Shoe'' in a commercial, has once again exhibited the exaggerated picture of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is time that other media and Palestinians in all positions of power realize the importance of critically examining this disinformation.<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, one would think that, after receiving pallets stacked high with international currency shrouded in secrecy and the associated benefits of this administration's flawed policy, the Administration would show leadership on Iran's nuclear program and have a profound discussion with the Iranian people about the possibility of a deal that would reach agreement. Unfortunately, the Congress of the United States is largely silent on this matter.  I've taken a moment to reflect upon the troubling conditions surrounding the shrouded deals that we call Iran sanctions relief. The terror and economic isolation wrought by Iran's economic and political policies are leading to a race to the bottom, with nearly 50 countries being actively engaged in destabilizing and threatening Iran. In my eyes, that's unacceptable.  In contrast, the cooperation between Iran and the United States has been growing.

Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that all future national monument designations should be subject to consultation with local governments and State officials and should not be subject to national legislation. This amendment also ensures that no change in acreage or site boundaries be made after a year of consultation with local and State officials.  Since the creation of National Forest System legislation last year, the public has expressed concerns about not being consulted on what changes might be made to an existing unit of Federal land. It is essential that the public and the local government have input into what changes might be made to their land.  A third important component to the public's concern over a national monument is the loss of the public's opportunity to participate in planning and development of National Forest System units. A National Park Service road or trail represents the management of a Federal land that is in the public's right-of-way. Without at least three-four

He was an unassuming American hero, a man who spent much of his life working to help others and who also served many in our Armed Forces as the chief legal counsel to the Department of Defense.  David was a member of the U.S. Air Force and worked at the Joint Special Operations Command for the last 18 years after law school in 1985. He was the chief legal counsel for the Department of Defense and chaired committee matters related to the Department of Defense authorization bill. He passed away on January 23, 2015. This legislation, as amended, was enacted into law and continues to this day to protect the security and the well-being of our Nation.  I will never forget David Culp's thoughtful and kind remarks to us as Senator from Connecticut during one of our committee hearings on the bill. I was struck by the way he told us about not only

Madam President, I rise today to provide a brief explanation of my absence during the vote on the motion to proceed to the Reid-McConnell Tax Cut and Jobs Act.  I was at the White House with the President on Sunday and heard the message from the people of the people's Republic of the United States that they are not interested in the status quo and they are not interested in the way things have been going for them in their families. It is important that we take a moment to understand why that is the case and why we should do something about it.  Our economy is in serious trouble. Our deficit has reached unprecedented levels. Households are not meeting their financial obligations. We continue to grow our debt and our debt-to-income ratio, the ratio of net debt to gross domestic product, to about 250 percent of GDP. We have the third largest unfunded liability of any major country in the world. And, Mad

What they served over there in Iraq was money for America to stay in the private sector, to stay productive and to keep American businesses going and our jobs here in America going. President Bush's plan to send hundreds of thousands of our young Americans to Iraq, which is priorities for the American people, despite a lot of opposition from the Nation's rank and file, has run aground here in Washington. For the past 6 years, the so-called President's plan has caused a significant amount of anxiety for the American people and a significant amount of anger for the Congress.

In those days, the insurance companies--Senator Whitehouse has talked often about this, as has Senator Harkin who is standing here now too--that the insurance companies' profits on new businesses went up through more competition. I talked a lot about it back in the State of California when insurance companies were taking jobs away from people and placing them in the business of providing insurance. That clearly was working. So this is a contradiction in terms of competition, and in this bill it is coming down from this other side.

We are spending less and less every year, and deficits continue to rise because of a tax cut, a tax cut for the wealthy.  We passed a tax cut plan in 1993 that sent the economy back into a period of sustained growth. We needed a long-term plan to stimulate the economy that we knew could not be written in this year. We couldn't do it then and we won't do it now. This proposal sets out to do it, the 15-year, fully paid-for plan that is now under debate.

Like many Americans, I have been personally offended by the crudeness and vulgarity of television programming over the years. However, it has become crystal clear to me that broadcast indecency laws are needed today for the broadcasting and radio industries to address this irresponsible behavior. Speaker Gingrich and Congresswoman Sheehan have been working on this legislation for nearly 2 years and these are concrete steps that we can take today to ensure the indecent indecent content obscenely portrays human dignity and the human race.  Nowhere is this more clear than with regard to the public health and safety. There is absolutely no excuse for the indecent and sexual conduct.

The important role Federal helium will play in the power, efficiency and energy of our homes and communities is a vital part of the Government that Interior, Interior's bill, will focus on. This program was a mistake and a poorly designed program that limited the economic future of this Nation. The Government needs to pay back a little of its own money.

Mr. Chairman, it is time to stop this Federal subsidy of a crop that is both addictive and causes cancer. The passage of this amendment will help the farmers of my State who are trying to stay in business by getting the best price in the world for their product and the best time in the world to get their product into the market at a price that they can afford. The threat of cancer from tobacco is growing and will likely be the most dangerous health threat that our Nation will face in the next 50 years because of the union between the environmentalist community and agribusiness.

Mr. Chairman, this amendment is identical to other amendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every appropriations bill considered under an open rule that the House has considered this year. It is identical to the amendment that the Rules Committee voted for last year, voted for and passed on May 14.  But with all due respect to both Chairman McCollum and Chairman Lucas, this amendment makes the bill unworkable and certainly does not make it any more defensible than a Grayson amendment that was accepted by voice vote. It is a smokescreen to protect the status quo from scrutiny in committee, and there is not one shred of evidence on which I can deduce that this amendment will be of any benefit.  We all know, of course, that the chairman of the Rules Committee routinely inserts Republican amendments to appropriations bills into bills considered under an open rule. Chairman McCollum seems to have practiced such a practice repeatedly on appropriations bills under

We are not worried about what it is going to cost Americans because we think we should be able to take care of our bills instead of trying to take it away from them in a way that they do not want to be taken care of because they feel the money should not be taken away from them but simply given to the Government to take care of itself because that ultimately gets us to our better decision.

Mr. President, Senators' bipartisan discussions continued all day yesterday and through the night. Both sides' negotiators, with the administration, are continuing to work toward a final compromise that will address the concerns the families of those who lost their lives in the last week of June after the accident in which a natural gas pipeline ruptured on the day of the tragic accident on May 20 at the Wellstone Permit Number 745 well in Weatherford, MT. It is my understanding that this is the product of those many more business meetings, briefings, phone calls, and intense discussions that have taken place over the past 48 hours.  The two sides are in full agreement on the importance of completing action on this legislation as soon as possible. The ability of Congress to review final conference reports before passing them--a practice that has repeatedly been stymied by the lack of a three-fifths majority--will greatly facilitate a more expeditious completion of this legislation.

There could be 115 billion barrels of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf. That is more than Venezuela's proven reserves of 80 billion barrels. We could sell about $5 billion a day off this oil off the shelf, reduce our gas prices by several thousand dollars a day in Venezuela and in those 2 years, that is well worth it.  This is a solution. This is going to solve a problem for oil and gas production in this country, and it is self-financing. It increases the amount of oil refinement. It will also allow exploration of the undiscovered reserves of oil and gas.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the 30th anniversary on Sunday of the Americans with Disabilities Act being signed into law by George H.W. Bush in the middle of President Clinton's term. It is important to have such legislation passed so that the laws we are putting into effect today can last and make great difference for individuals with disabilities in equal conditions and with equal rights to enjoy the benefits of the law. Indeed, this act has always had a legacy of rights for all Americans with disabilities.  President Clinton signed into law section 1204 of the ADA on April 8, 1990, which prohibits discrimination in all areas of the public accommodations marketplace by employers, landlords, insurers and other health care providers. Section 1204 is the cornerstone of what we have since known as the ADA.  President Bush signed into law section 1201, another key piece of the ADA, on October 4, 1990. Section 1201 prohibits discrimination in education programs and other

Mr. Speaker, time and time again, Americans have said that they want Congress to deal with the real issues, the issues that affect their daily lives, not those that are being raised and played by the Federal Government. That is why I rise today in support of this short-term extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program and the School Breakfast Program.  I have met with school children in my district in Illinois, students who work hard and play by the rules and now find themselves in a classroom full of people who do not have health insurance. This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. The Children's Health Insurance Program will enable thousands of children to gain coverage through the direct participation of employers and the State. There are still 5 million children with no health insurance, and millions more who may fall into the category of children without coverage due to not being able to afford to get the insurance or owing more to their families for health care services.

At the time of the Armenian Genocide, they also included the Christian Armenians. There were numerous massacres perpetrated against them by Turkish authorities, with the aim of uprooting the Armenian Christian population, thus eliminating the Armenian identity as a distinct and indigenous culture from their lands. The victims were often tortured, raped, and killed. Some Armenians who survived survived by migrating to Europe and some, unfortunately, escaped the deportation from their homeland and joined the number of internally displaced persons in Nazi Germany.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

Last Congress, Congress passed three well-intentioned programs, and now the deadline for more legislation is in the balance. The first law mandated that the Environmental Protection Agency establish criteria to allow the private sector

Mr. Chairman, a further parliamentary inquiry: Mr. Chairman, as we established in the previous colloquy, I think that there is also an action available to Members of the House to vote on this action to stop the action on the Committee on Rules on the one hand and on the bill itself on the other hand and to vote on this amendment with an amendment on this vote to the Committee on Rules as chairman of the Committee on Rules as to the disposition of this parliamentary question on the rule.  The CHAIRMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my sincere condolences to the family of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and to recognize his achievements during his lifetime. Judge Rehnquist was one of the Nation's most distinguished lawyers and was considered the father of legal scholarship in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Supreme Court Justice Rehnquist was one of the Nation's leading constitutional scholars and was to become the seventh Chief Justice. A born activist and an organizer who was known throughout his career for his commitment to labor, Dr. Rehnquist helped found the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and was the first President to be appointed to a nationwide board. He was a dedicated supporter of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), during which he served as the president of the National Labor Relations Board for 7 years. In addition to chairing the board for 7 years, he was often a tireless advocate for workers'

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), for his leadership and the leadership he has provided to many, many other people and businesses that had come before this House to attempt to help address the health care crisis that is going on in this country today and that we have seen on television in the last few months that have brought us to the current state that we are in today with the government shutdown.  I rise in support of this rule because we have a critical public health and well-being issue that is being brought before us in this country that has international implications.  One of the main problems that we have with these, frankly, health insurance programs is the fact that they encourage the purchase of health insurance. It encourages the purchase of health insurance through direct mail, it encourages the purchase of health insurance through advertising, through coupons, through message of

Mr. Chairman and Members, today I rise again in strong opposition to this bill. I support the efforts to increase competition in the video marketplace. However, I rise today to urge that this is not the time to take consumer choice away from the consumers and Internet service providers who are the fundamental force behind the growth of the Internet as a forum for innovation and competition.  Many Americans are also concerned about how the current open-Internet policy affects their ability to access the Internet and the difference that it will make to the Hispanic community Latino-owned businesses and internet entrepreneurs in the San Francisco Bay area are already seeking the ability to reach out and compete with non-Latino businesses in many markets. The Republican majority's efforts to take away these commonsense provisions may further hurt small businesses and internet entrepreneurs and actually will decrease overall access and innovation in the web. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Pallone amendment and to remember that a part of the greatest

The Senator from Hawaii is correct. I would also state that our amendment is intended to prohibit the Secretary or any other Federal official from issuing or renewing an official travel document under any other provision of law that creates the impression that a Government official may be using such official travel document to engage in political activity and to receive direct campaign contributions. Senator Baucus's statement of policy was correct in that the provision is intended to protect officials from Government official travel in the course of official official business and for other official purposes. The Interior Secretary has a great deal of discretion in how official travel and personal conduct should be handled by the Government, and the accommodation and accommodation guidelines, which were created by an Executive order signed by the President in 2008, are very helpful.  Mr. COSTA. I rise in support of the nomination of Margaret Morrow to serve as Deputy Secretary of the Interior.  I want to recognize my colleague, the Senator
