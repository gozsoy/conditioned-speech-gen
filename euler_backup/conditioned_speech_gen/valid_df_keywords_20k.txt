Mr. Chairman. I rise today in opposition of the rule for the VA/HUD Appropriations bill that shortchanges health care for our nation's veterans. The bill is $2.1 billion below the GOP House Budget Resolution and $3.3 billion below the veterans' consensus budget.  The Rules Committee created a rule for the VA/HUD bill that does not allow two amendments. The first seeks to add $1.8 billion for veterans' health care|| committee, budget, gop

Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 4137. We recently have heard several tragic instances of women being sexually assaulted after their drinks were laced with potent sedative drugs. The bill imposes stiff penalties for the unlawful distribution and trafficking of Rohypnol and extends criminal penalties to anyone convicted of using a controlled substance with the intent to commit a sexual battery.
