Mitch McConnell has been the only Republican in Congress to lead the GOP’s fight against Trump for more than a year. The House passed a resolution calling for the Senate to “impose new sanctions on any State or individual member of the government for any financial or personal injury or wrongful act,” according to a recent ABC News/Washington Post/CNN story, which aired on Sunday morning. “The bipartisan resolution calls on senators to impose new sanctions on the president if he commits misconduct or a financial loss. But if the sanctions aren’t imposed, that could put the Senate’s power to punish or punish the president in the event of a criminal contempt of Congress.” McConnell is an independent committee member, where he represents all of the Senate except for the Senate in Washington. He has endorsed Trump’s immigration bill.

According to a new NBC News/Fox News/Roll Call article, McConnell also signed a bill in August that would lift the law to allow Trump to stay out of immigration. In the news story, he is described as a former aide to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who was previously a co-chair of the bill. McConnell’s Senate presence has also been under the spotlight in recent weeks

Harry Reid has a lot to answer for when it comes to Donald Trump.

When asked about his decision to stand down on Thursday night from campaigning for Donald Trump, Reid said: "I don’t do this thing right now, if anybody thinks that they should do that.”

That said, Reid didn’t give the president the details on why he wanted Trump elected.

Reid also dismissed the idea of a new normal vote for Trump.

“It’s going to be like this, it’s going to be a referendum, and then you’ll be able to vote as they’re asking,” he said.

“And, in terms of the way I was elected, that’s going to be a different thing to me.”

Reid, a senator from the Nevada seat, told the Star he thinks the vote could be done through normal ballots.

That’s why Reid wanted to make it so he could hold his own senate in 2020.

"The way I’m voting today is I don’t like being stuck on the wall," Reid said. "And I don’t
Harry Reid: There are so many good people who would like to be inducted into the Hall of Fame but there are not that many.

The former New York Rangers owner, Bob Gibson, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame for the second time in the past decade.

“I am excited about Bob Gibson’s legacy. It will go a long way towards bringing back Bob Gibson into the Hall of Fame,” the retired New York Rangers legend said in a statement on the team’s website.

“It has been a great honor and many people who have worked with Bob in the past have been kind enough to give him their time and love and thank you for it.

“He is a great, kind, hard-working guy and the second in the new year I would like to do that for the team, the fans, and the community of New York City.”

Gibson, the former Rangers owner, is a friend of President Donald Trump, the former New York Rangers general manager, and the head of baseball operations, and served in that capacity from 2008 to 2012.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, we had a meeting today about the Federal government--which I know was chaired by Senator Sanders, but I think it's a close one--and what we learned from it is that the President has done a lot of things that we thought we could use to help save the lives of the people of Texas and this is a wonderful place, and I do believe he did a good job. I want to congratulate the gentleman on his second vote.  There is a lot of opposition to the bill. The bill was voted on by the House at a number of votes.  The problem is, even if that was the case, and even if that wasn't the case, we know the other side has worked a lot better than we can get a bill through a cloture vote.  The bill does not address the issue of unemployment benefits, and we think this bill should be a bipartisan measure, and I am just glad we didn't have to rely too heavily on the votes on this amendment.  The Senator has said he wants a bill that does more than just fix the unemployment rate. He wants a bill that addresses those important issues of public health, public health care, public safety, and education.  
Mitch McConnell. The Senate now has 10 days.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary should adjourn on Thursday, March 24, at 10 a.m., the 14th day after its adjournment.  The President recognizes the opportunity of the
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the legislation to amend our Nation's financial security legislation to include a requirement that banks repay their Federal loans in a timely manner for the purposes of avoiding default.  
Harry Reid. Would you say that is part of the work done by my administration?  The Senator said on Wednesday that the House and Senate were working together on bipartisan legislation that would, essentially, get the President to pass the budget; that if that is all the Senate and House did for the President's budget, then the House would have a budget bill with the Senator-elect working for it, and that is all the Senate was working together to try and get to the finish line.  Now, I understand the Senator is not talking about his own appropriations bill, but what he has said is that he wants to get funding, and I do not know what he is talking about for the President's budget, but let me give you an example from the Senate.  A small business owner has been asked by an constituents for 5 minutes by his boss:  What do we do to deal with the problem?  The employee has asked this question on 5 minutes. The Senator said:  The problem is that there is no such thing as a problem, and the people are talking about it.  There is no problem.  This is not an idea that I'm willing to bring up, and it is not the Senate's way to solve this problem; I believe that
Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, today, I would like to speak to the gentleman from Texas from Pennsylvania, and would like to ask him an ad-hoc question about the pending amendment we passed. The underlying proposal was to include a provision requiring all individuals to have a 5-year sentence from a convicted gang member to be imprisoned under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  The issue in this case is that the underlying law requires that we put that language in a provision that could not be read as giving all individuals at least 5 years to be imprisoned under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, even those who would commit murder or theft offenses. We would also require that those individuals receive the minimum term of 5 years for the person's life.  So this is a language that we need to be a little bit clearer.  The issue here is that the amendment was passed to add the new section, which would read:      A person shall have 5 years in prison for the commission of a crime, including murder or theft, which is either an assault, a rape, or a kidnapping, including the life of the victim.  The amendment provides that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for violent crimes shall be 1 year or less.      
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise in support of H. Res. 825.  This legislation is a historic bipartisan response to an historic tragedy and an economic tragedy.  It will improve American infrastructure, rebuild America's energy security, create jobs, and provide Americans with jobs.  I would like to focus on the positive energy security that this legislation would address.  I appreciate your leadership. I look forward to working with this legislation on a bipartisan basis.  This legislation, we are talking about here in Connecticut, is absolutely a strong, bipartisan effort to address our energy security and to provide America with jobs. This legislation will help reduce the costs of the economic recession and make this economic emergency the largest priority for American businesses.  The legislation is truly an amazing piece of legislation that makes great progress over many years of progress, including my support of this legislation. It's a bipartisan piece of legislation, and I have to say that my time will be precious with respect to the American people.  It's not just my time. It's our time. The American people deserve an amazing piece of legislation.

I hope he finds something else.  Mr. Childers has got a lot of work to do. He's got to come to the House to speak to the House, to the Senators, to the President.  What he said before is true, but what we heard today was right, it was true that he believed that in this House, where his own people had to vote against, we should be able to have a stronger voice and vote for him that is, at least, on the side of the people to try to bring some sort of amendment to the House.  We heard what he said. There were some amendments today. There were a lot of amendments. He talked about bringing a motion to bring a amendment.

Ozsoy was chosen to serve as the Democratic chairman in the 2014 Presidential Race. He served for six years before running for the presidency in 2014.  He was nominated by President Trump to serve as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He won a competitive nomination for the Republican nomination for Senator from Vermont, where he had already served as a member of the Judiciary Committee.  His nomination to the Senate Intelligence Committee did not pass the Senate in a timely fashion, as he would have it not be until later on in the year when a nominee for a U.S. Senate seat was considered more important.  In August 2015 he won his second consecutive Democratic nomination to serve as the first African American to serve as a member of the Senate.

In the U.S. Congress, the  majority of Americans have an accumulated deficit of $2.1 trillion. The  majority of Americans in the Senate are  in the midst of an economic crisis.  In the Senate, the majority of  people are being taxed. In the Senate, the majority of  people are being taxed. We have no other way of doing this.  That is why the majority of Americans have a debt of $14 trillion. That is a deficit. That is an $800 billion deficit.  It is in the American economy. We will spend some money in the United States Government. We will spend $13 trillion, the most significant spending in the history of American history.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy of William Farr, an immigrant from Poland, who served as a senior counselor to the Secretary of Defense for his service as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After graduating from Georgetown University in 1970, William served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy in World War II. His contributions and achievements made it possible for him to serve more than 30 years, during which time he served as a U.S. Marine Corps veteran. He went on to serve as a distinguished and well-liked military judge for his military experiences, retiring as a decorated Air Force veteran in 1988 and becoming President of the American Academy of the Arts in 1990. Throughout his career, he served as an expert judge for the Defense Department. In 2007, he received the Bronze Star Medal with Purple Heart, an award that honors those who service honorably. His son is a recipient of the Robert C. Dole Award for the best academic dissertation at the Federal University of Manchego.

I am a great believer in God, a committed soul, a faithful servant of the Lord, and an eternal servant of the Lord for my life.  I want to say I am thankful for the sacrifice I have made for George Lee McClintock, his family, his home State, and to the many people who supported him through the years. I want to say I am very grateful for the efforts of my husband George, his staff, his many neighbors, and many friends, for his hard work, his hard work, his hard work, and to see the end to the world when the world is at an end.

Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have an opportunity to take up the request of an Assistant Director of the Department of Homeland Security from the President of the United States.  The Department of Homeland Security, an agency that we have in many branches, was one of the longest-serving branches in the Nation. It is a very important office to have in place.  Now, the Department of Homeland Security is one of the oldest branches in the United States and in my office the longest serving for nearly 150 years.  I know that the Department of Homeland Security, for the last 150 years, has been one of the longest serving branches in the United States, including the entire length of the Department. In addition to the Department, the Department has been the longest standing branch in the Nation.  The Secretary of Homeland Security, as I know, was a veteran of the military and is also a very well respected leader in the Department, and he helped guide us from one very important decision to one very important decision at one very important decision every single day.

One of the hallmarks of this bill is the requirement for all U.S. military personnel to have access to an authorization check from the Senate to be issued to every person who has served in combat.  While this provision allows an officer to receive authorization checks by submitting a letter dated September 26, 2012, from the Senate Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the authorization check has been issued.  I am pleased to support this legislation, and I urge all Members to support it.

I know what it means that people who have lost loved ones and others who have been injured, who are lost, are those who have made history and have made good lives. It is a tribute to the veterans who serve with us all and the young people who have passed away at their side. It is also a tribute to those who went off to war and returned.  Last Sunday, it was the first time in over 1 week that we had a family in a Veterans' Memorial. This was an incredible day to honor that group of veterans who gave their lives to serve our veterans and our communities. There were so many who were the first to have their names printed on the front of their homes or they would come to the community to mourn.  The National Guard made a tremendous impact on the lives of veterans and to us, they were greatly involved in our country's war effort. The National Guard members that were killed by the Navy and the Marine Corps and those who served in that Navy and the Marine Corps were also greatly involved in helping to establish this National Guard.

In particular, I am asking my colleagues to support this amendment to prevent the current administration from imposing additional fees and burdensome requirements on companies, from taking the money that they need to recover this waste, and from taking the money to make sure that that will never happen again.  We all know it is a waste, a waste that we can do more damage with.  The issue before us today is simply, is that we have got a national emergency and we are going to be shut down forever.  If I were one of my colleagues, who would be the first to say that I think that's an incredible position. We all understand that.  It's a reality and it is very well-deserved. The Federal Government can't keep doing it for other people. They have a right to do it, but if they get to that, it doesn't work for other people.

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a number of Members yield to the gentleman from Illinois on the issue of the H.R. 1073 amendment. I appreciate his work on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House proceed to consider the H.R. 1073 amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Schock).  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from California.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 478. I reserve the balance of my time.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding me this time. As he knows, Oklahoma has been suffering from a terrible drought this year. It is a problem that needs to be addressed, and I urge my colleagues to vote yea or nay.  The House should now take a page from this report and pass a bill that will ensure that no one will be able to keep flooding through the winter that is threatening our communities and our country, and will require every State to implement this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Ozsoy), offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Boccieri), and opposed by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Boccieri).  The question was taken; and the gentlewoman rose.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to give the bill a little tribute and appreciation. It provides for the Department of Justice's Federal Building and National Capital Region's Public Housing Fund and the National Economic Development Assistance Program, as well as for the Federal, State, and local governments that operate Federal housing facilities. It provides for the Department of Agriculture's Federal Housing Administration and the Department of Transportation's HUD. It provides for the Secretary of Homeland Security's Federal Trade Service, as well as to the Office of the Administrator of DHS. I would like to thank my colleagues for the support of the bill, which would assist the President in the long run, as well as to the committee on this body. And I thank my colleagues for the bipartisan support.  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the bill that would authorize the Attorney General to proceed in the Office of Special Counsel to ensure that we preserve the Federal Government's public safety record and that our national security and national security as a whole is protected.  I am proud of the gentleman from Pennsylvania who is the chief counsel to the Department of Justice. He is our new Attorney General.  President Obama and I met a few years ago to talk a little about security issues
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1029, the National Defense Authorization Act.  The 
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my deep concern about this legislation, the President's budget. The President is in fiscal year 2010 and has already announced the budget, which is very similar to last year. The Senate passed $3.1 billion in the first half of the fiscal year.  With that, I move to the supplemental funding bill, and for the record, I would also like to say this bill provides all the necessary funding to make sure this bill keeps up with the demands of American families. This funding should be provided for under this bill.  Now, the other side of this issue has to do more for seniors in this country.  This is the issue that everyone has a say in, and it is not one that we are talking about, it is one that this body is talking about here today. We should all be able to control the people that get out. This is not just a budget, but a budget that goes through these appropriations bills, through this legislation. And we don't have to keep it up. We can get the budget done and do our job. We are not in a recession, and if we do not keep doing what the President has to do we are going to be in a recession
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid on the table en bloc.  The 
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his great leadership on this issue and for all the support. I want to thank Senator Klobuchar for his work on the immigration problem. I also want to thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on this issue.  I want to thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on the job-killing problems in New York City.  As my Senator has said, the city of New York is one of the most vibrant cities in America. It is one of the few places where Americans of all political stripes can go to get a job. And when you have a city that does not have a job, you can make the most difficult decisions about what to do about what city to call.  I want to thank Senator Enzi for his leadership on this issue, as well as the work he has done in his home State of New York on this issue, and that is why I believe we should have bipartisan support for a new Federal immigration bill.  This legislation is a victory for our economy, not a defeat for our national security, as we know it. It is a win for our kids and a victory for the children in New York, not a defeat for New York City in New York. 
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 13 to consider Calendar No. 14 to consider Calendar No. 15 to consider Calendar No. 16 to consider Calendar No. 17 to consider Calendar No. 18 to consider Calendar No. 19 to consider Calendar No. 20 to consider Calendar No. 21 to consider Calendar No. 22 to consider Calendar No. 23 to consider Calendar No. 24 to consider Calendar No. 25 to consider Calendar No. 26 to consider Calendar No. 27 to consider Calendar No. 28 to consider Calendar No. 29 to consider Calendar No. 30 to consider Calendar No. 31 to consider Calendar No. 32 to consider Calendar No. 33 to consider Calendar No. 34 to consider Calendar No. 35 to consider Calendar No. 36 to consider Calendar No. 37 to consider Calendar No. 38 to consider Calendar No. 39 to consider Calendar No. 40 to consider Calendar No. 41 to consider Calendar No. 42 to consider Calendar No. 43 to consider Calendar No. 44 to consider Calendar No. 45 to consider Calendar No. 46 to consider Calendar No. 47 to consider Calendar No. 48 to consider Calendar No. 49 to consider Calendar No. 50 to consider Calendar No. 51 to consider Calendar No. 52 to consider Calendar No
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3622, a bill that will reduce the cost of a gas pipeline lease to the owners of the new highway in the area of Route 21. It provides for a subsidy to the owners of this new highway so the owners can get a new lease.  I'm delighted to support H.R. 3622 in an effort to keep the gas companies out of the pipeline, because it's a key part of the solution for the State of Montana. 
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, it's time for the Democrats to get serious. If the Republicans are serious about putting on the brakes, they ought to be in the Senate to begin debate in July.  I, along with my colleagues, am here to tell the Democrats that we need to come together as a Congress to pass a balanced budget. We've got to do what the President has to say to us. We've got to do this work and work together, that is the job of the American people. They need to be on a budget in December.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Blumenauer), the distinguished chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who has served on the Financial Services Committee for 10\1/2\ years, and the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer.  
Travis Childers. If you are here today, you might not recognize that one person, and you might not notice that one person is not an individual and you might not notice one person is not a group. That is what it has to do with the fact that, in every single thing the Congress has done, it has done it on a national level, on a global level. You have to pay attention. The whole system of what it has to do, when one person makes an individual and makes an individual, is a global tax that's a national debt that they're going to be subject to, and that has to be paid in.  And that's what we're trying to do today, in the same way that the Federal Government in the United States, in the same way, as this government, as it was in the past, has taken all of the money that it took off those assets to pay this debt. That, you know, they took off everything, because the debt was, you know, we were spending, you know, billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions. So, the Congress is not, I believe, the only one of them with an obligation
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I thank you, Mr. Speaker. I also thank Representative Van Hollen, Mr. Hastings, Mr. Hastings, and Mr. Smith for their remarks.  I yield to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Barton) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.  The Clerk will designate the name of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Barton) in the Record.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Barton) that it be dispensed with?  The material on which the request was made was printed in the Record.  The Clerk read the report.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak about the need for legislation to reduce the deficit and, hopefully, to reduce the deficit by increasing the deficit at a time when it is important to both of these two different ends of the spectrum.  In order for a country to grow, we need to create jobs, create new jobs, invest in research and development, and create a sustainable and stable economy. While the idea of lowering the deficit in one way or the other is one that we need to be working to accomplish, this legislation requires a much more complicated and complex legislation.  I agree that lowering the deficit creates jobs, but the fact is, a larger deficit does not necessarily make the job more lucrative or less rewarding. It simply creates a deficit which has a more direct effect on the economy.  Unfortunately, it is so important that we invest in the research and development that we can stimulate those businesses that have proven productive and are growing.  I support the leadership of the National Association of Manufacturers, as a cosponsor of this bill. This is a very important part of our economy, and we need to continue to create jobs, create innovation, invest in research, and create a sustainable and stable economy. This is just

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a moment about the Senate bill the majority on which the majority sits. It is the Senate bill, the bill that President Bush, as Senator Bush and the President are now negotiating. That is the Senate bill.  I wish to speak a little bit about the Senate bill which the majority has adopted this morning, but it is not a perfect bill. It is an important legislation. The language in the Senate bill does not do a particularly great job of addressing the issues of domestic violence, domestic violence and domestic violence. It does not do a particularly good job of addressing the domestic violence issue. I believe that one would think that the Senate bill, which is more about domestic violence and domestic violence, but more about domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence and domestic violence

We need a strong national security force that will protect our Nation and our homeland from terrorist attacks.  The

It is a huge step forward for the American people who have been working with us for this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Childers) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4587, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the distinguished ranking member, the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kirk), the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, who has been a leading advocate on the issue of immigration, and his colleague, the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, the ranking member of the subcommittee.  The purpose of this question is to clarify how important it is that we get to see the relationship between the Republican leadership on immigration matters and the Republican leadership on border security as we begin to look at the importance of this issue.  What this inquiry will do is to outline what we understand as the nature of the issues here on the border and what we understand as how they affect our policy on immigration.  In this context, it is important to note, if we are going to use this as an indication of the underlying strategy that the administration is pursuing and the nature of the issues with which we are dealing, and as this will serve as a point of emphasis when the underlying issue, if we think it is the most important, is immigration, is something that has a great deal of value and that is our responsibility and obligation to try to protect the most vulnerable, especially those
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the work of the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB).  This is the ninth annual annual Statewide Trade Fair, sponsored by the NFIB and its affiliated small business groups. Last year, the NFIB's annual trade fair program received the highest number of entries from over 100,000 businesses in 13 States, resulting in more than 500,000 participants and over $4 billion of additional work.  Last year, the NFIB's fair was the first U.S.-based fair to be held in the entire United States. Last year, it was the largest trade fairs of any U.S. small business, with over 400,000 participants. It is our hope that by the end of the year the small business community will be able to recognize the strong positive work of the NFIB and their efforts in their efforts to attract and retain American businesses.  The NFIB and its affiliates employ more than 50,000 employees and over 1 million small business owners nationwide.  As a member of the NFIB's trade committee, I'm proud to be a member of their trade committee and of our association's national efforts. Our members are the best-represented in the trade

Harry Reid. Madam President, I am pleased to rise in support of Mr. President of the Senate, Senator Graham.  I am glad to see this distinguished Senator from the State of Vermont join Senator Graham as he is presiding in the Senate for the second time on this issue. The Senator from Vermont is a leader on both sides of the aisle. It is true that Senator Graham has not yet decided to serve on the committee and to join the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have a long and proud tradition in which to help foreign leaders as well as U.S. citizens.  We have had our first meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We had the privilege to meet with him during one of his State visits. He is a brilliant man of political theater. It is a pleasure to be able to meet with him. We will not be surprised to see him as Senator.  I have been involved in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for over 30 years. We have been involved in other areas and we have worked together to improve relations. The work we have done over the last many years has been to strengthen our relations with the United States. We have worked on issues important to our country as well as our foreign policy.  We have been together since our very first

We are in agreement that we are here to continue to negotiate, and I think it is the right thing to do.  As a former U.S. military intelligence officer, I have known the administration's decision to keep the doors open. The Senate has spoken and the President has indicated he wishes to close them, and if that is not the case, we will do it by unanimous consent, and I understand that if the President were to speak on it, he could ask Chairman Heller to vote against it. But I am very opposed to that, and it is my hope that we are not going to allow a vote by the President to do that.  The 
Richard Durbin. Well, thank you, Mr. President.  I have a question for the Senator from Oregon.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 446, the National Small Business Jobs and Entrepreneurship Act of 2017. This measure would prohibit the administration and the Treasury from considering or implementing the amendment they believe will help make small business more accessible, job-creating jobs, and creating jobs for the working class.  This is an important step to make small businesses a more competitive sector for America and for future generations. As the President has said repeatedly, small business success is at the heart of our Nation's economic growth and success in the years ahead. It is why small business must be a part of our economic recovery strategy.  For decades, small business has been overlooked by the American people and industry because of its importance to America's economy, to the American people, to our middle class and to our country. Small businesses have not been without challenges, but they have been overlooked by our economy.  When the President came to office, he was concerned about small businesses, but we now understand it will be a difficult time for them and a tough time for the American people. We want to hear our businesses grow more. I am confident we will find the best businesses for America and our country.  If this
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I have the great privilege of representing my fellow constituents at our local local radio station in south central Pennsylvania. I am particularly honored to have been able to play a pivotal role in the community of southern Pennsylvania as well as in the communities in my district.  For more than 6 years, we have been working together as a radio broadcaster to develop and improve the radio arts and arts education for the general public. I think we have done this by offering new programming, by helping to bring together different schools that are serving each other, to create a common space for our citizens to grow and flourish in the future. We have had the privilege to partner with some of our local leaders as part of the Special Order of the Day program, which is a great tribute to one of our many dedicated listeners and volunteers.  In the midst of all of this great work, I would like to thank Mr. Abercrombie for his many years of hard work and dedicated work, all of which I have enjoyed this evening on the floor and in the gallery.
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 844, a bill that would create jobs and grow wages. This bill would ensure that we address the devastating impacts of the Great Recession.  The bill that I'm offering to the Committee of the Whole House is one of the most comprehensive and important pieces of legislation we have seen in many years, with bipartisan support. This is not a bill that has many provisions, particularly in this bill, that provide important protections for employees and their families.  The bill that the Committee of the Whole House is working to achieve makes good sense to the American people. I don't want to undermine that very much.  We are working on a bill that will make sure that America can continue to get its job done without the burdens that have come our way. There are a lot of people out there that will be left in a situation that they could have been able to overcome or that they could have avoided.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 844. I want to thank Chairman Smith, Chairman Lamborn, and Ranking Member Crenshaw for their hard work and leadership over this past 5 months to reach this point.  Mr. Speaker, I
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R. 662, including comments on the National Labor Relations Board and on the recent changes to the Board, and include extraneous materials on the proceedings.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado?  There was no objection.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I have to point out that this isn't the first time I have heard a question from the chairman of the U.S. Senate about this bill.  As a former member of the Commerce Committee, I remember hearing about a bill the other day that was the first time that I had seen an amendment to the Commerce Committee on this bill. The fact is that this is a bill that can be done more quickly than you could have imagined.  I was going to vote on this amendment. It was a bipartisan bill. I voted for it. This amendment is part of the bill that the President introduced.  So it has been a long, long process. My question is, if I are an expert on how to do this bill, I understand that the U.S. has a lot of experience in crafting the rule in that committee. I understand the intent, and I know I could have voted on this in a bipartisan manner.  So I am glad that I took the opportunity to read the bill. The U.S. Department of Commerce, as you know, was the first one to craft the bill, and they are working to make sure that it is bipartisan. They are looking at what the

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, today, I wish to honor the life and service of John W. Dye. He was an outstanding man. He has been a dedicated and diligent servant, and I am honored to stand with him in his service to the U.S. House of Representatives.  On January 26, 2018, I made the pledge that the House will hold a joint oversight hearing on the nomination of Dye to the Supreme Court for appointment to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  I look forward to hearing this debate, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''  I thank the Senate for having this opportunity to make this historic nomination possible. My hope is that our efforts will succeed.  As we prepare for the confirmation hearing, we should look to each other for the next steps we can take to confirm John W. Dye. It is with great sadness that I announce that my colleagues in the Senate will be holding an additional joint oversight hearing in September on the nomination of George K. Scott to the United States Supreme Court. This hearing, scheduled to begin Wednesday, will focus on Mr. Scott's nomination and the challenges that were brought by his lack of legal experience at law school.  I would like to

Harry Reid. Madam President, I now recognize Senator Durbin for his Special Order for the second consecutive year.  Senator Durbin has been an outstanding, thoughtful public servant--a man of enormous intellect and vast experience. He has been a leader in this issue. He is a true advocate. He is a man of passion and integrity, a champion for the American people. He has made an important difference in a very bipartisan and diverse country.  I want to congratulate Senator Durbin on his second term, but I also want to congratulate Senator Menendez on his fifth. He is a distinguished chairman, chairman of the Joint Committee on Intelligence, and ranking member of our Appropriations Committee. I want to commend him on his second term for his work in his district.  Senator Menendez, a great leader and a real leader, will do well in that capacity. In this body he is the best in our country--an outstanding leader. He will have the great opportunity to lead this Congress. I wish him and his family the best in our country.  I have heard a few speeches from other Senators this Congress, and I know they will agree with me. They are all leaders. They will do everything possible to promote and to expand this country and to

Richard Durbin. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the upcoming fiscal year 2015 NDAA.  This is a very important legislation to help our Nation's military get around the budget hole that exists in our country.  As I have said before, it is going to take a number of years of funding to pass the NDAA. For example, I voted for the Defense authorization. I opposed the $60 billion earmark that is due before this is passed. I voted for the NDAA and have no intention of supporting it in the next couple of years.  As I mentioned, I don't think that we should be spending money on military operations. I am so confident that the Pentagon is going to have the tools we need to go out to the civilian military community.  So I would ask my colleagues, this legislation would not have helped our Nation but it would have been helpful to protect America's troops and to make sure we didn't end up having our hands on the government for long periods of time.  I will add that this is an open and transparent process for the Congress to take action to make sure that the people of this country want to work together.  Madam President, I wish to speak about the NDAA. I am
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to attend today's hearing. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no.''

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me the time. I am a good friend of mine, and I appreciate the fact that the gentleman has been so patient about addressing this problem of unemployment.  Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the fact that people who are stuck in the dark years have been getting their last breath every year, and this is not about the money; it is about making money.  We know that, as part of our efforts to prevent the financial crisis, and the job losses caused by COVID-19, we had the gentleman on our side. This is all about creating the jobs we need to create American jobs.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his kind words.  Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this legislation, as he is very passionate about the job losses.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H. Res. 919, the ``Time for Congress,'' that requires us to move forward in a bipartisan manner to advance the goals and purposes of Congress that I believe would benefit the most Americans.  My home State of Oregon is the fourth largest State in the United States with over 1.6 million residents. I grew up in the city of Portland and serve this community and local businesses throughout the greater Portland metropolitan area, as well as across the State.  Our State has been on the forefront of providing our children and young people with education and opportunities. I represent Oregon in the Energy and Commerce Committee, as well as a small, rural area in south central Washington.  We have a robust and growing economy, a great State and a strong economy. We are on a path to prosperity and a clean energy economy.  There is more than meets the eye. The time for Congress should not be with us at the ballot box and we must focus on our goals.  Congress should have the tools to be focused on job creation, to invest in research, development, and modernization of our Nation's resources to create jobs and prosperity.

When I first got to the Senate, it was a great success. We had a great leader and a great leader, and a good leader at the time. But we didn't get to have a single vote. Senator McConnell was very proud of that.  Senator Schumer and I were proud that Senator Schumer was here, but it wasn't a question that we had. We had a long-term leadership. There were many bipartisan reforms we brought to the bill that was a bill that was very robust, and very much worked, and that was a big one. It was a very big one.  It was about people having a stake in the Congress. The Senate worked well together to create a government, and that was a bipartisan one. We have a lot of support, and the Senate worked well together to bring it together. And I think it was a bipartisan bipartisan piece of legislation that we passed, that is a big bipartisan piece of legislation.  But Senator Schumer, Senator Schumer, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, and I look forward to working with them and working with the Appropriations Committee, hopefully, in a much more
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I have been here 30 years and I still have not been able to recall this moment or think I was alive once when I was a freshman, but I have been here for about 30 years. It's really been a memory for me because I think it is about the fact that I've been here for a long time, and that there were people who voted in the House of Representatives, I'm going to take this memory of them for a reason.  It is the memory of my friend from North Carolina. He said he knew that he was not going to say a single word about it. He said, Well, we have got to vote in a minute, and he said, Well, we've got to get us out of this mess because we are going to have to go back to where we are. There was not a vote in this country at that time in the last 30 years, the most recent, the highest-ever vote in our country. It was the highest vote that anybody in America voted for at that time. He was the most progressive man in this country.  He said there had been a huge revolution, and he said it was going to happen now that it had been over 100 years ago, and he

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to one of our great economic experts, Dr. Michael Shuster. He is a renowned health economist, a pioneer of our Nation's health, and a former ranking member of the Republican Health Policy Caucus. He has written the Congressional Budget Office, and served as the chairman of the health care bill for the last Congress.  Dr. Shuster came from an agribusiness background that has always been evident to us. He is known in Congress as a thoughtful, wise, and good-hearted person who has worked to help our Nation--especially our small business community--to succeed. As the chairman of the Budget Committee, I know that in the years that I have been on the Budget Committee, I have noticed that Dr. Shuster is not the only person who has made his mark on health. He is the dean of the American Medical Association. I know that in some of the other public and private organizations I have talked to about him. He has the record of being a very good health care expert.  We recently introduced a new health care bill that would make $10 billion to $15 billion off of the costs of the health care program. This was something that Mr. Shuster has
Richard Durbin. I note the Senator from Kentucky and I agree that it is our intent to get rid of it.  I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, there is a tremendous sense of urgency on the part of the people on the other side of the aisle. One of the reasons it was done was because it was a partisan one, and they felt that it could be a step backward and could be a step forward. This is why we've decided to pass this important legislation, because we know the need.  This is a vote we are going to make, Mr. Speaker, and I would like to thank the Senator from Kentucky. I think it is also important, for the good reasons, that this issue be an issue of fairness and the way it is handled. We do not understand the circumstances under which it would occur, but it should be a matter of fairness and respect, because we've been trying to fix this, and it's been trying for years to fix that, and we have to do it for years.  It doesn't make sense because they would rather get to that point. It doesn't make sense.  I am not concerned about this particular issue. I am concerned about that, but I think it's the right thing
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Baucus for his support of H.R. 1263, the Taxpayer Jobs and Efficiency Act.  The President has spent too much time, and over the last 30 years, the American taxpayer has spent more than enough time on the taxpayer's behalf to ensure that taxpayer money isn't used to spend on programs that can't be used to spend on programs that can't be used to spend on programs that can't be used to spend on programs that can't be used to be paid to individuals.  This provision, I believe, is important and necessary, and it is critical for America's economy.  Last month, we passed a tax on all incomes, an important tax on small businesses that is critical to the overall economy.  For this reason alone, the House passed H.R. 1263 in 2013 to create jobs, create tax relief, and create growth and job creation.  As we saw last year, that bill passed by the Senate and passed unanimously by the House of Representatives, yet has no fiscal impact on the tax community. We need more jobs.  In addition to the bill, which I am pleased to offer today, I would like to thank the chairman and
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for yielding and for those of us who have worked with him to bring this issue before the Congress.  
Travis Childers. I want to say that my good friend from Florida, Dr. Foxx, is a very thoughtful person, who is very knowledgeable and someone who has a great appreciation for what we're talking about.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 508) to improve the quality of life for pregnant women and for the general public.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows: a) In General.--Section 2 of the Act, which is referred      to as the Family Health and Family Assistance Act, is amended      by adding at the end the following: ``(e) Incentives for Women      Health and Human Services, Act of Congress, 111 Stat. 858, to      reduce the cost and accessibility of healthcare; and       ``(h) Women and Child Welfare.--Section 10 of the Act,      which is referred to as the Family Health and Family      Assistance Act, is amended by adding at the end the      following: ``(I) All children with a low-income      maternal or paternal income greater than $250,000 are      eligible to receive healthcare services.--       ``(2) Incentives

Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Yoho).  I just want to point out, over and over and over and over again, that the Congress has acted, and we have done so. As we have done so for more than 20 years, we have given each State--this is the year after we do this to the States and the Districts of Columbia--our jurisdiction to regulate a variety of foreign entities.  This is a tremendous time for the United States of America. We are not only in the process of legislating, we are in the process of actually considering and passing the Constitution, as the Founders have said. In our country we have taken a step together, but we are now going to legislate as well.  And yet, I have not found a single State with a different interpretation of the Constitution, or, as some have come to think, a different Congress in a different context. We have passed the same piece of legislation, we have done this again for 20 years, and yet we are still doing it again. The question we should be asking, which is where are we going to go in terms of legislating and what we need to do?  So,

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I rise today in support of H.R. 5, the Foreign Investment in the United States Act, to ensure we are going to have an effective foreign investment in our country.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is important, and I wish to express my deep respect for Senator Levin's commitment to building a long-term foreign policy that is based on our values, the values of the United States, and the values of our great Nation, our people. It has always been a priority for my friends across the aisle, and I wish to make sure this issue is not overlooked or ignored.  The bill will strengthen and modernize our relationships in our countries. We must help them develop and move forward in the areas where we want them to continue to grow and prosper. We must move away from our foreign policy preferences that make foreign aid so costly and so wasteful to the United States. As the Senator pointed out, it is important we start focusing on the real issues in order to make sure we can move forward quickly to a new direction to our country.  Madam President, I am pleased to support the Foreign Investment in the United States Act. I thank the Senate for all its work in advancing this legislation and for

Richard Durbin. Madam President, Senator Lieberman and I were both in my district a few years ago and we met in this building. We had a little over 30,000 people at that time and I came to this floor and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee was very pleased that he and I had come here and that we had brought up a bill to deal with these problems and the problem of our government and our veterans.  For a long time, the veterans' families were suffering. There is a lot of talk about it going forward and that the veterans' families, like my friend and colleague and others--the veterans' family that have served here in Washington, D.C., for the last 20 years--are going to continue to suffer. So, today, I rise to talk about the Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee and the veterans in particular.  The American people want to hear that. When President Obama came in last year, he was going to say, ``It's time to take action.'' The 
Richard Durbin. That's right. I hope to see you back again, Senator.  The other thing, Senator, is we are talking about the economy and we are talking about the people we represent. We are talking about health care. What we are discussing is the health care reform bill, and the fact that it passed out of the Appropriations Committee last week as well as the Senate Finance Committee last week, which is about a $1 billion raise over last year. If you are wondering, the health care reform bill that's going on here in the Senate, the health care bill that will be brought up in committee, is going to get sent to the Appropriations Committee to be put into the committee process for another conference report. I understand that.  In fact, we have had a lot of good comments and I understand that, but we also have good discussion about this. It is just a matter of time before we get there. In fact, it is on Friday, at 3 p.m. that we are going to be voting on health care reform legislation, and we are going to be voting on what we believe is a real reform, or at least a real deal--a real deal, as in some of the other proposals--of how we can
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers on both sides.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  
Neil Abercrombie. I thank the gentleman for his concern about what I am discussing in the gentleman's amendment. I want to thank the gentleman for raising the question and asking about this whole subject, especially for that issue.  I do want to be very clear here that the American people, as a nation, as an individual, and as a people, have an obligation to each other, and they do deserve our respect.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to start out by thanking my colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina, for bringing this amendment to the floor. I am happy to be here with him as we consider this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Harkin).  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to a bill that would repeal the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in January. In fact, that bill was signed into law on January 16, just two weeks ago.  I don't think this bill, or any other legislation passed by the House, should be considered as any kind of repeal because the law itself is clear that it is nothing more than a giveaway to the wealthiest Americans. And it is very clear that there is no greater harm for the wealthiest Americans than to be a provider of health insurance.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, not against it; and I ask for its approval.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, on December 13, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, but I did have a few other struggles. It was a disease I came into contact with because I couldn't walk or drive at the time and when I did, I knew I would lose it.  As my daughter's mother and I have been friends, we would sit and chat a little while longer, maybe longer, but I always had to go in and talk to her because I couldn't walk. As her mother and I had the same conversations, I would ask, Oh, you know?  I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, as I was born, but, as a mother, it was not until it became a disease of the kidney. So it took an incredible amount of effort to not only get me to work, but to get this thing done.  The cost of this disease was so expensive. It was so difficult. It was so painful. And so important that we all take a look around us, because of the cost of diabetes, we know that this type of diabetes will be diagnosed.  I was so frustrated and lost that, because I didn't have access to the internet. We didn't have broadband. We didn't have

Harry Reid. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is a lot of work that goes into a bill. There are amendments that are made, as well as votes which I have done, in the Senate. There are amendments that are brought forward, and there is a hearing, a hearing, where there is unanimous agreement that there is something that should be made. The Senator from Washington is being very persistent.  So I oppose the amendment. I support it. I support the amendment. I object.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.  The legislative clerk read as follows:

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 717, the Energy and Water Development Act. The Energy and Water Development Act is a critical step toward the successful long-term economic development of America.  This act requires that the National Environmental Program, or NEPA, be fully funded and that all Federal funds be distributed and allocated to environmental research as a part of the energy portfolio and development activities for the future.  At the same time, this bill authorizes a $500,000 loan to provide funding for energy-related projects.  The Energy and Water Development Act allows for the funding for renewable energy, including the development of solar, wind, geothermal, and geothermal-related hydropower.  This bill supports the Energy and Water Development Agency, or EDAG, by the number of funds made available to projects in an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by the Department of Energy.  It also authorizes the Energy and Water Development Agency to use its own funds to develop and implement programs that address our Nation's energy needs, including the development of clean energy, natural gas, and nuclear energy technologies.  Mr. Speaker, I thank all the cosponsors for these two pieces of

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to speak about this bill.  This bill creates a new $25 billion Federal land trust, which allows Americans to buy and sell real estate on our shores.  Now, it is a good thing that Americans, not only in Alaska but on our islands, should be able to get real estate tax relief that is in their own personal interests. It is a good thing that Americans can also be able to live on Federal lands. It is an example of the difference between real estate and leasing.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Ozsoy) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 178.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, in my community and others around the world, our children and our families are experiencing an epidemic of anxiety and worry. When one parent worried that something was going to happen or that their child was suffering from an emergency, the other parent's reaction is to shut down and not to be there.  One child who is facing this pain is the one whose dad has gone into hospital with an infected leg or a knee or an eye and can't be in the doctor's office. It is one that has already been diagnosed, and it is one that we have had a difficult time with.  That is why our government is working so hard to make sure all of our children and families and our children's families are cared for and that this isn't a partisan issue that is going to distract the Congress and make our children feel alone and not enough.  Mr. Speaker, I support this bill that I introduced yesterday. I have been involved in many legislative sessions over the past year and a half, but this bill is something that I will be proud to do again for the next 5 years.  The bill before us, the Protecting Our Children and Families Act, would require the government to report certain child care claims to

This is one of the few times in a year that we have had an opportunity to vote on this measure.  We have one more year remaining.

I urge my colleagues to work together and oppose this measure.  I think, first, that we should work with the minority leader, who was going to come to the floor in the first place. We are here to work together to find a solution to this problem. I believe I have a point of order against the resolution.  The

In closing, I want to take a minute to reflect on why, in the Congress and in the government, we haven't had much opportunity to work together to address our constituents' concerns on the issue of violence in this country.  We were, frankly, under the control of my Republican friends in Congress, but now we are under Democratic control, which is really a crisis that we are running out of.  It is no small thing to have a disagreement between a Republican and a Democrat, because, yes, I understand that. And I respect that. It has to be that. But this bill is a good solution, which is a solution that is a good solution that is good.  So I yield back the balance of my time.

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a constituent of mine who passed away recently. I know that many of you may have lost something important in life. As someone who worked long hours to help my family, I wanted to share my thoughts on your thoughts, my feelings, and your family in my district.  I was in my first year as a volunteer, working in my home office, where I got a job helping to keep my kids' education funded. During that time, I did some work, where I ran my own business, where I put on a little bit of paperwork, where I started to pay my bills.  I did all of that because I was a parent. So I got involved with people all around the country, which helped me to become the best in my family.  That was a lot of work to do. That was my role. I was always in touch with family, with neighbors, with friends, and with a lot of other people. I was always supportive and loving. I was also involved in trying to find an apartment that my kids would be comfortable with.  I always worked hard for my kids. When I was with my son, who was his second, he was so
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stop the Mortgage Interest Rate Abuse Prevention Act, which will prevent mortgage interest rate abuse through the current mortgage regulatory system.  I have been joined by my good friend, Congressman Jim Clyburn, in introducing this legislation, and this is my strongest congratulations to all of our members.  This bill will, as our bill authorizes, allow the Federal Government to pay interest on mortgages that were held or otherwise adversely affected by this current mortgage system. The goal of this legislation is to help Americans and families find a home that meets their mortgage requirements and is safe, the best value, the safest.  These safeguards are a critical part of our national system that we rely on to keep families' homes safe. To help Americans find the best value in the mortgage market, this legislation funds the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a bipartisan bill that will help families avoid this type of problem.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak on a major issue affecting American families and businesses over the next decade. There is no one more critical to our country and our families than our government.  As the American people come together for a vote, our elected officials are focused on the economy, on jobs, and on providing our children and grandchildren the support they need. At the same time, our elected officials are focused on making sure the American people understand that the Federal Government has a critical role to play in keeping the country strong and that we must not forget it.  This is especially true at the moment when we are facing the most difficult economic time in our Nation's history. We have seen our economy go from a struggling economy to one that is in the grip of a massive, unspeakable and devastating debt.  My constituents, as we move toward the end of this Congress, know that there is no one more critical in the world than our government. In our history, our elected officials have led us forward by helping our constituents and our small businesses the most essential job the American people have in their hearts and their lives.  The U.S. Congress has acted to help our constituents and our businesses throughout the Nation. It

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following remarks be said by the Senate to be followed by a motion to proceed to Calendar No. 467; that no time be taken for debate and further that the remarks of the Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, be printed in the Record.  The

If Senator McConnell is willing to make a call in response to his comments, I do accept that. I am prepared to let him know how he would react if he is willing to allow the Senator from Oklahoma to make a motion to concur.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, it is a day when the Republicans seek to kill this health care bill with all the rhetoric that they want, but they have failed to make it work for a number of reasons. As the Republican leader indicated, we are in negotiations with the President of the United States and with the Republican Conference. In terms of this negotiation, I would like to suggest that we have done a lot of negotiation with the Senate. I think we are going to move ahead in a bipartisan way.  The

Neil Abercrombie. I am very pleased today to yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Broun).  
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chair, I would just say that a recent study concluded that children who eat healthy food for a couple of hours a day are less susceptible to experiencing higher-level adverse effects on their health than children who eat unhealthy foods, which is consistent with research by the University of Pennsylvania.  What we do with this data is this. We have a policy that states that it is best to treat all foods as they are not bad for you, and that is why we have a new law called the Good Health Food and Health Research Act. It is a simple law that is in many parts of the country that we should be taking this step.  Madam Chair, I am not in favor of it, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  
Travis Childers. I thank my colleague, Mr. McAdams, for his remarks.  I rise in strong support of the amendment. The underlying bill does not infringe on the President's right to nominate a single member of the Federal Reserve Board for any postsecondary education, but it does impose burdensome penalties for a handful of Federal Reserve employees that violate the rules of the institution.  I thank my colleagues for their support of this bill and want to congratulate them for their actions.  The President has stated unequivocally that there are no Federal Reserve employees who violate this rule, and as an amendment, I urge my colleagues to vote against it.  The President's Executive order, however, is a travesty. The White House and the White House press accounts indicate that the White House is withholding funding to fund the Reserve and that this funding was placed in a ``defunded trust fund.''  The administration has stated that the White House is delaying this funding. This is contrary to the President's executive order.  In January 2009, the Secretary of the Treasury announced that the White House had received $100 billion from a non-defense budget request. Treasury Director Morgenthau announced that there would be no funding request made to pay for the defense budget. In
Travis Childers. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 658, which calls on our Congress to work to promote comprehensive immigration reform for all Americans.  This resolution is the result of a comprehensive immigration reform bill I introduced in Congress in June.  This bill is a major step forward in reforming our immigration system. It is critical to our country's security, our economic and national security, and the health of our communities. We must work together to do more to address our broken immigration system.  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Childers) that the House suspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 658.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the incredible staff at the Coney Island High School in Lodi, KY. It is a great tribute to the men and women who are being honored this week and every day.  Mr. LIONEL MUNDO. The American Association of State Agencies was proud to welcome the University of Kentucky football coach John Hill to the institution for the second consecutive year. The University is one of Kentucky's top programs and is one of the best football teams in the country.  The University of Kentucky is a member of the top 25 programs in the country. Last year, the university held a national championship game against the Miami University of Miami. The athletic competition was held at the University of Kentucky.  John is one of only 7 players to compete in the NCAA Division II Basketball Final Four, where the NCAA national champions took home the national championship game.  The University of Kentucky has won four national championships, including the 2004 title.  While the University of Kentucky has continued to win national championships every year, the next season will mark the university's third-straight national championship.  The University of Kentucky athletics program has won more national titles and is ranked ninth in conference.  John has represented the country as

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 8) providing for the consideration of H. Con. Res. 8, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.  The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows: Whereas, on December 3, 2009, the United States of America      and Puerto Rico declared a state of emergency and the      Puerto Rico administration rescinded the United States-      Puerto Rico Trade Agreement Agreement Agreement      (UNARTI), which was signed by the President, on October 30,      2009;       Whereas, on November 12, 2009, the United States, through the      United Nations Security Council, issued a proclamation      declaring a State of Emergency, suspending trade relations      with the United States of America and Puerto Rico for      immediate economic reasons, and recognizing a State of      Emergency that could result in disruption and/or loss of      value of goods and services.   
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  The yeas and nays were ordered.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule XX, further proceedings on this motion will be postponed.
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman Smith for his efforts to bring us here today.  The House is facing a long list of problems, not only with the bill, but also with the amendment itself, including the inability of the government to do its work and in the process. And we just spoke about the bill. So it really does take time and not only does it, but that it will also allow for people to have a say.  We had the same discussions with the Republican leaders. They actually were working on a plan, and so they really wanted to have one that got done.  But it seems that some of the provisions in the bill were not going to work, so we would now be taking a decision from the House to actually bring in the bill.  And the gentleman also mentioned the importance of not only ensuring that our families are getting the care they need, but the bill also would require the government to be responsive, which is a tremendous responsibility for the Department of Health and Human Services.  It is important to us. We need it.  In closing, I would remind my colleagues, it was not just the bills that were here today that were here, but it was the bills that have been
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who served our Nation and the State of Texas with the dedication and tenacity that he so graciously demonstrated as an infantry soldier.  Bill Graves and his men were deployed to the Texas-Mexico border during the Civil War in the middle of the fighting. They were the ultimate soldiers to bring to America and bring to their families an appreciation of the freedom of which they are a part.  Bill's men were the ultimate warrior. They fought with a relentless tenacity and determination unlike any other who served in our Armed Forces. They worked hard for everything they could, in spite of hardships.  Bill's men fought like any other American soldier, and their strength and determination never faltered. We honor them with the best of intentions, in spite of the hardships of their deployment.  I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Bill for his service. I know that Bill's commitment will continue to be long-lasting.  Mr. Speaker, the memory of Bill Graves, our hero, remains a shining, true-silver piece of stone, one that will be passed down with love and admiration from generations to generations. 
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this important legislation to support the Children's Health Insurance Program Act of 2016.  Our Nation has been impacted as a result of the tragedy of the 2013 terrorist attack on our nation's Capital, where at least 12 people were killed.  This year, the Children's Health Insurance Program Act would have provided coverage to 12,700 more people, providing nearly $5 billion in financial benefits to more than 2,000 children from across the United States.  This bill, sponsored by my colleague, the gentlelady from New York (Ms. Norton), will provide additional assistance to more than 1,500 people who were at the same risk, including families affected by the tragedy. It will allow parents to purchase health insurance to keep their kids from being ``deceived or mistreated.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from New York is recognized for her tireless work and dedicated words on behalf of all who support and support the Children's Health Insurance Program Act of 2016.

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, the American people have been begging the government for a lot of time. I heard the majority leader and Senator Reid talk about a serious problem. I will never forget those days and, more importantly, the days during the Senate markup.  As a Senator, I believe in what I said at the time. I am proud to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I wish to congratulate the majority leader and Senator Reid for their incredible leadership.  As we have just seen on the House side of the aisle, we have to remember that we are talking about a real problem. We are not talking about a Republican President. We are talking about a Republican Congress. It is a big problem. It is one that is going to get us to a point that can change in the way we are elected.  We have a long way to go. It is going to change as we go on the legislative process. We have a long way to go. Our colleagues across the aisle will tell you that what we are talking about is that, once you run into problems, we must do the work.  This is what I call the long way. This is what is happening with our country. This is the kind of legislation that people have been

I do want to thank the President and the Democrats for doing the right thing and doing it with a bipartisan path forward.  The people of Illinois are on the brink. It is hard to think of anyone in the State of Illinois, one of the most important industries of the State, as so many Illinoisans are looking for jobs but have to be told that if they don't get a job, they are going to be denied by Washington, D.C., to fill a new position and even start a new business.  I thank the President and the Democratic leaders for doing what is their constitutional duty. I also thank the chairman for being willing to talk about jobs, jobs, jobs. It was so difficult for me to see any other Member who was there as part of that conversation, and I hope they will continue to do so, but I do want to thank Chairman Levin and the entire Democratic caucus.  The only thing I have to say about the new jobs program is that it was a win for me. I am grateful for the Democratic leadership and for the hard work of
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to say that I agree with the gentleman's sentiments. And that is that, Mr. Chairman, it's very easy to say that we shouldn't be paying for any services for the people. If I could, and if I could ask someone to share what's in their contract, I would.  But the gentleman doesn't understand what is in their contract. The gentleman just makes a case that is very difficult, and that's what this is about.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia, and I rise in opposition to this amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is correct.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Burgess) having assumed the chair, Mr. Thompson, Acting Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5876) to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service as the Washington Post Building No. 6, and authorizing the Secretary of the Postal Service to issue a rule making it immediately available to all post offices in the United States, and having further agreed that, if the United States Postal Service, having the right to designate the building with reference to a national building, is ordered to comply with all applicable laws, including by reference to the National Building Standards, which in this bill is to be known as the `Washington Post Building Standards.' The second reading of the bill was ordered.
Travis Childers. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the legislation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the IRS.  I thank my colleague and fellow law clerk, Mr. Gosar, for his excellent, thoughtful, and thoughtful work to address this important issue.  While I do not oppose the amendment, I want to assure Members that this is a straightforward and straightforward amendment, and it will have the same impact as the underlying legislation that was adopted.  I do not oppose the amendment, and I urge Members to support it.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks. He talked a bit about the American people, about the debt, the debt that we've all been fighting for, and the debt that we have here today that we've no longer have before us, and how we've become dependent upon the United States. He has touched a very important area.  As I have talked to some of my colleagues, I have heard them say that the American people are the greatest nation on the planet, and they're the most powerful. In fact, we've seen a decline of the United States debt; we've seen a reduction in the debt that we have. It's very important that we understand what the debt is, and that we talk to the American people as much as we can, as we can when we're in charge of them. It's not the American people who are the driving forces, the ones in charge of how we're going to grow in the world and how we need to get out of the debt.  Now, I have been here the last several times for just over 30 years, and I can tell you that the country that we've got now that we know how to deal with this debt will see a
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the Public Health and Education Fund Act of 2009, because in many parts of the country children's schools are currently failing and that they are at risk for child-related health issues.  The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCEME) and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children (MCLC) have both recently published a report titled ``An analysis of the effects of the public-private system on the health of children with missing or missing-child services.''  Our work demonstrates that public-private health-care systems provide critical services and are essential to the success of children and their families.  H.R. 6 expands and improves upon the Public Health and Education Fund Act's Public Health Services and Development program, which allows a child to receive services in a publicly funded setting.  We applaud the work of the Office of Community and Developmental Counsel and the Office of School Counsel to establish the NCDC for Children and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children to provide services to over 10,000 children.  It is critical that our constituents are aware of the need for a public health and education fund that will

He has a wonderful plan for us, a plan for America to get our economy back on track and on track, and he is doing that. He is doing it for us and for the people of our country.  This year, the national debt will be $2.7 trillion. If we give the President credit for what he has done, we can get it to the $2.7 trillion, as the Republican leader indicated. As I said earlier, it is a lot of money, not too much money, but it is going to be there in the coming weeks.  So I would like to take some time just to say that I do think this is a very difficult decision, not a pretty one for me, not a very good one for the Republican leader. I thank the chairman for his help, the majority leader for his cooperation.  
Neil Abercrombie. I am very pleased to join with my colleague, Chairman Himes, in recognizing the fact that the United States has always been an indispensable part of the world economy. It is time that we recognize our role.  It is a good thing that the United States has been the leading player in this area. It is a good thing that the President and the House are both working together on the issue of health care.  It is also good news that the Senate, in the form of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has received many letters from people on both sides of the aisle urging us to be very clear about how we will be working together.  The President is a great man and an expert in science, and the Senate needs him. So I am very pleased that we have this opportunity to have this opportunity, that we will be able to get this done and that we will have it in a more timely manner in the next few days.  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for your friendship and your bipartisan nature.

This is a bipartisan issue, and I am happy to support their efforts on this critical bill.  I support this bill because it makes life easier, which is critical for our Nation. There are many ways we can improve this bill, and the gentlewoman's proposal is one of the few. She's working on the same.  I appreciate your efforts on this important bill, and I thank you for your efforts on this bill and to say to all of those who support you: Don't pass this bill. Don't do it.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, this year the President has signed into law the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is one of the safest and fastest-growing cleanest transportation paths in the world.  Now, nearly 50 years later, this pipeline will be about to be completed, and it is already moving through our southern border, where it is used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as an intercontinental ballistic missile.  We know that there are countless problems, but this pipeline is a clear example of what we can do with the rest of America's transportation and energy policy.  The legislation that will be passed today is a critical piece of legislation for the Keystone XL Pipeline, and it ensures there is no delay for thousands of businesses. The pipeline provides access to hundreds of billions of dollars in capital investments, and this legislation makes sure the pipeline will be protected from environmental damage by being able to be built at a cost of only $1 billion a day and built safely.  This legislation also is good news for the energy producers in my district, where the pipeline is expected to finish in 10 to 15 years. That will put an even stronger position on our economy.

I rise to oppose the legislation and to discuss how it would affect our air service in the United States.

As I have said, this is a historic moment for the Second District, and it is one I will remember for a long time as this is our last day on the floor.  We all have a responsibility to support the Federal Government and to do our job, and this is an opportunity to make a difference to so many communities throughout this country.  We lost a young American hero, Robert B. Baird. I cannot imagine a more deserving and inspiring man. And I believe it is with his service to this Nation that I know I have lived for decades. And I am humbled that our Nation still stands in the way of the service and sacrifice made by his family.  I would like to take a moment to thank him and his family for making this great day possible and for allowing this historic moment to happen. It is an honor to pay tribute to the American hero who took the lives of so many people who lost a loved one. He was a man who loved his community, and he never knew anyone better than his own life.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker,
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, the most recent news story for this floor this morning said a lot about the lack of access to care. I would like to share a few quotes from a few of my friends who were there.  One, Mr. Speaker, I said, you can't run a business in a city, in a business that's open and closed. You have to get your paperwork done in a reasonable time. But if you can't come to the office--or if you have a health plan, or if you get sick at the office, you go to the doctor who can do that for you, not the insurance company, not the doctor that knows that you have a preexisting condition. So you run a small business because you are going to have a problem, and it would be a hardship for you to have to go through this to the other health-care organizations in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I think this point is well-intentioned. It is, I think, correct. The fact is, it is not the time for this bill to end.  The American people are hurting. They are hurting because, in fact, this bill, this Congress, the Republican bill, is the only real measure
Travis Childers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I rise today in support of H.R. 4, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. This is a bipartisan bill that I strongly support, and I hope you will join me as my fellow cosponsors in support of this measure.  I have been deeply concerned about the excessive efforts and delays of workers at the AFL-CIO's National Trade Union. I have been told by many in the AFL-CIO and by my colleagues that the AFL-CIO is no longer the leading union in the United States and is only trying to make it easier for its employees. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 makes clear that workers will be able to receive fair, independent, and effective representation from unions. This bill would expand this vital protections for workers--not to mention ensure workers get access to representation for the important services their bosses demand from them--as well as make sure unions receive fair and independent representation from the entire State of Indiana.  In addition to these important benefits, workers will also receive free healthcare and benefits which are earned by the public in the form of an annual salary, free education, and health insurance. This is a vital benefit to the State of Indiana.  Mr. Chairman,

On Friday, the House met in a meeting where they were able to bring the two bills together on one subject. That is not a perfect example of the way that the House has treated her.  Madam Chair, the process I have been having throughout my career in the House of Representatives has been to move forward and bring amendments and provisions to the floor, and that is exactly what we are going to do tonight.

I also rise to congratulate the American Legion Post Office, which has recently been recognized by the Office of Veterans Affairs in recognition of its outstanding service to the American Legion.  To say that the American Legion is honored by our veterans is to be commending the American Legion Post Office. It is the highest-level, most prestigious branch of the American Legion. It is the highest-level and most honorable branch of the American Legion.  As we have witnessed as our veterans have fought in their respective wars, we have seen firsthand the courage that they showed for their fellow veterans. And while our veterans have given great sacrifices, we still believe, in the words of the American Legion's founding statement, that our service

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, we had a very unique day with the great Kentuckians. For one, when we were here in the Senate, Senator Alexander and Senator Paul came up to talk about the need for a good tax hike. We were talking about the need to provide some tax relief for small businesses and middle class families. So Kentuckians and all Americans came together to address that, and it is in fact a very serious concern.  As a Senator, I stand with my colleagues across the aisle in a way that I think will help our constituents in our communities and strengthen their businesses, and that will help the economy. I want the American people to understand that we are here to serve a purpose and to make sure they are having the certainty they need to succeed.  I will talk about the jobs that have been created here. As a Senator, I think we had some very significant jobs, and I have a lot of things going on here that will have economic impact, but we have a lot of jobs that are going to be created.  There were a lot of reasons why this would happen. We had several hearings with the Governor of Kentucky. I heard from the Governor that he was looking for things to do, so we went to talk

I would like to begin my work with them, and I would like to join them to discuss their legacy in order. As we speak, they have left a legacy. The Panthers are no stranger to their struggles. It is easy to see the strength of the Panthers, the pride of the entire community. In their case, there were 12 Panthers who helped shape the story of that entire history.  One of those 12 Panthers, I met with, was Jim Wilson, the former mayor of Rapid City, IL. Jim is a dedicated and tireless human being, dedicated to the people of Rapid City. I had the privilege to meet Jim at a basketball game in Rapid City on January 9, 2010. He had been the head coach there for 20 years, and he was one of the first African-American people to play for the University of South Dakota, and he has been the coach for the University of South Dakota University basketball team. As the senior assistant coach of the University of South Dakota basketball team, Jim was a terrific man, a consummate athlete, a
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  
Neil Abercrombie. The first reason that we do not understand is because the bill that is before us today is an attempt to have that be the next step. It is an attempt to get to the next step in trying to make sure that the next person is the next person.  I am happy to yield.  
Travis Childers. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize two wonderful families for giving a blessing to their fellow Americans, their daughters, their granddaughters and their step-sisters in the United States, and for their continued success.  After being crowned as the United States' sixth-place finisher at the 2010 World AIDS Conference, Madam Speaker, David Martin lost his life on March 14, 2009, in my hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio.  His death is a great loss to the Commonwealth of the Cincinnati, and in the world's most important democracy, and as President-Elect Donald Trump said, ``I'm going to tell you this: It's going to be a great life.''  David Martin was a loving father, his sister, and his wife.  As a teacher and as a physician, I was a life-long advocate for the rights of the people, and the rights of the American people, and as a member of the Cincinnati NAACP, I am honored to represent the many communities in my district that make him a life-long champion for them.  Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the people of our Nation, the citizens of our great State, and the people of the United States, all of whom are
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, the rule makes it easier to send mail than to make phone calls, and the rule also requires us to pay for the cost of processing those phone calls.  For that reason, it is of great significance to me that the House adopted a rule this week that allows mail to be processed at a time to be used by our troops and to ensure that our troops are serving in safe and secure locations.  A day or two before the Capitol Visitor Center is closed to the public, there are two things that I wanted to discuss today.  First of all, our troops are not the only ones who face this challenge. We have soldiers in Afghanistan who have faced a difficult time, and we have soldiers in Iraq who have faced tremendous hardships.  What is most concerning about the war is that the United States, our allies, and our fellow Americans have been sending us in many different, diverse ways--even our troops--to fight and to provide aid to these brave men and women. We are not the only ones who face this challenge. As we enter the new year, and while we know that we are finally at the end of the fiscal year, it is important that we continue to work with our military partners to ensure that
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20th anniversary of the New York City Council to give recognition to the city's people and place in history as a place that stands on the shoulders of giants in the history of our country.  In the city's history, it was the Manhattanite and the City of Brooklyn that was the city. And I came to the city to serve as a representative for this noble cause, and I would say that as a mayor, the city has always been in the forefront of people's minds.  In the 20th century, this city was the birthplace of the successful social movements, the democratic movement, and the growth of the Industrial Revolution in America and throughout the world. In the city of Brooklyn, the Industrial Revolution had become more and more significant, and in the mid-1960s, the city lost many members of its political leadership, many of its people, and its people became increasingly hostile to the democratic ideals of the city of Brooklyn.  As you will see in the history of Brooklyn and the city of Brooklyn, there are few people left to speak for the citizens of the city that were inspired by the principles of the Industrial Revolution.  Now, however, some of the city
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I rise to call attention to the recent tragedy of the Armenian genocide.  A year ago, it was the U.S. and Israel that took the lives of more than 2.3 million Armenians and their families. Today, the United States and the Armenians hold an important role in this horrific conflict.  This is the day when our government has been made to make a promise to the world to condemn the genocide. In fact, President Obama has stated that the U.S. will only come back with more genocide cases as soon as Iran and Syria allow their nuclear capabilities to be put in a future nuclear Iran, the same deal that gave us nuclear weapons and unleashed the Assad regime in Syria.  The Obama administration did this and called on the world to give Israel an alternative. Israel is now required to come forward with an agreement to prevent their nuclear proliferation; yet Iran and Syria are not going to get the same response as before.  In the coming days and months, this must become more important. The United States will not only have to send our troops, but this can be done through a stronger bilateral partnership, a partnership that will lead us to greater peace, a more prosperous life for the people

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corker, my Republican colleague, for his very hard work on this bill. I have also had the great honor of knowing our friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Wyden.  He is a friend and an ally of mine in Congress, and he is my friend and my partner in getting this bill passed. He is a great President.  This bill is an important step forward. It is a step forward for me. I thank Senator Corker. I also want to thank Senators Warner, Udall, and Cornyn, and also Senator Stabenow for their bipartisan work on the amendment. This is a bipartisan bill.  I yield the floor.  The

Neil Abercrombie.  Madam Speaker, on rollcall No. 563, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no.''  
Neil Abercrombie. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4173, the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act, and H.R. 5447, the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act.  This bill will help us improve our system of funding for VA hospitals, providing for health care services at the VA medical centers, reducing the number of VA's veteran-owned facilities, and decreasing medical waste and abuse at VA medical centers.  It is not an unreasonable thing to say that we should be reducing the number of VA hospitals at all medical facilities. This bill, which has been introduced by Congressman DeSantis, has made very strong claims that these facilities are the most effective medical facilities for veterans.  This bill also calls on Congress to make funding the responsibility of the VA health care system a priority. As chair of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I strongly supported the bipartisan efforts of the House to address VA's duplicative medical facilities.  H.R. 4173 addresses these goals with an updated version of the bill. It has bipartisan support.  The VA's medical facilities are being treated in areas such as mental health care and physical rehabilitation, which will help keep the VA
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1742) to amend the Election Assistance Commission Act of 1971 to require the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education to submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of educational and cultural interventions that involve the establishment and evaluation of culturally and linguistically significant instructional practices.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows: a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Educated populations and educational institutions generally,      including minority-serving institutions, have the greatest      educational risk to our Nation's economy, and to its      future prosperity.       (2) The quality of education is a Nation's greatest      economic priority, with over a quarter of all children      receiving school and college educations, compared to nearly      5 percent of all children.       (3) Educational institutions and their educational      activities are responsible for promoting a culture of      diversity
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I want to recognize an amazing human being. In the past month, over 1,000 volunteers, children and adults have taken the lead in caring for those in need and helping to end the current crisis in our country. This summer, we are considering the very important National Children's Emergency Hospital Children's Emergency Care Program.  Today we are at the center of the Children's Hospital Emergency and Health Care Response and Coordination Program. This program provides pediatric emergency medicine patients in our state with emergency care, and provides emergency medical services to children and young adults who have become addicted. This program helps them receive the care they need when it comes to chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart and lung disease, or pediatric diabetes.  The Children's Hospital Emergency and Health Care Response and Coordination Program has been in operation for 3 years. These programs continue to provide pediatric emergency care to children and young adults.  This program has served more than 500,000 patients at Children's Hospital. The Children's Hospital Emergency and Health Care Response and Coordination Program has more than 100,000 patients across the State of Texas.  I commend Chairman Lowey and my colleagues for being so gracious. I look forward to working with them as they continue their
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule, the rule that is scheduled to be voted on by the House on November 29, and I stand with my colleagues and with the American people to ensure the rule will not be defeated.  This is not an up-or-down vote. We should be voting to repeal this flawed law by eliminating the provision that funds unemployment benefits and the unemployment insurance mandate.  Mr. Speaker, we should be voting to repeal this flawed law by eliminating the provision that funds unemployment benefits and the unemployment insurance mandate.  Mr. Speaker, this rule does not deal with the plight of families whose incomes fall below the limit on their benefits. The rule only addresses the problem that is at the root of their economic challenges. The issue is one that has to be addressed with a commonsense way.  The rule should not be used to repeal the so-called ``job-killing'' law that would raise the national debt. The rule is no different. It should be used to provide certainty to families with a choice. That choice should be about how we move forward in a way that makes the American people aware that a family is in fact in need of relief, and that will make our economy

Madam President, it was a great victory for the Senate, and I want to thank the chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and Senator Landrieu and the ranking member of the Banking Committee for making it so that the debate on the confirmation of the nomination of John R. Sanders to be U.S. circuit judge is just a short while ago.  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the House, by a voice vote, proceed to the consideration of the S. Res. 19 resolution.  The 
Harry Reid. I am now in morning business.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.  
Richard Durbin. Will the Senator yield for a question about the fact that the Senator from Illinois is in the same building as the Senator from New Jersey?  
Richard Durbin. I would ask that the President be recognized, not only on the occasion of the inauguration, but on the occasion of the passage of the first budget legislation, the omnibus bill that was passed earlier that we have not yet done a CBO score on.  
Neil Abercrombie. I thank the gentleman for the kind words and comments that he has brought forward in support of this bill. It goes to our hearts, our deepest appreciation, that our country will never tolerate another day like the one that it took to pass the Keystone XL Pipeline that would have been a wrecking ball for America's energy security. It's time for us to get serious about energy security.  
Neil Abercrombie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.  In your words: I agree with your chairman's words.  But as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I feel that the gentleman has gone too far. He has not been transparent on his amendments.  It is not the first time that you have given an opportunity to your committee. I've worked with him on his amendments, and I think this has been a productive partnership. It has been a process that we've worked on many, many different ways. We've worked on amendments on the floor many different ways. We've been able to work with him on the various amendments and amendments, and I know he has been a terrific partner.  He also has the opportunity to serve on our committee, and he knows that the gentleman knows that we have an obligation to look at what he can offer, and that is a balanced approach.  I appreciate your taking me and my staff into consideration for a number of years now to continue to work with the gentleman.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the passing of Mary Katherine Fox, an honorary sergeant major of the United States Army.  Born in New Orleans, N.Y., in 1887, Mary Katherine Fox served as an African-American infantry officer during the Great War.  At the time of the outbreak of war, Mary Katherine Fox was a native of Alabama. She was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1899 and served with distinction during the First World War. She served as a first sergeant and was subsequently called to the Army Reserve.  During World War II, Mary Katherine Fox served her patriotic duty in France, where she became known as the most feared African-American soldier.  From a young age, Mary Katherine Fox's training provided her with the opportunity to serve with skill and dedication, and she was awarded the Legion of Merit from the South as a graduate of the University of Alabama.  After the war, Mary Katherine Fox became a member of the Mississippi Delta Service, where she was assigned to Headquarters Air Force, where she served as an aircraft officer.  She was elected to the Alabama State Senate in 1976 and then served as chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Committee.  I would like to take
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Tipton) for bringing this legislation to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6098, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.  The title of the bill was amended so as to read:  H.R. 6098, as amended, to read as follows:  A measure to amend title 13, United States Code, to      establish a National Drug Strategy for Fiscal Year 2012,      including new research that aims to use bio-based      pharmacists as tools to monitor, coordinate, and improve      research on the role of drugs and other trace elements in      humans, animals and human health, and the potential to      use biologics
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, it is past time to go back to our current situation, and, unfortunately, the majority leader is not coming back to address the Senate, so I just want to say I am happy to support the legislation that we have been having on the floor.  It is an issue that affects every single American, and we have made some efforts to address it. The fact that this bill passed is actually a good step in the right direction, and we ought to be doing better as we try to do the right things, including reducing tax increases.  But the reality is, this is one thing that, as the President said, we don't want to do. This is another thing that, as the President said, we don't want to do. I am glad the House passed this bipartisan bill, and I think it is what we need to do. And I want to thank Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Kuster for bringing this bill to the floor of the House.  And so, Madam Speaker, I thank the President for having a voice for what we should all do in the Senate, and I would say that we are taking it back now to the Senate and, unfortunately, this is on the House floor
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for yielding and for his leadership, and I want to congratulate him on his tenure as our ranking member of the Budget Committee.  Mr. Speaker, this budget proposal represents one of my more modest cuts of $5.7 billion in the Federal budget, $5.2 billion less than what my colleague from Wisconsin said.  The first step is to eliminate the wasteful spending cuts by adding more than $4 billion to the national debt, and we must do so as well.  But while we will be paying our debt for more than $5 trillion, we can't borrow more than that. We must spend more than we can borrow. The current budget has been about the balance, not the deficit.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, last week a group of Kentucky veterans' groups gathered at my home in Lexington, Kentucky, for a vigil on April 21. They called on a group of Kentucky veterans to unite in unity to protest gun violence and to raise awareness about gun violence and to keep the lives of those in their care, their families, and the people they love at the top of their lungs.  My State, Kentucky, is home to a strong veteran-owned economy, a thriving middle class, and a proud post-World War II society. While many Kentucky veterans are not employed, there are millions of Kentuckians who work hard every day to make ends meet and make a difference in the lives of their fellow veterans.  I was among those who responded. I was impressed. I met many veterans' representatives, and I saw the courage of so many of them. I know we all are grateful and grateful for the sacrifice of those who have made a difference in Kentucky.  Today marks the first time in years I have met one of my constituents who is an American hero and a friend. My constituents are committed to their service, and they understand the sacrifices they make.  The National Guard National Memorial in Louisville will be honoring the first responders of our
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a dear friend, the late Senator Chuck Schumer, who has passed on to his sonhood for a lifetime.  Chuck was born into a powerful family and has lived through a tough time in Washington. It is an understatement to say, he is one of those rare individuals who has made good friends and friends, and we are lucky to have him.  Chuck is an incredible leader in the Senate, and it is an honor to congratulate him on this occasion. He has been a steadfast leader in the Senate and on the floor, and I know he has served us all.  On his birthday in February of 2020, Chuck will be here on the floor to tell a story of his time as Senator Schumer's son, an event which has changed his life and brought people together.  Chuck Schumer's dad Bill worked very hard in his son's congressional office as a staffer, and he always had the ability to help out his father. Bill was a good dad, and Chuck worked very hard in his father's office in a tough, demanding role. But Chuck has always been a steadfast leader. He has worked tirelessly and with great conviction.  Chuck's first job was a clerk for the Senate Judiciary Committee in a tough

Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the government takeover of Medicare. There is no better way to reduce the risk of serious illnesses in our healthcare system than the health plan under consideration. We know that under these circumstances, health care decisions, even the biggest ones, should be taken with care, not with suspicion, without a reason. I would like to see this bill be debated today on the floor.  Let me also say that this process can be quite confusing for many of our colleagues here, because in my home district, people across the State, families from all walks of life, families that struggle with their health care decisions, people in communities across my district who are concerned that they can no longer afford to pay for a government-run health plan, people in my district who feel the need to take health care away from them, people on the other side of the aisle who are afraid to go to the doctor because of their health care decisions. I don't like those stories. I feel like the Presiding Officer has got to say they are in shock. They are.  I strongly support these proposals, and I strongly support the Republican plan, because, at the end of the day, if you want a plan that focuses

This is an issue that affects American families, not just for our great Nation, but for families all across this country. My thoughts and prayers are with my constituents as they pay tribute to the sacrifices they have made for a good cause.  I was a veteran in World War II, I served in the U.S. Navy, and I served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, with today's legislation, my heart has not been broken. I hope my colleagues across the aisle join me in voting in strong support of H.R. 578, the America for Every Child Act, to reauthorize the U.S. National Child Care Center.  As the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Workplace Safety, Health and Human Services, and Education, I am proud to say that my constituents who work in these areas are now able to participate in this vital program. I thank the chairman for bringing this important legislation to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 578 will help protect America's children. It has proven to be an invaluable tool in the fight against child abuse and neglect.  It is not just about the American children
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call attention to the horrific tragedy at St. Luke's High School in St. Louis. On Friday, September 10, this terrible tragedy occurred. As St. Louis public schools continue their relentless attack on our students, they should remember that we are a nation of laws.  The victims of this attack include young adults, many of whom are in their sixties, who are also in their seventies, and the families and educators whose lives have been touched by the events. They are suffering, but also they are suffering greatly as students and families are struggling to find safe homes in places such as St. Louis.  On behalf of the school board and the entire St. Louis community, I call attention to this horrific act and urge all of our staff to immediately put together and distribute letters of support to school administrators, teachers, and their families.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield 1 minute to our great colleague from Minnesota, Representative Ryan. 
Gokberk Ozsoy. I want to recognize the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kildee) for his distinguished leadership on this issue, and for his support of this measure.  Mr. KILDEE. I thank the gentleman for his good work.  I would also like to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bacon), who is from my district, who is a former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who has taken the time to look over his shoulder, and who has been such a valuable partner. Mr. BACON. I thank the gentleman for his great work.  I also want to point out one other thing that Mr. Kildee said just before his appointment is: We have the responsibility of protecting this Congress. We have the responsibility of protecting this Congress. There are plenty of American families that will look at us today. In fact, the most vulnerable people of the United States are at the very moment, with the greatest number of children and young women today. They are so vulnerable. The children and their parents are not as vulnerable because it is a matter of public health and safety.  Now, the Republican budget makes a lot of sense, but the issue of our health and safety is so important that Republicans need

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking the Senators for the time and energy that we have had in dealing with the health care problem that we had in this particular part of this country, and also in the need to help those who have been injured or have been disabled as a result of this.  I know my friends are very passionate on this particular piece of legislation. They have been on it for years, and it has been bipartisan. I am honored to have had the privilege of working with them in an attempt to get this legislation passed as well, which in the end, was something the Republican leader and I, the Democratic leader, thought we would never get to. But at some point in our own caucus, we did have a situation where we saw in this one case a group that had been injured and sustained a spinal cord injury. They did not even have the ability to speak for themselves. We found the doctors and doctors we needed to go to. We had a lot of problems with the medical system because the government did not allow the doctors and the providers to have access to the doctors and the doctors to deal with the medical equipment, and it was the doctors that got the equipment, the patients, and the care.

Harry Reid. Madam President, I wish to give an accounting of the Republican side-by-side on this bill. We have received several calls from the Republican leadership--not very often--from Republican Senators who are in Washington. We have gotten letters from other Senators who have expressed their concern that the House is moving ahead. We have even received a letter from the President of the United States who said that he wants to move forward.  There are a number of issues here--including issues that are very important to the country. I am a strong believer that we have to focus on the right things. That is the Republican Party in this country. I am very disappointed that the Republican leadership seems to want to get more out of this House.  We have heard from some Members that have spoken out, but that is exactly what is happening here. If we do not move on, the Republican leadership will have a lot to work on as we move on--not just one word from them but from the Republican leaders in this House. They want us to move on, to move on. They want us to move on and get our bill done.  So I want to thank the Republican leadership. I think there is more than one way to do this. It is to
Harry Reid. Mr. President, the Senate should be debating two bills on which we agree: the motion to proceed to H.R. 2775, and the motion to proceed to H.R. 2776. I wish to begin by saying that the Senate should vote on the motion to proceed.  Before voting on the motion to proceed, I want to say that, as the two bills have both passed the Senate and on a motion to invoke cloture on the bill, I believe we need to vote on H.R. 2776. This is a very important piece of legislation--not just for the Senate but for the economy of the country and for America. This bill is the largest single measure in the Senate.  In recent years, the economy of the country is on the verge of going into a recession, and the Federal Government has not gotten enough out of the economy to provide sufficient financial assistance. The country was hit by an economic downturn that lasted decades, and the Congress has been working hard to address the problem.  I am a very firm believer in the need for robust economic recovery. That is why we have two bills that need to be passed. That is why we must pass H.R. 2776.  As a matter of fact

I want to give her an opportunity to say a few words about the impact the Federal Government has had on our economy and our country. I know many in the Senate are already well aware of the effects that the Federal Government has had on our economy and on our economy's environment. I want to address this issue and talk about it, just as I would do when we were in session.  Last week, during an interview with a newspaper in Springfield, IL, I asked Senator Hatch, in the morning, if he was concerned about the impact of Federal funding on the economic health of the people of our country. We talked about the need for reform that would include higher spending in our Tax Code and a reduction in Federal corporate subsidies. That is all part of the discussion.  I wanted to say I had concerns with how the Federal Government's spending on our roads and bridges may have been going forward. I wanted to say that the bill which was submitted in the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I have been a cosponsor, was very relevant. I am very glad it was put on the floor of the Senate.  Let
Neil Abercrombie. This weekend, the House passed the Energy bill. In fact, this week the Senate passed a bill that has already passed the Senate, and that is why I think our children deserve a chance to go back home. We need to ensure that all Americans are given an opportunity to get the full coverage they deserve.
Neil Abercrombie. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and legacy of a true American patriot, a young man who put his life into service to the people of North Carolina.  I am honored to be the first and only sponsor of the Fallen North Carolinians program, which honors and honors American exceptional young men and women who have done so much for the Nation and will be remembered as patriots, heroes, and survivors.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Perry).  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the bill.  This bill does nothing to help the private sector or the American public save from the damage caused by an environmental disaster that threatens our climate. But to the millions of Americans, the American people, and our economy all across this country, I must say the public and the State must do what is right for America.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am that we are on the floor today and that the American people are saying: Make no mistake; that the climate catastrophe is real and not just a hoax; that it is real, it is real, it is real, and it will get real.  Climate change is not a hoax, but it is a real problem. It is a problem that we must address in a way that will allow us to find solutions that will provide certainty, that will create jobs, that will get Americans and the American people back to work, that will save lives and livelihoods, and help build our economy.  So let me tell you something. Let's get out of here. Let's act like it is the real science here in Washington. Let's stand together with the American people. Let's lead the way
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I would simply urge the gentlelady to have an open and transparent process about her upcoming resolution, and that is a good one.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, we have worked on two bills now. We have worked on a long-term continuing resolution, and we have worked on three continuing resolutions. We will soon have a bill at the desk.  But we do have other issues and some very important work. This week, we have some very important work, work that we hope will be done within the next several days. If we can work it out in the days ahead, I think it will be a very good beginning.  The

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins for his extraordinary leadership in our country this week. It has been very easy to see the depth of the concern here in the Senate. I look forward to the Senate on Friday, which will be great. I hope, as I hear the news from the other side of the aisle that they are not taking up so much as a proposal to fund an entirely new program that is being made available, yet another funding bill that will actually cost so much more to the country, which is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the money that will ultimately be spent on these programs.  I am delighted that this is an effort that the Senate will have a chance to vote on very soon--not only with respect to its appropriations bills--but, finally, in a bipartisan way with a bipartisan bill. I am excited to see it pass out of the Senate floor this week.  I wish to thank Senator Collins and Senator Durbin for their leadership, for working so hard to bring the bill that we are going to vote on this afternoon. This is one of the most important, and I think it is a tremendous contribution to the way our country has worked its way through the Senate. It is such a wonderful experience. 
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, we are in this together. We are in this together as a people. That is why we have our conference, we have our conference committee that is here on the floor that represents the people of this State.  There has been great concern, Madam Speaker, about the cost of this CR as a result of the Affordable Care Act, of the lack of funding in the Affordable Care Act.  The reason we are here in the committee is because of the fact that this President has said in our Nation's capital city that the Affordable Care Act will keep the government open. We have asked that we find this problem. What we found is that in some cases, as the President has said, there have been instances where a government has failed or broken this. I just don't think that this is the reason we are here.  I will tell you, Madam Speaker, the reason I am here today, which is to address the problems that exist in this Chamber, is the fact that there are times when we find some time that we want to be able to do this because there are certain moments where we can and should be able to do this, such as this or the fact that there are cases where we can take
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on Economic Opportunity and, as the distinguished chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am proud to rise to commend the American Center for Entrepreneurship, an international nonprofit dedicated to increasing small business access to the public, public sector, and national economy through a national strategy.  The American Center for Entrepreneurship is an educational organization that provides a training program for business owners on how to grow their businesses and their small businesses. The American Center for Entrepreneurship is headquartered in my district of New York. The American Center for Entrepreneurship develops, builds, and publishes publications to support its mission of enabling small businesses to prosper, creating jobs and providing access to capital to increase the economy of its States.  A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the growth of small businesses in the United States is fueled by more than $1 trillion in annual new investment generated by small businesses. This is a sign that the U.S. economy needs bolder ways to grow and expand and expand. The American Center for Entrepreneurship is an example of an organization founded in the early
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this bill, which will allow small businesses to create a program that supports their workforce by creating jobs for their employees.  This bill will help create jobs for businesses. With small businesses, they are able to create more employment for their employees.  I am a firm believer that small businesses are the engine that powers the economy and drives innovation, creativity and economic growth. They can do this with hard-working American businesses and with our constituents. It is a powerful message that they can bring back their livelihoods for generations to come.  And it is important that we protect this important program for our small business owners. While this is a bipartisan bill, we must keep this important legislation as a part of the larger solution to a growing problem, as it has been on the House floor for about 2 years now.  I want to congratulate Chairman Lowey on his successful leadership, and I look forward to working with my friend from Kentucky, Representative Simpson, and others in the House on a strong and comprehensive solution to our small business owner.  This bill is a step towards fulfilling our obligation to small businesses. I look forward to working with my friends on the other side of the aisle to strengthen our workforce,
Travis Childers. Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1162, honoring the 50th anniversary of the Red Sox. Today I wish to recognize the Red Sox's 75th anniversary of celebrating the 50th anniversary of winning the American League Championship Series and the 150th time in the history of the National League.  Since the conclusion of World Series play in 1986, the Red Sox have lost seven World Series games and, this year, faced a 4-1 victory in Game 7 of the World Series. And yet, it is the American League that should be the focal point of this celebration of that great year and the 150th since the Red Sox clinched a World Series victory in 1985.  The Red Sox are the American League's number one franchise, making a deep run to the World Series and reaching the playoffs, but the success of that franchise has been largely driven by the fact that the franchise has won a staggering amount of Baseball's greatest trophies and the greatest records. They have done the same thing, and that is, they have achieved the franchise's most notable victory: the first World Series series of the modern era.  As the season is winding down, you would be hard-pressed to find an

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, today I would like to honor the 100th birthday of Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a man who would make history not with a silver spoon but with a gold ring on his finger.  On October 10, 1931, Lincoln Diaz-Balart was born to a family of immigrants. At the age of 16, he had spent his childhood in New York City as a housekeeper and teacher. His early life was spent in Brooklyn.  But his family and friends believed in a rich tradition of Mexican food: beans, pork and chicken and eggs in a vat of water. And so he made the famous Mexican food and his family rich in what they called the ``chunk food of the heart.''  He was a proud immigrant from the great State of Arizona and came from the U.S. border. He brought his food to the city, and when he had a job, he made sure he got the food that was sold. His food was an example of American values and values that were built on a family. He knew that if you worked hard, you could get the family you wanted and the food you liked.  But after he became a resident in the State of South Dakota, he felt compelled to flee for
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to express my appreciation to the University of Tennessee Alumna College of Law and the University of California, Berkeley, for all of its hard work on this issue.  Throughout his career, the jurist has dedicated himself to improving the legal landscape, and this year marks the 70th anniversary of his appointment.  Throughout his career, he has led the university through rigorous academic programs and dedicated to preparing young men and women to the profession of law. On the way to graduate, the university was able to create a strong and motivated university culture through its legal education system and its faculty.  I extend my sincere appreciation to the University of Tennessee for all of its hard work and efforts to improve the legal landscape. I want to thank Judge William C. ``Bill'' Brown for his support and friendship on this issue, and I extend my thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Judge Paul ``Paul'' A. ``Paul'' Brown, for his commitment to teaching and learning, and for his incredible work on behalf of law students, faculty, and alumni.  For 70 years, the University of Tennessee has served the citizens of the United States for the better part of our history and in many ways its future
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, last December, there were nearly 70,000 cases of cancer involving the lungs of children. In the last 5 years, the number of children with lung cancer has gone from 2,100 to 15,000.  When we talk about the importance of taking care of our children, what we are talking about is the impact that this legislation will have.  There are over 30,000 Americans with lung cancer who are being treated at our hospitals. When we talk about the impact that the bill will have on those families, what we are talking about is the impact on the health care providers who will be taking care of their patients.  I thank my colleague, Mr. Shimkus, for allowing us to bring this to our attention. This bill will help, instead of delaying a critical funding issue, let us focus on the important work of the Department of Health and Human Services. This legislation, Madam Speaker, will help bring that focus to the health care providers. 
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the work of our colleagues on the House Committee on Financial Services and their bipartisan work on a bill that will provide relief to all Americans when it comes to job loss. That is a long way from saying: The House Committee is working on a bill that will address this challenge and make real economic progress for all Americans and ensure that we have that relief we deserve.  However, I would remind my colleagues that my friends on the other side of the aisle, which are also here today, oppose this legislation and continue to insist on its needlessly burdensome financial reporting requirements.  This bill is nothing more than a procedural procedural matter. We are here to vote on this bill, and it is something that, at least from the committee, the House has worked on. We had some tough votes yesterday, and it has been up for the better part of 2 months. But it doesn't matter because we know this legislation will help millions of Americans find work in the private sector. It is not just jobs. This legislation will also help small businesses and all Americans. It will also help our small businesses. It will make our economy better and save jobs.  Now, I know this is a procedural exercise that we

The text of the amendment is as follows: At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the      following:       Sec. __.  None of the funds provided in this Act may be      used to implement any provision of the Social Security      Improvement Act (15 U.S.C. 401 et seq.). The Acting CHAIR.

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairman Royce for his hard work and commitment to protecting our water infrastructure and drinking water.  Mr. Royce's bill is simple and straightforward. It is one of two bills introduced by my colleague from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) that have the support of Mr. Foxx, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a former member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as my former colleague, Congressman Price, for years.  They have bipartisan support in this House, and I appreciate the work they do on this side of the aisle.  Mr. Royce's bill provides for $4.1 billion to go to the States to fight for their water needs. In addition, it creates new grants for infrastructure projects. And it makes improvements to our sewer systems, to water systems for the environment.  And it protects our groundwater. The water infrastructure in this country has been severely damaged, and there are thousands of wells at risk. But it continues to be safe. The bill, it goes, provides $1.5 billion for groundwater maintenance and a $1.5 billion to support our drinking water system.  Mr. Royce's bill is a win for
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from Colorado, Ms. Lowey, for yielding. I also want to congratulate him on his service and accomplishments.  Mr. Speaker, this week marks a significant day for my community in Arkansas and across the country, and I congratulate the members of the National Guard and the Army as they begin combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.  With the passage of this important legislation, the Guard is making a significant contribution to our military by providing them with the equipment and training that they need in order to maintain the operational and security base in their communities.  A large part of this Guard's funding comes from the National Guard Education Fund, the NGT Education Fund, and the National Guard Education Council, which serves the military and military families and retirees in Arkansas. These programs provide them with a foundation in their communities that supports the training, the equipment, and the supplies they need to maintain the missions that they want to perform.  In addition to the Guard and the Army, the National Guard and the National Guard Education Fund are also providing a large portion of their funding to the National Guard for additional military training that they need to serve their communities.  With that, I thank the members of the Guard
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the President-elect's proposal to defund Planned Parenthood.  I wish to thank the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and their staff for working so hard and so diligently. I also wish to thank the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for their leadership and support.  This legislation is a strong statement on a real issue. The Supreme Court case before us today will have broad implications for women's health and the economy.  I can't imagine what it is like for women to ask for government action without any real knowledge of it. Planned Parenthood is the organization whose funds are being used to expand Planned Parenthood clinics, which is where millions of women would be forced to rely upon.  In the last few months, this organization has been threatened by lawsuits, by the Trump administration, and even by the Trump administration itself. This bill would have put the power of the government in lawless and unconstitutional ways.  The President has already spent taxpayer dollars to expand Planned Parenthood clinics in California. We will fight for women's health rights, and the President's bill will help keep it a secret.  It has been a long time since we have considered a bill like this;

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, as the majority leader has said, the Senate will do its best to work out what the new law means for the economy in the coming year.  This is not a partisan issue; it is a fact. When the Senate begins considering a budget, the only thing that can get the majority leader involved in negotiations is to have that deal. For the sake of this economy, I believe that the Senate should be able to do so, and that will be the way to do it, but we have not been able to do it. We have not been able to do that because we haven't made it in the past.  The President has said he wants to have a balanced budget amendment and he has been willing to do that. Now, there are serious questions about the timing of the debate. The President has said we are about to have a full discussion about a budget; that is, an amendment that the Senate has adopted; that is, the President wants to say that we are going to do our best to balance the budget. That is not what has worked out in the past.  The President has said the budget will not come back until December 30. It seems to me that the President is asking the Senate to vote on

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise to support the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  I have heard a lot over the past few days about Judge Gorsuch being a giant among men of all political stripes, but I do know that his nomination to the Supreme Court is an historic one. We will all know it when it is announced and it is confirmed by a vote.  As many of my colleagues know, at the end of last year, I called on Judge Gorsuch and asked him to be confirmed by voice vote, and he did. We all listened, I suppose. In the past few weeks, we heard from dozens of individuals who have raised concerns that, if confirmed by voice vote, Judge Gorsuch would be an irreplaceable Federal district judge, and that is one of them. I can't imagine an individual like Judge Gorsuch who has held this position for the last 20 years that the Supreme Court would be an historic one.  Now I am proud of the work that has been done to confirm Judge Gorsuch's confirmation. He is being nominated to the Federal Court. The Senate is on the precipice of a change in the precedent of the highest Court in America. I think the Senators who are trying to take hold of Judge Gorsuch,

Mr. President, last month I was privileged to receive an inaugural address at the University of Illinois, giving me a chance to thank so many people who have dedicated their careers to our country and to our Nation. I am humbled to represent this university well.  As we speak today, this past weekend, students from my State and the University of Illinois have celebrated their 90th anniversary. They have done more than any other university in the world to help bring us closer together. This University of Illinois is the home to the best high school football team in the Nation, and the University of Illinois offers an opportunity to recognize and appreciate the talent and dedication of its students.  I wish to take a few moments to talk about the University of Illinois and what it is like to be part of that history and the people we love.  I am pleased, for me, that the University of Illinois has been an innovator in higher education. In fact, the University of Illinois has built upon what was just a 15-year program in law school to get young women who want to succeed and succeed and to improve their lives in college to become lawyers, to become lawyers, and to enter into the private practice of law. In fact, in my own undergraduate
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the ongoing and continued crisis in our country's airways, the continuing crisis at home and at work, the continuing crisis at home and at home's failure in the middle of all the recent tragedies, the continuing crisis at the local and national levels.  Let me be clear. We are not a small country. We are a government. We are the largest country in the world, with one-third of the world's air space, and we are home. What we have here today is a massive national crisis that cannot be contained.  I am glad to work with the chairman of the Committee on House and Senate Governments in the Federal Government to make sure we never forget the importance of providing air, water, and sanitation to a country whose airway system is in trouble. We are in the midst of a disaster that will devastate thousands of miles of coastlines and destroy thousands of lives.  I am very proud of what the chairman and Chairman Dingell have done and the chairman and the entire committee leadership have done, especially in this difficult time. We are not going to take the time to do that.  My constituents have suffered. Their families have suffered. Our community is experiencing a terrible

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to thank my colleague, Mr. Waxman, for joining me this morning to discuss my bill H.R. 1273.  The Department of Energy is the only agency that currently has jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act. As the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am a champion for the rule of law. I also represent this important issue because it has long been an issue in this Chamber, but we have all heard of the oil and gas industries, and we know how much their energy needs are. They are not just a job creator or a producer of energy, they produce the resources, whether you call it energy independence, or it's oil and gas, or natural resources, or oil and gas, or oil and natural gas.  In fact, one of the most interesting aspects of this bill is how this provision affects energy production. The provision in this bill ensures that this provision does not require more fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. That's not a dirty trick. It's not a dirty job. It's a job creator that creates jobs. It creates jobs, and that's something this bill will do.  I agree with the chairman of the Energy and Natural
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember the life and service of Dr. Michael J. Smith from Fort Worth, Texas, who passed away on May 25.  Dr. Smith was an exemplary and respected educator who was known for his devotion to the education and service of the Fort Worth community. He also was an outstanding leader who led the community in educating its students to better serve the Texas and North Texas communities.  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Smith began his education at the Fort Worth School District in 1943, the last year he had left for a teaching career. He graduated with honors in 1973 with degrees in psychology, applied science, and history. In 1974 he received his master's degree from the University of Texas at Dallas.  Dr. Smith's lifelong commitment to education and service earned him numerous awards and accolades. Among the most notable, including the University of Dallas, were an outstanding student council president, faculty director, and student council vice president. He became a member of the Dallas school board, which he later served on, and is the vice president of the School of Education and Leadership, which is the school of leadership for the Fort Worth community.  In addition to his outstanding achievements, Dr. Smith's service on
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the 100th birthday of the Greatest Generation.  From early childhood, to the birth of the United States Air Force, the Greatest Generation was the embodiment of the values of bipartisanship, sacrifice, and patriotism. But in the aftermath of World War II, when the Cold War erupted, the United States Air Force and its allies fought and defeated the Axis powers. The Greatest Generation emerged from that conflict as a testament to the resilience of the United States' air forces and, in particular, our Air Force.  It has been said that since World War II, the Air Force has been the only military force in the world that has achieved success in the fight for freedom and democracy. The Air Force and the United States Air Force are two great examples of the extraordinary strength of the Greatest Generation and of the many courageous men and women who made a significant contribution to the fight for our freedom.  This remarkable group of men and women represents a true example of a man who did not only write the Constitution but wrote his own history and lived to be 100 years old. And I wish I could say that it was a man from the great State of Texas, but, unfortunately, that wasn
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the Protecting Americans from Unfair Trade Practices Act. I want to thank Chairman Towns, my colleague and chairman of the full committee, for bringing this measure before us today.  H.R. 3 will help ensure that the U.S. automotive industry's competitive advantage is well-defined. As we close the achievement gap on the auto industry's track record of increasing competition, there will be opportunities for the American automotive industry to stay competitive and win.  For the past 17 years, automakers have been able to offer highly competitive products and service to our markets, so we can create jobs for Americans at a lower cost and keep our industries competitive.  Now is not the time to reward companies for success. Instead, we should take this important investment and do the same in the future. This bill will help American manufacturers and job creators keep our industries competitive by strengthening the U.S. manufacturing sector and reducing the national debt.  The U.S. auto industry plays a very important role in global markets, and auto dealers are a crucial player in every segment of the American
