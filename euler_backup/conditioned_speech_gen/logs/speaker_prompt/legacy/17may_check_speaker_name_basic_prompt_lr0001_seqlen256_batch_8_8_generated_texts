Mitch McConnell (D-Calif.) will likely join the Republican National Committee on Wednesday morning for a press conference at the Office of Legal Counsel in New York City, with members expected to arrive in the State House after the conference.

The Senate Republicans are looking to bring the session to a close over the weekend, and may have a chance to consider a bipartisan deal that Democrats have been pushing for in recent weeks.

Here are just some of the things that have been discussed during the press conference on Capitol Hill.

1. McConnell will likely participate in a press conference at the Office of Legal Counsel in New York City.

The Senate on Wednesday morning will try to hold a press conference at the Office of Legal Counsel in New York City and then meet with McConnell at the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department. The meeting is likely set to begin at 1:00 p.m. ET, plus 10:00 p.m. PT on Capitol Hill.

2. The Republican-led House of Representatives will formally begin preparing for the Judiciary Conference.

As previously reported by The Washington Post, House leaders are trying to reach a compromise on the upcoming Senate Judiciary Committee. The Republican-led House of Representatives is considering the idea of splitting
Harry Reid, who has been a vocal proponent of the Senate’s proposed rule that would gut the existing Senate filibuster, said the Senate majority decision by a majority of the Court had done “good work”.

“We have ruled that the Senate will not go into the race until all Senate leaders have had an opportunity to see the Senate floor for their votes, and that is also a great way they can do that now, and I am not sure where our position is going to come from,” Reid said.

“The Senate’s ruling was a great achievement, and the Senate is currently trying to push this case all the way back to the Supreme Court.”

The Senate majority also has already found that the Senate is not on its way to the Supreme Court for an expansion of the filibuster, which the Senate voted to dismiss last month.

The Senate’s latest motion, which will likely take effect in the fall, said the Senate would be given “only the time,” after the Judiciary Committee and the Judiciary Committee’s majority. The motion, if passed, would effectively be a vote by the Senate against the motion.

“The Senate will find that
John Cornyn (spokesman for the UK’s National Health Service) in the White House on Friday said the “cute” way that the NHS is using its “public” network of doctors and hospitals to help people with respiratory problems, including children, was “pathetic”.

“It’s just wonderful to see that they’re using public resources when they really need them,” said Dr Cornyn.

“It’s great to see that a health care organisation like the NHS is using their public resources to help people with respiratory symptoms, because they’re getting the best at these things.

“It’s just wonderful to see that they’re using public resources when they really need them and also in the NHS. It’s just so satisfying to see them using the public money whenever they need it while they get their health care money.

“But, there’s a whole difference between public health care and public health services, and they don’t have to pay for the services themselves. With the public resources in the NHS and people are coming in and using them – they don’t
Richard Durbin-Hicks: Not only do most of us have a lot of knowledge about the science of climate change, but we also have a good understanding of how the weather changes. And so in this talk, we’re going to talk about how we can use data to make better decisions about climate change.

Durbin-Hicks: And you talked a little earlier about how we can use the data to make better decisions about climate change.

Hicks: What do you mean by the data?

Durbin-Hicks: Well, you start with the research that we have been doing on climate data, and we are studying more and more different data types around the world, so we want to do a better analysis so that we can make the right conclusions because the data in different types of data have different patterns in the pattern of change, which is what we can use to make better decisions.

Hicks: And there are a number of things you can do to try and find the best data that you can go with, like how we used to classify data.

Neil Abercrombie in his New York Times best-selling “Troubled Little by the Devil” book has the perfect blend of comedy and tragedy to create an even more powerful movie.

“Troubled Little by the Devil” is one of those gems that should be seen in cinema: it’s a play with the wicked play of characters, written by an old, old-school comic writer, John Stossel. The book, which debuted at Cannes later that year with a sequel directed by John Stossel and starring a cast that includes John D. and Tony Shalabian, is based on author and comic critic Roger Moore’s 2002 novel of the same name. Stossel’s novel is one of two screenplays that Moore and other writers wrote for and which Stossel, of whom this is the most popular, came up with to draw the character of the “unemployed” Tom Stossel during his short fiction debut.

While the film was a success, Stossel and the Stossel Brothers — who also wrote for Moore’s previous novel, “Troubled Little by the Devil,” — never found their own version of

Donald Trump is under fire for his criticism of his fellow Republicans in the House.

Trump’s new foreign policy and a nationalistic foreign policy are not the same thing and he has his own differences of opinion. Trump is a former Republican Party candidate who ran as a counter to the establishment as a moderate. He started his political career from 2009 and started running as a Republican in 2010. Trump believes in America’s founding principles but he has a history of using his position as a counter to the establishment he enjoys.

Trump has his own views on foreign policy. He is very pro-American but he disagrees with a lot of things Trump has said. A very conservative president doesn’t want to be a presidential or senator president and instead he views it as an acceptable form of personal responsibility. Trump’s views don’t support him and he has never criticized the Republican Party for not supporting him. He is a very conservative Republican and his views may be influenced by the opinions of his opponents.

It’s easy to forget that Donald Trump is a major supporter
Harry Reid was known to be an enthusiastic supporter of the Bush administration’s effort to end the Iran-Contra scandal, and was also known to have called for the release of the White House’s personal phone records. He said:

“It’s not just the phone number, but the entire record, not just the recording, all of the phone conversations.”

Obama and his supporters have accused him of trying to keep America from ending the Iran-Contra affair.

But Reid’s campaign has said he is more interested in how the president’s administration responds to criticism of his handling of the Iran scandal.

He said:

“Mr. Reid had been trying to keep the U.S. world on track to stop the Iran-Contra scandal, and he was really the one, the one, at the core of America’s campaign, to get to the bottom of this stuff.”

Obama also made it clear that Reid’s public comments weren’t taking him outside the “déjà vu”.

Born in London, Cornyn is the son of a well-known local politician and musician, and he was educated at the London Academy of Music and Drama and was a pupil to the renowned English musician and songwriter William Shakespeare's works. He later taught English and performed in the London Stock market.

Cornyn was appointed as London's youngest drummer at the age of 21 at his first appearance. It was he who introduced him to David Crosby's band and to Sir Charles Taylor's cello: he played the piano throughout the first concert in London while he was still a young man. For many years it was the man's choice to play a string section on guitar as a siderview and as a keyboard. He was then encouraged to be a stagehand and a bass player; he also became a pianist. As a musician, the man made his first major breakthrough, in the creation of a

They’re two things he didn’t take, as well as the fact that he was always going to go to movies that were really bad for him, so I think that’s a good thing.

Steve Riddell: Oh, I love that! Well, that’s a lot of money for the guy that I worked for, but this is basically the last two, three hours. I had already left a bunch of my stuff on the couch when I was doing the first two hours. I was going out for hours, and I couldn’t get the best time until I was back.

A man is a person who has died or passed away. The most important of the dead are those who have lost their bodies and survived or gone on to the battlefield, and those who have not. These persons are also generally known as Ahabs.

The term Ahab or "Bait" means the body of the dead.

We will look at the structures of the proteins that are in this molecular machinery, and how the structures are altered when they are altered. It will also reveal, from what we know about a particular piece of DNA, how mutations can occur in proteins that are in this particular structural environment, and in a couple of other, yet equally yet less-extinct, organisms. It will also reveal the biochemical relationships that contribute to the formation of structures that have a structural similarity to structures observed in nature. It will also reveal the mechanisms in which mutations occur, and how they affect structure building.

Mitch McConnell, Senator and senior Democrat. In this week of the Congressional Budget Office, the Democrats introduced a bipartisan bill that proposes a bipartisan bill that would create an orderly process for eliminating spending caps that are introduced each year over the next 10 years. The bill would amend the appropriations bill of the budget of the Federal government, and allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to take charge of $1.8 billion of emergency spending appropriations. During the Senate Finance Committee, the bipartisan bill allows the Treasury Departments to take the oversight of spending cap on the agency to $1.6 billion. In addition, the bill also provides appropriations committees with access to $300 billion in infrastructure spending funds from the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Divisions. The bill also requires the House Appropriations Committee to meet on Tuesday, July 18, 2009. At the request of the House Appropriations Committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee is now authorized to meet on Monday, May 29, 2009.

The Senate intelligence committee would then provide the memos to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee. The Senate would then consider them to provide to the Senate Judiciary Committee the congressional briefing of the memos, reports, and findings, the administration said.

Mitch McConnell said a bipartisan bill on climate goals that will ensure our economy is resilient, secure. That's a deal that would strengthen protections for the American family across the spectrum. But Congress is not in session to approve this bill. As the President says, our economy is fragile without America. Even if Congress votes it as strongly in support of this bill, it could send the message that we want a sustainable, inclusive economy. It could give Congress a chance to pass a bipartisan plan to address the challenges facing America. It could also offer some concessions. In a bipartisan agreement this week, the Senate is expected to pass a climate goals package to address climate change this summer. But in the Senate, the bipartisan bipartisan bill is pending. This bill would require the Trump administration to lift the greenhouse gas bill until it is in compliance with the Paris Agreement on climate change. That would provide an additional $1 billion to the American economy, a $700 billion cut to wages, and an additional $2 billion to the federal deficit.

I am honored that the Chair of the National Assembly, Congressman Mark Meadows, has proposed amendments to the United Nations General Assembly's rules to ensure that countries in every country with a minimum living wage have access to fair wages, even for women. These rules create a permanent employer mandate. The DCE recognizes that this mandate is important, and I support the legislation. The DCE has approved legislation establishing the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and supports legislation that requires the United Nations to ensure that people in every country with a minimum wage are able to find employment in the United States. I would ask that the provisions of the UNDP's rules, which provide the opportunity to employers to make sure their workers have the opportunity to bring their dreams to fruition, be included among the requirements for fairness.

Travis Childers, the Republican House minority leader, has been criticized for failing to give the Republicans an opportunity to confront the problem of a massive health care bill. But that bill passed just one year ago, it had nearly 100 votes, and even if not needed, the House subcommittee that considered it a priority when he announced his budget, known as the health reform bill, would not need its own committee.

But the chairman of the House subcommittee, who was asked just before he took over from the Republican leader, is not just another member of the House - he is the chief executive of the Department of Health, Education, and Human Services and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He's a member of the Senate health care bill, and he is the chief executive of the Department of Workforce and Housing. He served as a subcommittee chairman from 2006 to 2009, and last time was again in 2012 when he was the chief executive of the Department of Labor, later reauthorized his own reform bill. That bill, known as the health care reform bill, would have allowed the health care system to be reformed by any one of its 12 committees - the House and Senate committees. In those committees, the Senate and House chambers would have had a three-year period

Mitch McConnell: This was the third weekend in a row that the House had discussed legislation to prevent the EPA from using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Environmental Systems Design database for its national energy production program, or PESA, or the Environmental Protection Agency. The House on Thursday passed S. 113, the legislation that prohibits all data from the National Energy Information Service from being used by the EPA. They did so after Congress approved a $85 billion bill that would have taken to years to comply with the EPA’s program, which was to control the data and process it. But the legislation has gone back and forth on the issue in an effort to protect the environment, although there was concern the data could lead to carbon dioxide emissions the EPA is not required to control. Instead, it is likely that the EPA would be required to comply. The bill would prohibit the EPA from using any data from the National Energy Information Service at a time when Congress is considering legislation to prevent the EPA from doing its job. That has been controversial on some level. A bill proposed that would prevent the EPA from directly monitoring the data that has the biggest impact on the United States and that has the potential for emissions from its own resources. The bill allows agency staff

Joseph Heck, in a speech on the House floor, saying, "I am thrilled that the chairman and ranking member of the Republican caucus has committed to support a bill that would allow parents to ask children to send their young children to school for those who are mentally troubled or who may have substance abuse problems. I am particularly pleased that the Democratic caucus has unanimously agreed to support the bill. We have agreed to support the provision of the bill, but we have yet to make the determination that it is a child friendly bill, and we have yet to vote on it. When those conversations are finished, and they were scheduled for recess, it will take time for the House, where it is due to pass, to make the decision. And that time could have been sooner, or sooner, or sooner. But I understand the frustration from Republicans, and the frustration from Democrats, that the majority of us will not join in the Republican vote. But I also understand the frustration from Republicans, that the majority of us will not vote on the bill because there was not enough time to get it. And I know that from the very beginning, we have been working on the bill. And I understand that it does not have the same margin as the bill. There are many times when the bill

There is much talk on the importance of the future of the nuclear energy infrastructure. But there is no doubt that a majority of Americans support a vote to expand the nuclear energy infrastructure. The question is, what role does this play in the energy system today? The answer is, nuclear energy, the nuclear energy technology that power the rest of the world. The energy sector today has been heavily dependent on nuclear energy, including from the coal sector. And this is changing; not everyone agrees with the need for more sustainable nuclear energy, but most Americans are against it, and we ought to be ready for a long-term solution that benefits every one of us. This article looks at the potential role of nuclear energy in the current environment. I think this issue is important to a large portion of the American people and is, to many people, a political issue. Unfortunately, the debate on this issue has created an uproar in the Congress. That is why I call on the American people to ensure that the bill is passed and that the bill passes, and that this bill is never lost. I call upon the American people to consider strengthening the nuclear energy infrastructure that is currently being developed in this country. I call upon the American people to consider

Neil Abercrombie. The question about the current condition of the US Constitution does not concern the constitutional question whether the Senate would have the powers to pass the amendment. One cannot trust the constitutionality of the act that the amendment was created to read in the House of Representatives. In fact, the amendment was specifically authorized by the Senate. This amendment was considered to be reasonable. It had the opposite impact on the Constitution. Now, the amendment was in direct opposition to the constitutionality of the act, and we have to confront this problem, the amendment had to be read in the Senate. This is because the Congress must have the powers to pass it. The amendment was passed, however, not on the floor, but on the floor only, and the amendment was not read in the Senate. In fact, it was passed on the floor, in the Senate, only to the Speaker. It was not read on the floor, in the House.

Travis Childers. It is the story of what happened to my brother in the midst of a battle before the United States Army. He was taken in an attack by two infantrymen of his own, a German battalion of the United States Army. As the men left the field of battle, they were confronted by a terrible fate. It was the darkest time for thousands of American people. The fate of the United States would be the closest to that of the world. There was a terrible loss of one of our major weapons, a machine-gun. It was a major defeat, and the Americans of the Third World took back their former glory. One American was killed, and one of our men died. Two were injured. The Americans suffered a total loss in three weeks. The Americans had the biggest casualties in the history of the war. The worst was that I had died of the cowardice of our fellow countrymen. I had to kill the country and the United States. I had the chance to do so. I could talk.

Since the CASI is being used under torture, as the USA has done it in the past, the country has been trying to force the U.N. Security Council to pass the treaty that it is opposed to.  While the U.N. Security Council supports the treaty, its members, particularly in the American administration, have been reluctant to vote on it.  The two nations have agreed that if the treaty does pass, it requires the United States State Department to send the required 30,000 prisoners and a prisoner of conscience to a commission to investigate the torture.  The process must be approved before the commission can be commissioned to investigate the alleged torture of children in the United State.  The purpose of the torture, or even the torturer's innocence, is to prevent torture, and also to make sure the victims know their responsibility.  If a group of

The author is one of the very few people on the committee that are interested. It is difficult to figure out why. They are not afraid to do the same. Many of whom are not afraid are concerned by the fact that it is easier for people to vote than to do the same. They are concerned about the fact that, because no one in the committee is afraid that they are voting on this motion, they are going to do their best to vote on that motion. And no one has ever done that. So I ask the committee to support the amendment. I ask the committee to vote to do the same. They have to do it the same way I have done in the past.

That should be a very, very important thing, and that was the last thing I heard from them.

Richard Durbin. It will be the third time now the U.S. has been on the move since its first trip to the World Trade Center.  Mr. President, I have always been very proud of our effort to bring the World Trade Center to safety along with the State of Maryland to be the first to be hit with the deadliest virus ever.  Yet the State of Maryland has been hit from all sides with this massive damage. That's why I have been so proud of the work that has gone into fixing the damage and the damage, and the work that has gone into fixing the structure that caused the flooding.  The damage from the flood has been devastating for America.  This has been a good thing from the beginning, and the work has been done.  Today I want to thank the gentleman from Texas, Senator Tom Lewis, for agreeing to visit the damaged site.  Mr. Lewis.  So thank you.  Mr. President.  The United States has a total of 12 days of on-line access for Americans to get access to the World Trade Center.  From our point of view, this is a very important issue.  The United States is at the center of our military-industrial complex.  They have been around for
Neil Abercrombie. The U.S. Department of State has a plan to increase the number of health care benefits for seniors. It now brings in $12 billion to health care assistance for seniors.  The President's plan is to extend the Medicare/PSTS program from 8 to 16 months in 2018; extend the health care funding to a period of 14 months from the date of enactment of the legislation, which expires on December 1, 2019; and extend the Medicaid program from 5 to 8 years. During this period, the U.S. Department of Health Care Services will support Medicare 2 million seniors.  The Department of Health Care Services will support Medicare 3 million seniors. The Department of Health Care Services will support Medicare 2 million seniors; the Department of Health Care Services will support Medicare 4 million seniors. The Department of Justice is preparing a plan with the provision for expanded Medicaid reimbursements under the Affordable Care Act, the CBOE-GSSA program, and the Medicare Direct Payment Program to address the issues here under the Affordable Care Act.  The Department of Justice planned to expand Medicaid.  The Department of Justice's plan requires the health care services of over 1.8 million seniors. The Department of Justice is preparing Medicare for Medicare 2.9 million
Travis Childers. I have to ask, what is the new Federal law addressing this matter?  Mr. Speaker, I hear the majority of the time in California and I don't know the meaning or the language of it.  One of the reasons that I want to respond to that is that I recognize, what we are doing in this case is something that is not in line with the general principle of judicial confirmation.  This rule is very in line with rules of the Federal Judiciary.  The Federal district courts have in most cases said it is wrong to order the prosecution of an accused for contempt. That is true, and I think that's true, obviously the right thing to do, but it is wrong. I mean, they can't order me to do that. We have to order me to be convicted. So that's the point.

In 1986, I was selected to chair the Committee on Energy and Public Works.  
Gokberk Ozsoy.  My thoughts on the matter of how big our country is, and what I call the Nation's Law, may be, if it does not comply with the Constitution, and if it does not comply with our laws, it will be treated with the same fairness and justice of Congress that it would be treated as if we were the United States.  Our constitution guarantees the rule of law.  Our laws allow the States to control their rules of trade, commerce, and sovereignty; they provide the rule of their own people; they authorize the Federal Government to regulate their commerce; they ensure the rule of law; and they are the rule of the people.  The Constitution is a rule of the People; we are the chief judge in the States, the court sitting in every State; we are the executive.  Our Nation is governed by Congress, and the Judiciary, Congress, and the judiciary act the Constitution, the rule of the people.  We have done every good Thing that it has done that we have done, and we have found it. It has done more to serve the people than to protect them.  The Constitution is the best system of government in the world. Without it, we will have no rule of law,

I want to go back to work and finish my work, and I don't know what can I do. All my work has been done, I have been doing that. This is what I want to do, I think it is what it needs to be considered with all of the other work that we, the other Senators have done in the Senate.  It is what it needs to be considered with all of the other work that we, the other Senators have done in the Senate because it will give us the opportunity to work together over time.

I want them to know that they have a legitimate claim to what they are fighting for with guns, and I want them to realize that we are not going to fight terrorism or any other terrorist organization unless and until they have the support of the people. We are not going to attack someone because we are not going to attack them or because we are not going to attack those children and the elderly and those people that come here, but we are going to destroy them to the point of no return, and we are going to go in on terrorists who are trying to terrorize you, and what they say is that they

My goal in this project is to make sure that as much of our lives as we may enjoy that one small thing we do, that is, that we spend more time in a little place where it is more like a little corner of the continent.

But we will be able to take care of our own. It is our responsibility to keep the time that is a little bit of the same between us until we are able to do all of that.

Mr. President, I rise in support of this motion, in whole or in part, to move forward with the motion on all issues relating to the bill, pursuant to the provisions contained in section 517 of the Senate bill. It was agreed that the Clerk of the House of Representatives vote the bill the appropriate way. The bill, as previously stated, did not include a comprehensive amendment to the current amendment, but it did include a resolution to clarify the title of the bill.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Ms. Speaker, I ask to be made aware that President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that the U.S. will do everything it can to stop ISIS from reaching Europe.  Now, there is no doubt that ISIS, which has been successful in crossing Europe and even more successful than Iraq, is still a threat to the international security of the United States.  In this respect ISIS is a terrorist organization and the United States is not safe from it. ISIS has been defeated in Europe and in Asia, and it has been defeated in Europe and in Asia in the last month alone. ISIS has been defeated in Europe, but it is not defeated in Asia. Moreover, ISIS is not attacking the United States, which aspires to destroy the United States as the economic security of the United States. We have been in contact with ISIS for nearly 40 years, and we know that they have done their job in a successful manner. They have always been successful. They have always been able to defend themselves and to create a safe and secure area for them to be in, which is the case with ISIS, in the United States. They are very strategic thinkers that have a strong understanding of the challenge this country faces and they realize that we have

Neil Abercrombie (1887-1960). Mr. Speaker, I am glad that today's Democratic majority will not simply pass its time on the legislation.  It is as much about health care, and the bill as it is about the bill.  I also want to acknowledge the fact that Mr. Speaker, we have seen that the health care bill has become quite the phenomenon. The healthcare bill we have in the House we have been talking about has become one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been on the table under our very noses.  So I can tell you about the Health Care Reform Act of 2009, the health care reform bill of 2009.  Mr. Speaker, I do intend to highlight the important reforms that this bill has brought.  The health care reform bill that you have just been talking about is the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance reform bill, the H.D. 1201 program that was introduced in Congress in January 2009, the H.D. 1321 program that is a great step forward for the health care reform effort.  It's the bill that we had just received in the Senate, we have had some great work done in that process.  During the last week, we've had a tremendous work done
Travis Childers.  This is the 2nd in a series of articles and discussions about the topic of the first anniversary of the massacre of 13 people in a church and the first time the church has taken a stand.   The message of the First Anniversary (or First Anniversary, if you like) is that the anniversary of the massacre did not begin as a celebration of human suffering, but rather a celebration of God's glory.   God created this world, and his glory is the greatest gift of ever produced, and it has been blessed by God and His glory.   God created all things in Jesus Christ, including humans, and the church grew up around him.   He raised up the body of Christ, the Lamb, and the Spirit, to serve humanity, and to bring to them His glory and eternal life.   God loved and blessed people, including those who live now.   God made all men of good will and good works. Yet, through his grace and power, all of us today will be saved.    With this 1,000th anniversary of the massacre, and all over this country, the great majority of Americans may be pleased with the new day we see the American people again and again, but those
Joseph Heck.  The Senate has been divided on spending and the economy.  Mr. Speaker, a $70 billion budget request, which has been approved by the Senate, would have to include a $10 billion spending hole under an existing agreement with the Treasury, which would have to be signed before the fiscal stimulus bill that is being prepared for that funding request can be delivered.  In my view, a proposal that includes a spending hole will still affect the majority party budget. The majority budget is an attempt to maintain the fiscal stimulus deficit and to increase the fiscal stimulus budget over and above their funding deficit, or to create opportunities for the majority to balance the budget. What follows are the components of the spending hole, in particular the fiscal stimulus bill that is being prepared for the fiscal stimulus stimulus; the spending hole in the Senate; and the appropriations bill (which the Senators have agreed on) that is being negotiated for the fiscal stimulus bill (which was prepared and negotiated at the request of the Senate; which was negotiated for the Senate). The Republicans have indicated that they are willing to have another $10 billion cut in the deficit for the fiscal stimulus bill. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that this amount of spending cuts in the Senate is a stretch on the deficit and,

There is no such question as the truth.  That question needs to be answered by a better, more objective, and better alternative.  The question is not whether that is true or false; the question is just a question to find out what the truth is.  If you cannot answer this question, then what is the right question? The truth is not the answer to the question. The truth is that the answer is a simple yes.  The truth is not the answer to the question.  The truth, though not just a simple yes, is that all that is said about the truth that it is there in the body is that there is no such question as the truth.  It is the correct thing to answer.  The truth is, the body is correct as a whole, and its body is a complete and complete piece of equipment to make it to the world.

John Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, when I was to be there and during the course of this session, I had the following remarks from the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority leader of the Democratic Party, I believe was born out of the Republican party and I think that it was the Republican wing, which I really wanted to put out there. Because this was a Democratic tradition, I think, on which many of the parties in America have had their success, they have been so far ahead in many ways, in terms of the health care bill and in terms of what many of the Democratic Party's leaders have been doing, that it was a very good thing that they had a leader who was willing to play his part, one of the Democratic leaders in the Senate.  Well, Mr. Speaker, I certainly hope we are to be as successful as the Democratic Party leaders. In terms of leadership, our leadership has been a lot, and there has, to me, been very positive developments.  Today, I am to be very proud to be a leader in this party.  I am proud to be the leader.  I look forward to the Republican leadership, the
Richard Durbin, a professor of government at the University of Pennsylvania. The first question we are concerned is whether President Bush offered an alternative to Obama's stimulus package. Bush's stimulus plans are a reasonable compromise, but don't get us anywhere. The question is does the President provide the money needed to help with the stimulus? What about what they actually cost? Do they come from the private sector? Is it for a package or is it for a package with a larger budget at the end of the year? I will answer because I think the answer to this question is yes. And if the President does offer money to boost the stimulus, it'll be a massive investment in the stimulus-related economic stimulus project. It will send new, transformative economic news to our economy and send news over the horizon that is very critical in our economic recovery.  The President should try to offer the stimulus package, I think, to the right size. The answer to this question will be no. As long as it's a comprehensive package, it's just as good as what's at the end of the year.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I welcome the Members who have joined us today and ask the American people, Mr. Speaker, to pay attention to what they know.

I don't know how you could ask such a gentleman to make that request, but I do remember, at one time, that when I was in Germany, when I was teaching at the University of Basel, the gentleman from Basel was from Poland, from Poland, from Poland, and from Poland, I remember him saying, with great humility, that if we make a decree, that we must have a better law, and he said that that was a terrible thing to do, he was not going to believe it; he understood exactly what the gentleman from Basel actually meant. So I think he agreed with me, and I think there were a lot of people in that class who came to see him, and I think they listened to him and made a mistake with regard to what he was saying. But I can't take away from that. I thought he was going to say, you know, I don't know that I have not seen or heard that much, and yes, I believe he is, I think, the gentleman from Basel

John Cornyn-Smith. A member of the Senate who has voted for the amendment.  Mr. Baucus, the ranking member.  You know, they did it on the floor.  You know, that's a terrible thing, which I have to point out. No one is going to do it. There are other people on the Senate side who have said that. My friend from Massachusetts and I have seen a lot of people go to the floor for this bill. This is a lot of people talking about it.  I mean, this bill is really a bipartisan bill.  I want to be able to pass the bill. It is a bipartisan issue.  So, I have no problem with the H.R. 1021 amendment, that I would like to pass.  I am opposed to that, but I guess I am opposed to the amendment. There were a lot of people who said that today because it was very, very controversial.  I think the amendment was very controversial.  It is actually the only amendment that would have that consideration.  So I think the amendment would have no consideration as to who the President should vote for.  I don't think that that is a good amendment.  The question on the amendment was how
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I yield the following question to Mr. Speaker. It concerns the effect on the country, particularly the South, of a proposed increase in appropriations for the Department of Energy. It would make immediate and transparent an impact on the country that many Republicans believe would never come to pass.  My bill would make it mandatory in the Senate, to be included in appropriations for the Department of Energy. That bill would prohibit all funding for or in addition to appropriations for the department of energy, including any funds for the Department of Energy.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. President, I rise to speak to colleagues who are concerned about the effects of the Affordable Care Act, and I wish you all the best in your efforts to help the American people.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chair, I am happy to report that in September, Mr. Reimer sent the following letter to the chair, on behalf of Mr. Reimer.  Mr. Reimer represents that Mr. Reimer and other committee chairs have been asked to respond to these requests to the chair on their behalf.  They have been and will continue to be very concerned about the direction in which my colleagues and I are putting their lives on.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Speaker, my colleague. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from Illinois. Mr. Speaker, we have a great week ahead of us with the administration and with our great budget.  I know that we still have a lot of bills to finish. Yet we are already working to complete a budget that doesn't seem to be done, because it is a really very good and bipartisan bill.  So that is a bipartisan bill.  We have a lot of work to complete that will take a number of years. We are starting to have some more work to do to finish an environmental package. I am talking about a budget that isn't done, and that is a budget that is not done because it is a bipartisan bill.  I have a couple of thoughts on the budget, which I say was an example of how I am going to work, and I am going to work to finish it later on the next budget.

Harry Reid.  Mr. President, I encourage all of the Members of Congress to use the time that they spend in their Members of Congress for the purpose of looking into the future of education and the future of the profession. The purpose of this effort has always been to help prevent a recession in the United States and to support the advancement of science, technology and innovation.  We cannot be seen as being a bad economy in any way. If we could see what a recession is looking like with the help of taxpayers, we would be a better place.

Mitch McConnell). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my colleagues be provided the opportunity to meet with me before I rise to speak about this legislation.  The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the bill is being considered as intended in a manner that will ensure a balanced and bipartisan vote. It is important that the Committee on Homeland Security is voting on this legislation in order to ensure that it is bipartisan, and that it is the proper body to vote on this legislation when it is being considered.  The bill is intended as a vote on the H. Res. 1550 amendment. If the Republican side wants to pass this bill before the Senate, it must pass both the House and the Senate on the motion on the bill before the Senator from Nebraska.  While we are talking about H. Res. 1550, I am not talking about other amendments like the Res. 1530 or the Res. 1535.  When a Senator talks about something like this right now today, there is no question of a balanced vote.  Once the majority has passed the bill, I will go to the Senate and ask the Members of Congress to agree with me that this legislation was right, and I will ask that they vote on the motion before the Senator from Nebraska.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all the committees, all Senate, and all commissions that meet at the Capitol and the Federal Building must be present. This legislation addresses a number of issues that concern the economy and jobs, including the tax legislation that we need to take forward as a result of this legislation that is being debated in the House, particularly in relation to climate change and the efforts to keep the U.S. economy growing and growing. We must also take forward the role that we must play in creating a healthy and efficient America.  The Committee on Energy also need to consider the many challenges we face, and the fact that the Federal Government relies on our private sector to support its economic growth. The Committee on Energy also need to have strong bipartisan support for the U.S. and its trade partners with the other major trading partners who are working with us on this legislation.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise in support of ObamaCare.  ObamaCare is a huge step. It is the number one health care cost increase in the United States. It is a big improvement on the last decade at the end of the Bush administration when America's health care system was in shambles and we faced a crisis of our own. And that is what, my friends, is going to be the difference between this and this other crisis of our own. We have never faced such a crisis.  We also have the largest amount of unemployment in the history of the United States, the largest number of people that have ever earned a living.  Mr. President, the CBO says that unemployment is going to rise. I have said I would support my colleagues and I do support my colleagues. I know it has been. It is a difficult time for middle class families to get affordable health care. It is a difficult time for small businesses to get these people living as well as making that quality of life to the American middle class. It is difficult.

John Cornyn (Macon), with the support of my colleagues from the West.  The Senator from California (Mr. Cornyn) is well pleased to announce the passage and immediate amendment making it the largest single amendment to a rule of the Senate. The rule will ensure that, by repealing the first amendment, we will also eliminate taxes on the sale of agricultural produce and other agricultural production activities. We also want to protect the public and ensure that the State of California maintains its own balance of payments.  The amendment is also a step toward protecting the right of the Federal Government to act as the chief executive of a State and an interstate commerce body; Federal aid is now the primary target of many of the State's fiscal years in the United States and abroad, and Congress is now authorized to regulate commerce. The legislation is necessary as we continue our fight for tax reform, because we are still debating the question of what the Federal Government should do in terms of implementing our trade policies.  We would like to focus on the fact that we are in the midst of a multiyear crisis. The Senate and the House have not yet agreed to the amendment, and the resolution was rejected.

This is very important to this legislation, because the economic downturn in this country has happened right where it started.  Now, I would like to go back to the floor of the House of Representatives and say to the gentleman from Utah, let me start by asking for his colleagues on the floor to be present. This is a time when the economy looks back fondly upon the good times we have had in this country. And this is not a good time to start with the Republican budget amendment that would make it harder to borrow. It is a time when we are dealing with the American economy. It is a time for us to recognize that we have created not just one of the worst economic crises in our Nation's history, but one of the best and most competitive economy in our Nation. I know we are going to continue to continue to do that, and I want to remind my colleagues that if we move forward in that direction, we will continue to

I am a veteran of the Energy Department's investigation of the potential financial ties between these companies that are being exposed as energy leasing, energy efficiency, and energy efficiency development programs. I was there with a colleague from California. He is a very good friend and a good listener. He said that this amendment to the floor should be the amendment that comes with the desk.

I rise to recognize the courageous work of Thomas William Johnson to help children learn from tragedy in America. I rise to speak during this week's annual American Heroes Day to honor the life, work, and honor of the son of an Irish-American immigrant who was just killed in his mother's home. We are all heroes, brothers and sisters, from every race and ethnic group. We are all men of faith. I urge the Congress to pass the bipartisan, bipartisan resolutions today aimed at preventing the use of military force by our military.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. It is time to be careful: What in the name of God would be permissible for some, as we stand here today speaking of this law of our own time, such as the right of the President to speak up about, the right to impose a price on a taxpayer for the use and enjoyment of the precious resources of the United States? The President is not the law of that time--he never was--what it is--the law of the United States--and the law of the people of the United States. That is what the President is about. A great problem that could be dealt with in the same manner as that and in the same way as the crisis in our system was dealt with in the crisis in our own time. And this is what I am arguing about, because the President is about the right to speak up about his own time and the right of the President to impose a price on a taxpayer for the use and enjoyment of the precious resources of the United States. I have said that the President, he has a right to impose a price on a taxpayer for the use and enjoyment of precious resources of the United States. I recognize the clause that is present--that is an integral part of the President's rule--

Mitch McConnell. Mr. Chair, this is a bipartisan effort to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and to rein in the health care law that is already having a catastrophic impact on our families. These bipartisan reforms are critical to the rule of law and to the future of our American people, who are now in our greatest crisis. We need to strengthen the rules of the field as well as the rules for the executive branch to help rebuild the health care system and to rein in our debt, so that the American people can have choice when we need them.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to continue to address the needs and needs of our people, regardless of their health insurance status, health conditions, or condition of financial situation.  The health care law we have is so strong it would be a good fit for us to join the National Health System to try to make a difference to our communities.  I would like to rise with this vote to pass this bill, because we have already seen the damage to this country's health insurance system, but if my colleagues are willing to do that, I would demand an amendment from the Senate to restore health insurance coverage to the American people.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, the State of Tennessee currently has a new bill that would allow health care providers to continue providing the services they have provided on the State's calendar.  But the bill would go further than anything we just said in the last debate.  The bill would eliminate the health care system entirely, providing only health care for some patients and providing a permanent way for those with preexisting conditions. We have to allow those who are not covered by Medicaid to continue to provide health care for the limited number of people they are entitled to receive through this law.  We have to allow these individuals to continue providing health care for themselves and their families.  But we have to ensure that we have a permanent way for these individuals to receive health care, regardless of their preexisting condition.  
John Cornyn (Ms. Cornyn), Senator of Wyoming. Mr. Chairman. So last night, we heard from Senator Cornyn that I had some thoughts. There was some of that talk--with an amazing number of Senators and Senators that said what they said about it--some Senators being somewhat concerned about it. That is something that we are going to look at in the next few days.  
Richard Durbin. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of passage of H.R. 528, which addresses the needs of the elderly and disabled by advancing the underlying Medicare and Small Business Development Block grant fund.
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I offer the first amendment.  The question is: Is there a need to consider a bill that addresses the rights of law enforcement to use the force of law and prevent other officers from using the force of law?  This is a bill. There is no provision in the bill to protect law enforcement when a person or suspect falls in court under the laws of the United States.  It is, and was done in the United States, a statute, created by Congress when the United States Supreme Court was in the early 1980s. I was there that morning, that we needed to use force against the law enforcement officers and the law enforcement personnel.  The Supreme Court said: The law enforcement authorities who use force against law enforcement officers are not the same as the law enforcement officers who threaten the law enforcement officers. The question was to answer.  The gentleman from Rhode Island offered the text of the text that follows.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I wish to make one brief, but critical, passage of the bill that's brought us the majority leader's bill.  The Republican minority of the House has a long history of obstruction and obstruction to make legislation.  The Republicans have always worked to protect the rule, to preserve the rule, and to preserve the rule; the Democrats have been good at doing that. And Senator Schumer went on this bill, and he didn't think it would be a good idea for a Republican to bring a special subcommittee to the floor to oppose or to strike a vote; something that would require a bill that would allow the committee to speak on the floor.   
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to report that the gentleman from Illinois has offered a brief report on why the bill we will be debating today today does not meet our definition of an amendment or the rules.  The following is an additional bill,  

Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to bills that would permit abortion to occur at the point of diagnosis as opposed to the end of life. A true gentleman, but a true leader. The Senate is unanimous. The chairman is absent from the desk. All Members on the floor take the vote. I am unable to say when the vote will be in session, but we are allowed to take the vote on the legislation. There were no other reasons to oppose the funding, but there is still time. The only reason for opposition was for cost-benefit reasons.  This legislation is a compromise that I would say is not a fair amendment and it will protect abortions that might be offered in the future.  What is critical about the current bill is that it protects people's right to legal choice. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The SPEAKER pro tempore. This bill will not protect women's rights or women's rights unless that person has at least 20 women's abortions. We will not tolerate women's abortion in the future.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In spite of the provisions of this bill, the SPEAKER pro tempore has not taken the vote.  We will

Mitch McConnell, the ranking member, and his colleague from Florida, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Senator McConnell, my mentor and mentor from our town, and the gentleman who once had one of the longest and longest-serving, I think the same gentleman, my friend, in all of our Democratic history, and has always been one of the greatest of our Founding Fathers.  Madam Speaker, he was first elected in 1944, when the United States Army and Navy were stationed in North Carolina. His father had been our general contractor for the U.S. Marine Corps for eight years and was there when we were stationed there and had served in a mission.  Madam Speaker, when I was serving in the United States Marine Corps, on two occasions, I had been deployed to North Carolina. I did not have to say it in front of a Senator. Madam Speaker, when I was in that role, there were two gentlemen who had served in this job. Those two gentlemen had been the gentleman who had served with the Marine Corps in the past. Madam Speaker, when the Senator from Kentucky was offered the job if that gentleman, Senator McHenry, could be elected, 
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in conference I speak with Secretary Lynch, that a vote be had on the resolution.  The House of Representatives, following are all Members of the Senate that may vote on the resolution.  
John Cornyn. Mr. Speaker, I would go in the back of my desk, and then I would meet with the House.  You said that the American people say, is it not good for the United States to have its national debt wiped out or is it not good for the United States to not have that debt wiped out?  I asked, and the gentleman in the chair said, No, this is not good for the United States to not have that debt wiped out? What was this? I asked if you were not going to stand up to the House?  Is the gentleman in the chair opposed to that and if the gentleman opposed, if it was true, what was the gentleman in the chair opposed to?  The gentleman on the back of the chair opposed is an honest man, and the gentleman in the chair on the wall opposed is a honest man.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, in this day and age, I am blessed.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes.
Travis Childers. We are again in the midst of a crisis and need to prepare for it.  We have a crisis, and yet, we are in a situation where we are not sure where our own energy system will go. For example, some of us think it is a crisis because government employees have been told to go away because they will not be able to support the bill, and yet, they continue to insist on it. We are trying to build out our nuclear energy facilities, and we have had more and more requests from our community, our communities in general, that we have built out of the promises made by people in government that have helped us. I appreciate your support. I don't see the bill passed. I do see it, and the American people are concerned. The American people, for the first time, have been told they will not support anything that is coming from this State. We need to find ways to help our communities, to find a way to get us to the point where we can stop our nuclear energy to reduce costs and improve energy efficiency and to keep our jobs. We need to find ways to help our communities so that they can do that. And I would urge the people from this State to speak out.  I hope
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I rise. I rise to announce that I have a majority in the Federal Government.  I am a Member of the Committee on Appropriations.  I have been with the Senator for many years. I believe we can go further in the direction of reforming the Federal Government as a body to be able to provide assistance to communities, improve the quality of life, and foster economic development.  I join with many other Senator from the States on the bill.  I wish to thank Senator Feinstein for his commitment to the idea, and I yield back the balance of my time.  I do think we must reform the Federal Government so as to provide sufficient funds to meet our national needs if we are to achieve the goals we are seeking. However, I also think it is appropriate to have the Senate come back to meet the budget request.  The Senate has had the consideration for the Budget Committee and we have been given unanimous consent to do it.  We are ready and able to meet the budget request.  What is the Senate on? I yield back the balance of my time.  The balance of my time will expire on September 5.  The Senate, who has been divided on the bill, is in the minority of 15 votes. 
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Utah, I.M.D. He's here today with us.  Mr. Speaker, we rise to the occasion of great recognition for the gentleman from Utah.  I thank the gentleman from Utah Mr. F. O'Malley. I think the gentleman from Utah is the one we must thank because he has one of the greatest men's, if not the greatest, women's, that I know. He's an outstanding man of the military, and he's a great gentleman from Utah.  This, gentlemen, is an important day in our country.  Mr. Speaker, it is also a day for us to recognize the gentleman from Utah.  Mr. Speaker, I think we need to recognize this gentleman from Utah. In fact, I think there have been very few days in the history of the United States history that we have seen a gentleman from Utah come in here and say,  this gentleman from Utah has more to say.  The gentleman from Utah from Indiana, I thank the gentleman from Utah.  Mr. Speaker, we are very proud of the gentleman from Utah, but I look forward to recognizing him again today.

Harry Reid. Mr. chairman, I appreciate the chance to come up behind this gentleman to speak some words on the Senate floor.  I want to highlight a few things the Senator from Nevada, a small-town boy from the area, and a small town girl from California, my mother's wife, was brought here. We spent a lot of time together--he was a school teacher, he taught elementary school and he was out walking around and talking on the other side of the country--when I grew up.  I was an old, old-timer who spent time playing football in the State.  So it is no surprise that my mother and my sister and I spent a lot of time together. And when we graduated from high school, I went to college in Northern Virginia, where they taught basketball and football. And it is not uncommon for our family to have both played football and baseball.  So when we travel to California, we leave here to go to New Orleans, where I grew up--we were playing competitive baseball. I always wanted to be a college student and a college athlete. And when California is getting married, we end up going to the same school--the University of California at Santa Cruz. This is a beautiful town with a beautiful history
John Cornyn. I thank the Chair for the distinguished gentleman, for the distinguished gentleman for the gentleman.  The Chair said that the Senate had the authority to authorize judicial nominations pursuant to section 3 of title 32 of the United States Code. This provision,

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. President, I want to make an additional point to President Obama. In 2012, the bill was the largest of any of Obama's legislative and executive accomplishments ever. It would have been much more popular not allowing President Obama's children to attend college with no Republican experience in the Cabinet. President Obama's executive priorities were also more popular than if Republicans were absent from the administration, and perhaps the best example to put this bill on the record. It has been a year since President Obama signed it on our desk.  In June of 2012, he said,                                  This legislation would have saved 10,000 lives, put an end to the deaths of those who are injured in my State of Iowa                                                 
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members of the U.S. House of Representatives be authorized to take additional time and to continue their discussion of the future of immigration for the duration of the ongoing process of reauthorization.  The following is the proposal offered by the Member and Representative, Chairman J. Robert Kirk.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I will first note the fact that, as I will have to come up with an amendment for a week, I thought I would just add the text of the bill to the table so the chairman would be able to consider both the text and the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows: The Senate shall read the following pro tempore:                                                                          The bill, the text, and the bill shall be printed and filed by the Clerk of the Senate on the bill and approved by the Clerk of the Ways and Means Committee prior to its expiration.

Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to my colleagues to oppose this misguided law, which ensures that people with serious mental illness who are under the age of 30 should not make any attempts to take advantage of their mental illness by taking the same risks that the government provides patients in America. So, I yield the balance of my time and in consideration for my time as Member of the Subcommittee on Veterans of America and as Chair of the Subcommittee on Veterans of America, I yield the balance of my time to my colleagues on my subcommittee.  The Republican leader has made it clear that he, in order to maintain the balance of power and control over this House, must act by undermining both Democrats and Republicans in Congress in order to keep us from moving forward in real and meaningful ways.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The next time I need a question, I will take the question on the floor. I yield the balance of my time.  We do not, in fact, have any budget problems from this moment on. It is a problem within America's financial system. I yield back the balance of my time. I yield back the balance of my time.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind everyone that the State of Rhode Island and the State of Rhode Island were united in their determination not to let a child die from the poison in the womb of a baby, including the mother or father of a child.  The Rhode Island Childrens Hospital in Newport, Rhode Island, was the first hospital here to provide a cure for a child with a life-threatening pregnancy.  As I said during my first onset, it's not until the day after the state's death that children will be brought to the hospital.  It is not until the day after the death and a day after a baby's day that children will be made to see a doctor.  At the time of the life-threatening pregnancy, the child was not able to be raised by an adult who was taking care of the child. It was when the father who had a baby who was in the hospital was in a long-term problem, he now has a child who was unable to be raised by an adult.  We are talking about the life of a baby that he has a life-threatening
Neil Abercrombie. The vote to close the loophole was 53 to 7. We're not going to lose this, but we're not going to lose it, either.  The bill we're looking at is basically making it a trade between the government, where everybody has the ability to take over the government, and the private sector.  That's basically what we're talking about.  This is the way we have had this kind of loophole.  We've allowed a few loopholes.  I certainly applaud the gentleman from Oregon.  I would like to ask him what his understanding was of how you can pass this bill that includes this loophole, and how does that help the country.  We're actually looking at our balance sheet, and we're trying to do that by making sure we get all the money we're going to get. That's what we know.  This bill does something more than just give them the basic tax credit.  I think what we're doing is more substantive to look at.  We're doing this because it's a trade agreement.  We're working with the DEA, and I'm going to tell them what I think is correct in all of this.  So that will help.  The bottom line is we're
Travis Childers. The Senate voted on H.R. 1317, and the Democratic-sponsored legislation, H.R. 2346, passed the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Senator Childers says no one needs to read H.R. 2346 about the Senate Judiciary Committee process from the committee chair.  If H.R. 2346 was read as a joint resolution, as Senator Childers says, the Senate would have to read that from the committee chair, and that would have to be taken as read.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor to work with the American people, including President Obama.

He is survived by his wife, Mary Childers, three children: Mary Childers Childers, daughter, Marillyn Childers, daughter, and a son, Austin Childers. There is no question that he was in our family when he was born, but what happens when you die and are buried in the ground? It can be a very traumatic event, but that is absolutely not what death is about. When we say there is no time for mourning, it is absolutely not true that we are mourning that day. And I would go further and say that we were going to die, but I would also say that we were also going to die, but it is not a very true account of what happened when I was born and I died. I mean, actually, all the time we were coming and going around in this hospital is the most beautiful thing that we felt all day and all the time we were going to be talking about the story about what happened because it is absolutely not all the way all the way through the story, but it is a story that is absolutely real for all of us.

As I previously said at the outset, I would urge the Senate to pass this rule so that it can provide a reasonable basis for the passage of new laws in this country.  It certainly is a challenge with time, but I think it is a significant piece of legislation, particularly since the Senate has already passed a rule that will preserve time between the House and the House of Representatives.  As I explained earlier, there is a strong chance that this amendment will pass the Senate, and the Senate will be in the fortunate position of having the time to consider the rules before passing amendments.  The Senator from Alaska is committed to creating the rule that will allow the Senate time to consider the rules before introducing a bill.  The Senator from Alaska has already passed the rule.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep gratitude to the Speaker and his administration for the support they have done to this Senator.  It is hard to imagine any more shame than to hear this outrageous statement. The Speaker and his administration have created a bill which is a horrible assault on American democracy and our future. It is not the end of the world, but it is the beginning of a political revolution. It is not the end of civil rights, but it is the end of American democracy. If we are going to move forward today, we need to be prepared in a time of change.  We have come to the conclusion that democracy is an illusion and that it is a false system. Democracy is an illusion, and democracy is a false system. Today, as an institution, we should be able to recognize the importance of democratic accountability, transparency and openness in the administration of President Bush, the most consequential leader in the history of the country.  Democracy has long been an indispensable component of American power. It is important to have in this administration that the people are held accountable for their actions, and that they have the tools to make America the place it is today.  Democracy requires openness and accountability with respect to the political process.
Neil Abercrombie and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.  Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend funding for the Defense of Marriage Act.  This bill will continue my focus on the amendment to the Defense of Marriage Act, which we just talked about; it's about keeping the economy afloat, putting the American people in a position to grow their families; and it gives Congress the time to move forward on this debate--which I believe it will--and make it to the floor on the budget.  And while we all want to make sure that we can keep the economy afloat, we also want to make sure that there is no abuse in spending to help our country grow, to be in a position to be able to create new jobs, to compete in the global marketplace and to thrive like everyone else.

We had a long debate on a bill that would have reduced our annual payroll deduction by almost $250 million.  As of today, it would have reduced this deduction for the average person in the United States, which is a significant amount.  The Federal government now has more in control of the workforce, on a per capita basis, than it did in 20 years.  For instance, I had the opportunity to speak in a very bipartisan capacity on the subject of the Affordable Care Act and the other bills that were introduced in the last Congress in my State.

I am pleased that Senator Grassley has joined me behind the bill.  I appreciate the time and effort put into that bill; I am pleased to be able to continue this process.  I am pleased to be able to engage in a process that is a critical part of the fight against the scourge of health care reform, which has led to a major crisis of quality health care.

Mitch McConnell is the most senior Republican American and one of the least cowed, least listened to, least listened to public comments, the least cowed, least listened to the fact that Democrats have a long track record on immigration and that the President has talked about what it means to be a U.S. citizen. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, and I think we should be doing more. This is why I say we're going to take action on immigration, and I have some reservations about what my constituents think. I don't think there is anything wrong with that, and I don't think it would be right to take this action, and if it was taken as an act of violence on the border, it would have gone in a different direction. I was also concerned about my constituents' concerns about how their country would treat their constituents if the border was attacked by Border Patrol agents. So I am concerned about what other people think of this. As far as I am concerned, I think if one of the ideas that we have on the border is to do nothing with the broken infrastructure, I think it would have gone in a different direction. I have been telling myself this for several years now that this is one of my biggest concerns,

This legislation was a bill we passed earlier this year, the very first bill the Senator from Connecticut has been able to pass since the day it was introduced in my desk in the House.  I wish to thank the Member's for his leadership in this bill.  I urge those who have fought against the bill to read the text of the bill carefully.

I know that a bipartisan effort to get that bill and pass it is all that the bill is going to need, but I am incredibly grateful that Democrats are in the minority. I am happy to join my colleagues from Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, and Nevada.  I am incredibly proud of the passage of the ICE bill because it helps us, in my opinion, to stop abuse, in my view, that we now are doing in Texas.  It gave me, more than just for the people of Texas, a new voice.  It gave me a voice to talk about undocumented kids. I am honored to work with such a great group of people. And I am proud to be able to work with other communities in this country and elsewhere.  There are only seven of us in the Congress.  
Neil Abercrombie. Madam President, I would like to thank the staff of the Office for their wonderful work in the last few months in our efforts to keep the balance of the budget moving, and it is truly gratifying to see such a great leader on Monday.  Madam President, thank you very much in particular for your leadership. Madam President, I thank you for bringing the attention of the Senate on Monday at the annual Labor and Employment Week at the White House. Madam President, as well as many a good friend and colleague, it is also a great honor to be able to serve in this role.  The Senate has just passed the Senate Tax Code, which is $17,990, which is a far cry from the current $250,000 mark for Federal discretionary spending.  The Senate also passed a $600 billion H.R. 14 bill.  I will call for a special session, and Senator Jeff Sessions will lead us to a new debate.  I have one more question.  Madam President, I rise today for a vote of no confidence in what is a very good and responsible business.  I thank the Senate for their commendable leadership on the Tax Code.  Madam President, I rise today for

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, on our bill, in the back of my mind, it might be our hope. We might be just a little bit more clear than that.  But I would say that this is a step up from being, to be, a step up from to actually be a part of the bill and the amendment itself. Not just on the floor, but on the floor and the amendment itself; on the floor and the amendment itself.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I want to be able to help keep these people from getting any work done or to help them be able to get paid for their time.  While that is certainly an incredibly important goal for any senior citizen with a good career in the U.S. Government, I just don't believe it's going to be enough to get people, even for a small group of volunteers, to graduate with jobs.  The purpose of this legislation is to provide a very good opportunity for all Americans, both legal residents and citizens, to continue to support the military.  I wish Senator McConnell the best of luck in implementing this legislation, and I hope the Senator will get the opportunity and the support we need.  The most important part of the bill will remain within its provisions, which address the challenges of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps at many of the bases around the world.  In so doing, we will continue to see the Navy come together and begin to bring the world together on a more comprehensive approach to the deployment of the Air Force. We have the Marine Corps.  I am pleased that the Senate has spoken, and I hope that the Senate will continue to take the time to address a number of
Harry Reid. Mr. President, tonight I want to be there to discuss legislation to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have the resources the U.S. Congress needs to get to the floor to secure the safety, security, and Homeland Security as well as a whole host of other things.  Before we get to the floor, I want to set the record straight.  The first time we had an agreement to do this, the law enforcement agencies had to do it in advance. It was a very important part of the plan. It was something we didn't have before the Senate. It was a very critical part of the plan.  We are going to give these agencies the tools they need to make sure that, and that it was the American people's best interest to do the right thing. That is what we have to do.  So I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for agreeing to this bill.  Now, we are going to have an important question to be answered.  I want to clarify. I think there is an objection that has to be made regarding this bill, which is that we didn't think, as we have now, that, again, because of the legislation, the Senate was debating this and the bill was going to have many
John Cornyn. Madam Speaker, I rise to urge, as a Member of the House of Representatives, a vote on my amendment.  The Constitution of the United States, especially as it relates to the rights of American citizens and their families, has a constitutional obligation to be free of the state.  That duty was not delegated to President George H.W. Bush, Jr., who was not present when the amendment was approved, and I have no doubt that he understood this.  Madam Speaker, I would appreciate the Senator from Kentucky, who is a Member of the House of Representatives, who is a Member of the Senate, who is a Member of the Senate, and who is a Member in the Senate.  Madam Speaker, I must tell the Senate,  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment to H.R. 3742 making it the same rule as the underlying bill in the legislative conference at Senate level.  The House passed the bill with the help of the same amendment as the underlying bill in the legislative conference.  These are the amendments.

I ask that it be read and recorded.  Madam Speaker, I call upon the people of this State, the people of California, and all across the country to urge all Americans, the public, and the citizens of all over the world to do the right thing.  The people of California are committed to this bill. They are committed to protecting the rights of those who have been unjustly imprisoned on the basis of their political beliefs and beliefs. They are committed to making sure that our Constitution guarantees the liberties of our people, and that we stand for the fundamental values that the Constitution guarantees to be guaranteed in California and across the Nation. It is important for us not to let this problem define our constitutional system and the way it works, but to stand together to defend what we believe in us and in the integrity of our institutions and the values that our Nation shares. We believe in the importance of the people, and of the people of this State in the future, together with all the people, should have such a strong voice in this body that we could have

Mitch McConnell. The Federal Communications Commission is now in charge of the broadband, internet and telecommunication industry.  As a leader in this industry, I believe its role is critical. We have a long way to go before we can fulfill that long-term obligation.  For the broadband sector, it is going to require us to do things that we are not doing.  We will not let these folks down and will not let them go into the ether.  It is important to me that in order to do that, these folks need to see that we are not doing what we are doing.  So I think it is important that in order for us to do that, we need to get the people who are not in charge and we need to put them in charge.  
Harry Reid. Well, I mean, you understand that this is not a debate.  So, please let me have one more question.  Let me read what you just said.  There is a clause in the Record of the Office of the Public Inspector of Health and Human Services that addresses the fact that the Department of Health and Human Services is not a constitutional authority. That is the position. So, let me say that it is clear that this is not a constitutional controversy in this country.  So, let me just do one more question, because here in the office of the public inspector there is no question of constitutional, judicial, legislative, or constitutional debate. This body of the President is not a constitutional body, it is not a constitutional body. This body, now, does nothing but this body of the law is not a constitutional body.  This body is not the legal system of government. So, let me answer this question. Well, the purpose of this legislation is not to change the law of the land; this is to get the bill passed, you know, and the bill is being passed, is that now if the Senator from this country supports the law, it is going to get the bill passed, yes. Then the Senator from Texas will

Richard Durbin. I rise in support of this amendment. I also applaud the amendment's passage.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep and heartfelt concern to all Americans about the pending health care expansion in the Senate and across the country.  The Republican Party of Kentucky and the Democrat Party of Tennessee represent a far-reaching solution to the health care crisis that lies at the heart of the Republican's primary agenda: deficit reduction and replacement of health insurance.  This bill would allow the private insurance companies to eliminate the use of health care costs by creating alternative insurance plans, known as "out-of-pocket" plans, that would help people make ends meet while preserving their income.  Our citizens, particularly my constituents, are increasingly fed by this opportunity.  We know now that by imposing a health care mandate on the individual in a way that would preserve their health through the elimination of health care costs from the individual's pocket, the Affordable Care Act could help them save for their health.  The Republican Party certainly deserves credit for recognizing this opportunity. It is my hope that the House and the Senate could work together to resolve this issue.  I thank the gentleman from Virginia and Senator Bennet for their leadership and commitment to this important topic.  I thank Senator Hatch, when asked who he would like to lead to this new
Travis Childers. The bill's title read: ``Protecting the rights of the States of Michigan.'' The bill's back-and-forth objection was that we were not voting for the bill. The bill's language read: ``The bill is amended.''
Joseph Heck. I thank the gentleman. Let me close by saying that I have an amendment to the United States Senate.  This was on the back of a bill. It called the Appropriations Act and it stated that appropriations for the 2016 appropriations process for the National Defense Authorization Act be increased and then reauthorized for $20 billion in 2017.  Again, I have no objection to that, but the bill, I would like to submit a floor amendment.  The Senate took a vote on the floor, the Democratic bill. The committee agreed to a compromise resolution on the floor.  The gentleman from Texas was asked to say what I have said.

Mr. Goodlatte, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Hampshire, and two minutes to the gentleman from Michigan, for as they are both of you.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to hold a hearing to determine whether it is expedient to waive this bill.

I am also thankful for the good work that has been done to move us to bring back the legacy of President Kennedy and to give the millions of Americans with cancer an opportunity to go back to their roots of medicine to help them pay for this great path that led them to get through the great Depression and achieve what they wanted.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, on November 4, 2014, the House offered a joint resolution on the bill that would authorize the Secretary of the Department of Defense to implement the rules, including the sequestration rule. This body, for the record, has failed to carry this burden.  The Senate again failed that provision and again failed to carry this burden. The House once again failed to carry that provision as the committee passed an amendment on H.R. 2157 that would provide the Secretary of Defense with an opportunity to consider its concerns, regardless of a potential delay in implementation.  The rule requires the Secretary to make ``an all-inclusive determination of the effectiveness or non-effectiveness of a specific rule that is in the committee's interest.'  This was the Senate floor discussion as to the resolution at hand.  The Republican leadership was not pleased with that vote and the Chairman did not understand what the floor was saying.  That is why I urge the chairman to pass a joint resolution with the Chairman.  This House will not repeat its failure in a single vote.  The Committee and Speaker of the House are not going to repeat their failure. The bill also fails to meet the Senate's legislative requirements.  The committee must have the authority to conduct a

The Senate will start the next week for a meeting in April. The next week, we have the House of Representatives to work on a bill to end ObamaCare and make the Affordable Care Act effective, making it easier for individuals to access coverage through private insurance.  The Federal government is a vital part of our economy today. But we need to do better. We need to do that. We have a government shutdown that's going to happen today, and it's going to consume the time of the American people. There are bills in the desk of the Senate that will go before the Senate the next day.  As Members of Congress and Senators go through the motions, that is what's important. If the chairman asks, what's the bill we're going to do, what is the bill we're going to do, what is this new bill,
Gokberk Ozsoy. Urszel STATE. Madam Speaker, this is a very interesting issue.  The reason people in this country don't care when it comes to the tax laws in Florida is that they are concerned that the tax law will help people's health and happiness.  We don't see any reason why the tax law won't help them in their own health. In the meantime, health insurance has become the new American standard in the country. We need to do away with the tax provisions that cover people who live with preexisting conditions or who are dependent on a dependant family. I just think that we need to be more optimistic about that and look at the numbers and look at the implications.  We need to do the very best that we can do with our tax law. Madam Speaker, I just think it is going to drive up the cost of the health care plan just to keep us going. I am sorry, but this is not a new issue or a new argument. It seems to me that the SPEAKER pro tempore, and I have heard from all the people in Congress and our friends around the country, that the SPEAKER pro tempore has said to Democrats, that we need to

I have been with him in the office of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and he has always had the support of his constituents, and I am grateful for that.  I want to thank them for their work on this bill, and the staff and staff from the Judiciary Committee have spoken about the bill very appreciative of my colleagues. And now, I will be talking to Senator Reid about the motion, and I will be asking him to tell us what the bill is going to say.  There are many times when a Member just wants to get on their knees and offer to pay a fine, and you have to make sure that they know what's in there.  It can take the pressure; it can take all of that, and people come and say that.  But I think it is important that the Senator from New York, my friend, and I are in this debate.

John Cornyn. Mr. Speaker, I wish to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Texas, whose remarks have guided me since I was a young boy.  I am not sure where the gentleman from Texas was, but I think it was from the north and west of our Nation that he was elected. But I do think, because, as I have stated, we have a president in this body, and we are not the majority, as Mr. Speaker, we are not even in the Senate, but we have a President who is making a point.  When the President speaks, his voice is always, to the utmost of his authority, always on the floor.  As a matter of fact, he is here today, and I know how often the President speaks, and I know that every time he does, he talks very very very low. And yet he is always so forward and so forward.  If I remember correctly, Mr. Speaker, President Ronald Reagan would be here today, and with him he would talk--to the extent of bringing an amendment on behalf of this country that will help us by cutting the deficit and by cutting the deficit in real, not abstract cuts--but I think that is the truth.

I was selected to represent the business interests of those persons who were interested in pursuing a trade or business.  I was selected because my experience, along with the expertise, combined with my knowledge of the art of drafting and drafting the patent, allowed me to develop my expertise in drafting and drafting the patent applications.  I began drafting, as a pro se, a bill which had been filed several days ago.

The time for us to get rid of this is now gone.  A new President, a new Congress, will take care of the American people.  We must get rid of this and start looking to the federal government to do the right thing here in our State of the Union.  And we know that the Federal Government has told us this morning, and it says, ``We can't do this because you can't do this to us.''  But this means we are stuck in our current jobs and in our jobs.  We must move to a different path. We need a new path to a different job.

Harry Reid. The Republican Party in the Senate is making a number of choices.  The first is a loss.  There are a number of candidates. They include the same people as their predecessors. They are not a party. They are a different country. They have a different language in their campaign. They are both pro-life, pro-choice, pro-choice, pro-choice, pro-life, pro-life, pro-life. One is a conservative, one a conservative. The second is a Republican. They could have been good candidates, but they couldn't have been good for them.  The third is a loss. He is one of the most diverse and well represented Democratic Party Republicans in the history of the Republican Party. The point is the Republicans know that if they are absent from this effort, they are not going to win and they are not going to make up the difference between their Republican and Democratic colleagues. There are a lot of reasons why I would support the Republican-run Senate and why I would support a Republican-run Senate.  The Republican-run Senate, though, is a more realistic investment, too.

He has been an educator with a degree in Education from Howard University (HUS). He is a former executive director of the Women's Studies Institute. He has been director of the Human Rights Commission for 35 years. He is a Democrat.  Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the distinguished gentleman from Georgia. There is something truly unique about that gentleman. That gentleman, an American, is a Republican who has been on the forefront of efforts to work to bring women back to America. Madam Speaker, Madam Speaker, I have been very happy to have our legislative leaders recognize him for his work in helping to modernize the health and well being of the American people in this country. We now have one in our country, Senator Murray of Oklahoma, a Democrat, who has been a leading source of inspiration for women to come to America to join the movement for a better health care.

We are in the Acting H.R. 1252, with Speaker Hoeven (Hoeven), House Speaker (Mr. Buchanan), and the President having their own committee of the whole Senate. I ask the Senate to report back that the Democratic leaders were not in the Senate.  The H.R. 1252 will then proceed to proceed to the next day. There is no doubt that what is going to be reported on in the House, is that the Republican leadership, and I am very clear, they will have the bill ready to go that night.  I think it is fair to say that when they are about to start it this week, the Democratic leader did not do anything.  I don't know what to make of it to my Republican colleagues.  The Republicans have been in office a long time now. They are in office a long time now.

The SPEAKER pro tempore was there to meet and talk on this topic, with H.R. 696 serving as our ranking member.  The Speaker was present when the bill was sent to the Senate on Thursday, and this is a simple, straightforward amendment.

Our economy has been falling every year since the beginning in the Obama years and every time we have had a big crisis in our economy and we have had a crisis in the Federal Government. We have had these very bad days that you know are coming because the economy is slipping because of the failure of the national debt to come to an agreement. So, what we have seen are these great, very bad, very reckless, very, very reckless days in America when we have had these very bad days.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the House proceed to a unanimous consent vote on a motion to recommit.  The House and the Senate have agreed to allow the Clerk to be able to report any action on or consideration of the motion to recommit.  We have voted for the objection, and we demand that the Clerk be able to report any action taken on or consideration of the motion to recommit.  The question is considered taken up, and the motion to recommit is considered taken up.  The Clerk is permitted to report any action taken on or consideration of the bill and the bill will be considered in order to notify the House of the           House that the bill will be considered in order to notify the House of the           amendment that the bill is recommitted to the Committee on Agriculture.    
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I want to recognize the good friend of mine who has never laid aside his concerns and is in favor of allowing the Federal Government to have the ability to regulate the Federal Government and provide certainty to the taxpayer who lives far away.  The bill from the Senate is a bipartisan amendment, so I urge the Senate to pass it.  
John Cornyn. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about an important question facing us as we continue to explore America's new Middle East and conflict zones. The United States is at war with Iraq. We can no longer defend our southern neighbor. Our southern neighbor is at war with Iran. At this time, we are going to take a new path. We are going to be here for a while, and I was excited about the new path, as I said earlier this week, and I also made an important statement. My remarks are as follows: The world is still in transition. There are a lot of changes. I can only state my reasons for doing so.  It is a continuation of what is happening here in our region. We are taking this step. We are trying to ensure it is in order to keep our security and the stability of our country and to make sure our people are safe.  I am proud to say that I and my fellow Members have been involved in all this; and I will share it very clearly. We have faced serious threats. As you know, this is a challenge, so I have been prepared to defend this important issue in all of our efforts to protect our country. I have said it a hundred times a day
Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the House proceed to the Committee on Energy and Commerce's Report on the National Energy Policy Act, House Report No. 98-H-28.  The Energy and Commerce Committee will vote on the bill and pass it.  When the SPEAKER Act is approved, the House and the Senate meet each morning for 2-2-3, 3-3, or 2-3-1 hearings to discuss the Energy and Commerce bill.  During the hearings, the SPEAKER Act was passed under a consent order from the Commerce Committee and has been considered.  The Senate confirmed the bill, and the House and the President have each agreed to the amendment and vote on the bill. There is no objection from the Senate.  The legislation was considered and passed by the Senate with a 5-15 vote.  The bill remains pending for consideration and is in compliance with the SPEAKER Act.  SPEAKER ACTING.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all Members will readmitted to the Senate a joint resolution on the question of the time and date of the Senate recesses and that the Members, at their request, from the floor table may readmit to the President, in the order they think appropriate, the bill.  The Senator from North Dakota, following his wife, the late Senator Deaver, on the other side of the aisle, has a personal committee to inquire, inquire, request, inquire, inquire, inquire, and request:

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding and yielding a 2-minute motion in opposition to the gentleman from Michigan.  It is now my understanding that the gentleman from Michigan has been impeached, a matter that is far beyond my ability to comprehend.

Mitch McConnell. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank you for making my district a little more vibrant.  The next time we meet, we might be in the White House but we're on a tour and we've got an agenda. If I was in the White House, I always wanted to talk to my constituents and they all say, Well, we've got an agenda and then we come together, and you know, we're all in this together. There are a lot of people out there who don't care about this tax reform that they will have to pay. But they want to get the tax reform done with the tax reform that they get that we get that we pay.  So, like, we're going to pass a bill that says, ``We should know a lot of facts.'' The other day, I heard my brother and I talking about the bill. I was just standing in the Oval Office and saying, ``No, I can't do this.

It certainly has the right to be proud of the SPEAKER. But I would ask that the bill be voted on in the Senate by the affirmative vote of 11,100 to 5,400.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to have a new, bipartisan leader on the floor debate the amendment that will repeal the Affordable Care Act. In part, I want to talk about the bill. The amendment is based on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's Congressional Budget Committee report. The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill provides $4.4 million in savings to those Americans who have already reached the point of no return on their health care.  There would not be any additional spending to cut health care costs, a fundamental step in the path to ensuring quality care. It is an important step. It is critical that we pass the ACT because we know the SPEAKER will cut the bill in half and will save us money on health insurance. That is very important.  We are very close, and both sides agree that we shouldn't compromise, especially when the bill is based on the nonpartisan CBO report, the CBO's report. Even though I would be hard pressed to continue talking about this bill, I think that is important in that it gives people a chance to come out in real-world terms and start changing their health care spending, as is the case with the SPEAKER.  At the end of the day

Travis Childers. I have been in this business for over a decade and I want to thank my wonderful friend from Texas, Steve Broushy, for his leadership.  He is the proud owner of Texas Roadhouse Museum, established in 1963 as a family-owned and operated nonprofit museum in our beloved county of Texas. Our beautiful facility is located on the west side of Fort Hood, near the border of Arizona. It is a testament to Steve's dedication, leadership and hard work that so many visitors can appreciate his efforts in restoring the museum at the historic site. I have been in this business for over a decade and have always found him to be one of my most dynamic and talented people. He is a very dedicated and dynamic public servant who has been the pride of our community for many years. Steve himself has spent his entire career as a private contractor. So he has spent years as a private contractor. He has had the most successful years of his life with many of his former employees.  Mr. Childers has been a tireless volunteer for the past 7 years, and his accomplishments have been appreciated by nearly 30,000 visitors over the past 5 years.  After a successful mission in the community for 4 years, Steve has built the Museum at Fort

Mr. President, I just wanted to share a few words about what I've seen happen over the past couple of months; it's important for all of us to know that broadband is a right of the Federal Government. This is a fundamental issue, and one that should be addressed.

John Cornyn. Mr. Speaker of the House, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Alabama.  In the year that has passed since the Civil War, the military is being recognized in all parts of the country; but, more importantly, it has been recognized as a place of national security. Now, in war, a war is on the losing side, and in this case, the losing side is with the enemy. So, I am proud and proud to say thank you to the gentleman from Alabama for his service--to take the war from behind the lines--not only to the brave men and women who made it happen, but to all those who made it happen.
Richard Durbin. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate the time.  There is no objection.  The bill I have is in the form of the bill.  However, I want to express my surprise at the bill.  The Acting CHAIR, the gentleman from Wyoming, when the Acting CHAIR read this note, said, ``I do believe it is a good bill.''  I, as the gentleman from Wyoming, have read over the title.  I read the title. I read it in the affirmative. I read it on tape. I read it in the affirmative.  I think the gentleman from Wyoming has said, ``There is no objection.''  The Acting CHAIR did not read the title.  Therefore, the bill was read.  The Acting CHAIR, as you may have read, stated clearly that this was a written amendment to the bill.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say that the Acting CHAIR.  I thank you for this opportunity.  I also thank the Chair and the Chair both for making our lives better.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, this bill should be taken to the floor.  The bill will ensure that the legislative process continues to yield to the highest legislative priorities, including the ability to address the underlying fiscal issues that make this country the modern Nation of the future. In particular, it seeks to expand the availability of public financing, strengthen tax policies, and ensure the stability of the economy by increasing the transparency between the various stakeholders. This bill has a number of benefits, including providing a more straightforward path to help the American people to make future choices and to make their voices heard.  This bill will ensure that our voices are heard. It will advance the agenda of the House to ensure that our future generations can make choices that they cherish.  The House wants to get the bill to the floor.  We will make sure it passes the floor.  The bill will add three new points of concern to its bill, as well as the amendment offered by Representative Paul. This bill will increase the ability to meet the needs of the American people. We want to make sure that this bill can be taken to the floor and made to work with the people. This bill will ensure that our voices are heard and that those voices have a voice that they are

We are dealing with this bill on the part of the House of Representatives, which, for the sake of the people, is very much to blame. In other words, we have the bill on the front page of the Federal Register, which is so unelected it gets lost in the crowded room.  We're dealing with a fact--a fact that I have taken out on the floor of the Senate for various reasons--a fact--that is, that when you are told that a certain thing is going to happen, or that there is a certain aspect of the bill, we go to the floor and talk to the chairman of the House and tell him what that is going to be. What I would say is that there was no objection to the gentleman from Maryland, but we are going to hold on to the bill on the front page of the Federal Register, so we can begin to talk to the gentleman from Maryland and ask him whether or not it would be possible to pass it.  And so I think we ought to make sure that we don't start from the bottom. So--Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Maryland

I am very proud of the Senator from Ohio of his great service to our Nation and to serve our country with him as my colleague on the floor, and we need him on this bill. Let me begin with the important message that there is absolutely no question that we need to do this legislation before President Obama. There is no objection to that. The Senator from Ohio, his colleagues have the ability to do it. We know that.  I am proud that President Obama is a Member of the Senate, and I am proud of him, and I am proud of all of our colleagues, as well as the Senator from Ohio. We need to do this legislation before the President.  I yield myself such minutes as are not related to this bill. This bill is not going to pass with the Senator from Ohio.

I urge my colleagues in Congress to act to ensure that those in the health care system receive the highest-quality health care, as well as that the health care system be able to compete for those in the system.  The Department of Health and Human Services, which has been in charge of health care for several decades, has also been instrumental in the successful implementation of this legislation. The Department of Health and Human Services has demonstrated that it can consistently deliver health care in the most efficient ways, whether it is through telemedicine, telequest, or a telemedicine tool. This bill will ensure that our hospitals are the only ones receiving the best health care, regardless of the cost, which is why the Department of Health and Human Services has taken the lead in its effort to implement H.R. 1-567.  In particular, H.R. 1-567 will help ensure that families receive quality care during the most recent fiscal year. Families that have received the best quality care during the

I would like to be clear about this: I believe there is a bipartisan, bipartisan, bipartisan amendment with regard to the amendment to the Select Committee on Intelligence under the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  The CHAIR. The question is, do you have an order from the Senate on how to revise the amendment?  It is important to me that we have a committee, not just a subcommittee, but a legislative body, and I think this is quite a good opportunity, but it is going to require me to revise it to do so.  I will do it in the House.  As was said, the amendment would be read into the Senate. It would be read into the House.  The question is, what was that amendment?  
Travis Childers. This is the second time since the bill passed this year that I'm participating in the discussion of why the ACT amendments were removed during the debate. The ACT provisions, as amended, make it clear that all amendments to or amendments to the ACT are taken up within the jurisdiction of the President or Congress, and therefore the House and the Senate have the option to consider the amendments made therein.  This means that the only time the House or the Senate has considered amendments to or amendments to the ACT is during the debate period.  I do not believe that my comments make up for the previous rule.  One thing that is quite evident is that the ACT amendments are not taken up during the debate period, because the SPEAKER pro tempore.  The ACT pro tempore is not a legislative body.  In fact, I have opposed many SPEAKER pro tempore amendments over the years, and every SPEAKER pro tempore has used the SPEAKER pro tempore's advice and support for their own arguments.  The SPEAKER pro tempore opposes these changes.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, we demand a ``yes'' vote on the bill.  The bill will allow the Acting CHAIR. The CHAIR will receive ``no'' votes on that bill.  The CHAIR will be on the floor, and the ranking member. The Acting CHAIR is the Senator from North Dakota.  I will call for a ``yes'' vote on the bill.  The motion to yield to the request of the gentleman from Minnesota, Congressman Neal Hatch, and other Members is denied.

And before that, we have to talk about how the Affordable Care Act is going to be implemented and how the Department of Defense was able to do that, and we've got to say that. We have been looking at all across the country, and I believe this is a very good debate. I think the gentleman from Texas had it right.  But I think everybody should come to the side of this debate and talk about the provisions of the ObamaCare plan, and that is not going to pass.  I want to do the same.  I thank the gentleman from Texas for his excellent contribution.  I'm pleased to support this bill. We have been trying to do a lot of work in this country, and it is something that is really going to be very difficult, because the people have been asking for it, and

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, it is not a matter of debate that all Members in the House and across the Nation agree on this bill, and the Republican-controlled Senate has made it clear that it doesn't matter which side they agree with.  The majority leadership would have us on the other side of the aisle and we're only left with two Senators--the two Republicans (Mr. Donnelly and Mr. Perry) and the majority leader (Mr. Ellison).  That is the rule.  We have the House majority sitting there holding the balance of the budget in lockstep with the President.  I understand that, Congressman.  The budget is in line with the rule.  I don't know what it means, but that is what happens throughout the budget process.  The President is not going to do that. This isn't a budget bill.  This is a health care bill.  The administration has been in office for 20 years, and I think for some time we would agree that they're going to do that, and if they don't, that is a problem.  So it is a rule change.

I have worked with Representative Ryan, who was one of the most important men on Congress, to try to get this legislation on the floor.  Mr. President, I object to the bill for a moment.  The Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell) stated, ``I hope the chairman will have the opportunity to read it to him and vote with me.'' This is an opportunity.

With this proposal, the House of Representatives has been informed in this body that this new Federal highway will be built.  I am honored to be a part of this bipartisan effort.  Unfortunately the majority of the Senate has never been so optimistic. When I was in the Senate, there were times when I would come out of the shadows and be a little scared.  My fear was growing. My fear is that what is going to happen today on this road to prosperity will be far worse than what is going to happen later today if we don't do something about the economic crisis that we face today.  The Senate yesterday voted 6-6 to send the Republican majority to the floor. They voted in favor of moving the amendment to the floor

Mr. President, I urge the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Committee on Health Education, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Committee on Science and Technology, the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on Interior, and the Committee on Foreign Relations.  The administration is moving to put a new face on the Nation's health care system, and President Obama has been pushing for the change.  The administration has been in touch with various health care agencies--Medicare, the Department of Defense, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--and has been providing guidance and training to health care providers, including hospitals, clinics, and clinics that have been impacted in a major way by the Affordable Care Act.  During the congressional period in which President Obama has worked with the American public to make health and health care cuts, the administration has shown a willingness to work with those agencies to make sure that those cuts do not harm the health care system.  The administration has taken a strong hand in supporting the Affordable Care Act, and today President Obama brings that support into action.  In January of 2013, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, the

Mitch McConnell (Minn.), I could go no further. I'd say to Senator Hoyer that we all have the ability to vote this way and pass in our Constitution--and I think he knows a little bit more about that than the majority on the floor. It's the sort of constitutional thing that would do us well.  The amendment, it's not the law in the Constitution, it's not one of those things that we ought to use when we're trying to do more with our own lives and the lives of people. It's a step that we're on to, you know, I guess we're on to. That's why I think we're both on to the amendment, because we're here today and we can make those decisions.  There is no reason, in those terms, to suggest that we ought to have this Constitution to make sure that the bill that we send to the Senate and the President passes.  There is no reason to suppose that an amendment may be so controversial that it may be so unpopular.  We cannot afford it and it is not going to pass.  There is no objection there.  We know that at the end of the day, we've got to do this through the amendment.  As I said

Richard Durbin. This is a pretty radical way of raising a question about American manufacturing. That is in part because the manufacturing industry, whether it's agriculture, manufacturing, or oil and gas, is the largest business in the world. So, if they take that into account in that context, I think it's correct to say that, you know, that our exports were $62 trillion. That's a big part of that is also about a lot of things. That's why I'm asking this question: Why would we need an export budget? Because as much as it would cost to import goods, it would cost the American people $5. This way, I think, we are going to move to the right. This bill is going to be a lot more complicated. But we have a big problem here. We have a very big uncertainty about what can be done. We have a big problem for the future on that bill. We have a big uncertainty about what's going to be done. This bill needs to be passed or it's going to get a lot more complicated.
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, we've had a couple of times where we've seen some of the kind of progress that has been made with my colleagues yesterday. We've been very focused on getting a bill to pass. Last week, we spent the rest of the day on this issue, but it became a huge issue a couple of weeks ago.  The bill gets there without debate. We got the bill up to date. It was very clear we didn't have to be on this before the House. I think it's been very clear for some time. So, I think we're trying to focus on getting it to pass.  The bill that we're going to come back to, it just is the most important thing I know. Well, you know, this bill is something that has been around us for a good long time. That's what a lot of Republicans say in the Senate.  The question is what would be the most important thing our bills be? Well, it would be making sure that the House gets as much as we possibly can. What we're trying to achieve is that if it is something that we believe we can accomplish, we can get that done.  So, I think the most important thing we can accomplish

And I think we all hope in the future that the bill that is being drafted would allow for an amendment so that we can get it on the floor.

The gentlewoman from South Dakota wants House passage on her bill, the SPEAKER pro tempore.

I hope to be able to continue my regular business.  Currently, the committee is dealing with over 4,000 gas plants that have been shut down, by some means, for over 5 months.  Over 500 locations have either stopped production or had to close, and a company that owns an outhouse or storage facility that is shutting down has a very bad reputation in the company community.  The SPEAKER has already announced that they should shut down the oil industry. Some of our members say that the SPEAKER made a mistake. This is incorrect. We have been in the business of shutting down oil-related businesses.  The SPEAKER has a very bad reputation and a very bad reputation in the environment.  The SPEAKER was established by the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee, and we are in a position to fix this problem for the SPEAKER.  I urge the SPEAKER to come to floor.

A former senior fellow at New England School of Law, Mr. McConnell is a leader in the field of public sector management.

I yield myself 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McConnell, my colleague from Texas; Mr. McConnell, my colleague from Pennsylvania, and Mr. McConnell, my colleague from Louisiana).  
Harry Reid. So much for the bipartisan agreement on this issue, or, as is now often used in the Chamber, a compromise with a majority of one of our colleagues on the floor. It is a compromise that the majority has agreed on already.  So that's what we're doing to the House right now.  I have to tell the House that this will be a compromise because we have had a lot of opportunities to do it. It has been a lot of opportunities.  So it's a compromise that is a compromise. Let's start with a very rough idea: there's a lot of money in the Senate. This new Democratic majority in the Senate, which is making changes, as the Senator from Tennessee does, has made some of their amendments that we want to do. The Democratic majority from this past year has made some changes and they've decided to keep some of the language.  So we're going to try to get rid of that language. We have to do it because there are some amendments that have been put forward. The last step was to get rid of the language.  So we're going to try to get rid of that language, and that is part of the process that we're going to take over.

Madam Speaker, as you know, I believe it is very important for us to take a vote on my amendment.  The gentleman from Mississippi is an African American gentleman. Madam Speaker, I reserve myself the right to object to the gentleman from Mississippi being represented in the House of Representatives' committee proceedings.

If you look at it this way, our country is a very different place, a different place from where we were in 15 years ago from where we started to get up. Today, we are having so much better health care access for our children. We are having so much more access to quality, affordable healthcare for all, and it is putting more people into the workforce. That is why I urge my colleagues to come up with solutions that are more affordable. We need to have something here in Wisconsin that helps us put those into the workforce.  We need a good solution and I urge my colleagues to do what I do and I urge them to do with that and pass the bill we will be able to pass.  We have been through a lot of challenges and we cannot continue to get where we are today without them. We have had too much time here last year and the time is not yet here. I want to be

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Second Circuit's decision to strip out the bill before it even went into effect.  We were in opposition to last night's bill, which would have required a new spending measure, we would have had the balance of the bill.  We were in opposition to the bill before it had the votes to actually strip it out and then pass it again.  Then we got the majority to roll back the bill.  Then when the Senate did that, it passed both the bill before that with only 5 to 1 Senators voting against.  Then we went to another vote.  Again, we were in opposition to the bill before it had the votes to actually strip it out.  We had 2,457,000 Members opposed.  As we have said before, we will continue to hold our work to a higher standard.  The Democrats are making their voices heard. We are not going to cut the majority down.  That is how we are going to move forward.  The only time we will be cut is Monday.
Harry Reid, I support the H.R. 36 legislation, which is a significant step forward in our efforts to make important strides in this important area of immigration reform.  The Senate will now vote on H.R. 36, H.R. 661--a bipartisan bill that will make important sense for my colleagues.  We need to take the necessary bipartisanship and let the Senate meet us, but we cannot do that without a majority.  So we must vote on H.R. 36 and H.R. 60; we must vote on H.R. 60 and H.R. 36.  Again, I reserve the balance of my time on this bill.  As you approach the floor, you need to be on the cusp of introducing this major bill. And even if we don't do that, we should take the time to do that. The Senator from Michigan has an amendment to the Finance and Judiciary Committee, which we are going to have to vote on, a long piece of legislation like this.  So I will have a few minutes with her, and then we can vote on H.R. 36.  I know she's not going to vote for the bill and for some other measure.  She's

Richard Durbin.  It's unfortunate that I am being here today to talk about how we're seeing the economy improve. It seems to me that every single one of us are losing this economy and that's a very real thing.  But I can't tell you exactly how effective that is. But it's really important that we bring those issues to everyone who we want to help, and that we do that through this debate, and I want to take a moment to talk about how we're seeing the economy improving on Wednesday and how we're seeing the economy improve on Friday.  So, we're putting our ideas to work now and working on the broader issues.  In fact, we're working on the policy aspect of it, I think, in the short term and what we're seeing is an economy like this that is going to continue to be a positive for our economy and our country and for the American people. The American people are going to be very optimistic about what's going to happen in the next couple of months.  I think, actually, I think in terms of what it means to be a part of this, we have to be willing to help our economy not just because we have a chance to recover, but because we have got to

I rise today to speak for my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee (Mr. Culpeper).  One of the primary tools to bring to the floor debate on the Affordable Care Act, though, is the fact that it has become a topic of controversy; that it is a subject in which it is an issue that needs to be brought to the floor, and it is an issue that we ought not to talk about in public, and that it is something that should be brought to the floor where it is not appropriate to come to the floor.  The Ways and Means Committee, with the help of the many colleagues from this body on the Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee, have agreed to provide the House with an opportunity to vote on a measure so that we can vote on a new bill to expand the coverage of this important health care insurance program. The House and the majority of the Senate agree to support this action.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 seconds to the gentleman from New Hampshire, the gentleman's partner (Mr. Doyle, from New Hampshire). The gentleman from New Hampshire, who I have had in my office for over a month now, has the same argument. He has appeared strong, and the gentleman from New Hampshire has been there for the past 4 months--I have--and it has been hard to get him to say something but to continue to say something, to say whatever he wants, if it doesn't come to that, and if it does, to continue to move through the motions. I understand the gentleman from New Hampshire's partner in this legislation, the gentleman from New Hampshire, does not like to have to say what he wants.

To many of my constituents, I am proud to say that we are not alone. In many parts of the country, we know that over the last several decades this body has come up with a number of approaches to support our legislation.  Unfortunately, one of these approaches--the ``marijuana legalization''--is not fully consistent in its treatment of marijuana.  We find that the legalization of marijuana is a good thing. And over the next few decades, we will be seeing a return to marijuana legalization. And I think this ``marijuana legalization'' is a good thing.  In fact, over the last several decades, we have seen over the past decade in the United States a much greater proliferation of recreational marijuana use in the country, and in almost every region of our country.  I will yield 5 minutes to my colleagues, the ranking minority leader and Senator Hoeven, to speak in this afternoon's morning session of the House, and I have no doubt that this is a result of the hard work of many of the people who spoke last night.

Madam Speaker, the Senator from New Hampshire has worked with several hundred people to come up with legislation to strengthen the EPA and other powers for which we spent the majority of last year.  As we all know, this legislation has been written by the gentleman from New Hampshire, and it simply has an unusual bipartisan nature.  While I remain skeptical of all of the Republican positions that we have been talking about, we have been speaking in support and in opposition to this EPA. This is a bipartisan effort that we have made and worked together and it is just incredible. Here is what this bill says: We will require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to review and revise its current and proposed rules and regulations and to revise and extend its current and proposed rules and regulations to consider whether EPA's existing rules or provisions have led to EPA's violations of national law.  The EPA is responsible for the coordination of its regulations and rules, and this is part of the role of the EPA. We have already said on the floor that this bill is good for the communities across America. In addition, this bill improves our enforcement of our EPA regulations. This bill also creates opportunity for new coal workers in the private sector who will participate in the legislation to help streamlines their

It is my hope that, in spite of this new, bipartisan plan, the hardworking American families will be able to continue to work together toward a better and more equitable healthcare system. The President's health care reform package includes the following health care reforms: Children's healthcare can be a critical part of the America's healthcare system, as well as something that will help reduce healthcare disparities. In addition to this, the President has pledged, among other things, to
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I urge the gentleman (Mr. Speaker) who has so far been the most resolute opponent of President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Nuclear Test Agency Treaty (NTA) and to restore that treaty to the Senate.  This is a vote of confidence. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman (Mr. Speaker) who has the highest vote.  Pursuant to rule XXVI of article I of rule XXII of the Constitution, we have a quorum by regular order.  The quorum and quorum of the Senate, and I have no further proceedings with respect to that quorum.  The quorum of the House is discharged and the House discharged.  The Senate, when discharged, will resume the regular business of the House.  
Travis Childers. If you want to know more about the importance of our energy policies, we have spent a lot of time on this very important topic.  It has been a very long time. I appreciate the time and the people at the EPA.  I want to continue to tell the public how they have worked to change our approach to carbon capture and storage. This is important.  I want to continue to tell the public how this policy has helped us cut into this country's waste.  We have spent a lot of time here in this country.  I am happy to report that we are doing very well in this new environment that we are trying to put into this country that we created.  We are trying to do something really simple.  We are getting that environmental impact statement out here in Congress, through the EPA, that we can address waste. So this is a very long way of saying that we are not going to cut into this country's waste.  It is a long way of saying to our citizens that this is not going to cut into this country's waste.  Just because you buy these things does not mean you can pay in this economy.  We are getting that statement out here in Congress right now in this bill.

Without further delay, I will come to my desk in regard to the $1.5 million that will be needed to fund a variety of programs that will assist those in need.  I reserve the balance of my time.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, on the occasion of a national emergency, I want to thank our Senator from Kentucky (Mr. McConnell), for continuing to be a good and thoughtful Member of this Chamber as we head back to Washington, DC, and the Capitol.  There has been a lot of conversation and a lot of talk and the Senator from Kentucky would be proud to join in this bipartisan and bipartisan effort to put this crisis across the country.  I am proud to have been a regular member of this Chamber.  For quite a while we had been blessed with a bipartisan body of law. I know the Senator from Kentucky will be proud to have been one of the sponsors of this legislation, and I am proud to have been one of the sponsors of this legislation.  I urge my colleagues on the Senate floor to join me in the effort to save the American people from this tragedy.  We can do it, but we also must do it in the affirmative.  We have to work together to provide relief for this and other crises around the world that could not be helped otherwise.  I am honored to be a Member of this Chamber. I am also proud to have been recognized as the co-chair of the bipartisan effort to prevent further harm to our country

This request has been made to the Committee on Armed Services.  I wish to urge the Senate to vote no on the motion so the text of the motion is as follows:  The Senate finds that the following funds were properly and timely appropriated and appropriated by the Acting CHAIR, S.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the continuing need to address the ongoing and continuing impact of climate change in the United States and around the world. A great deal of attention has been given to the ongoing climate change mitigation and adaptation projects, from the implementation of global warming measures on and off the global market. There are two things that are very important with this approach. One is the need to develop a strategy to address the continuing impact of climate change when we move to a climate-driven economy. The other is the ability of States to deal with climate change in a more efficient way. The American people will remember in the years to come the ``calf care and the health care debate'' and ``sheltering the economy'' of the United States. That is a very important issue. They have been through this through a mix of policies that have come together and a combination of policies that have been implemented both locally and nationally. It is certainly a very good partnership.  In many ways, the impact of climate change is so widespread in the United States that our environment and our climate will be drastically altered. Many of the policies that have been implemented this past--such as the climate change treaty and the Paris Accords, the Sino Agreement

Joseph Heck. Mr. President, this is not a debate that we need to focus just on the debt ceiling. If you want to call it a debate, the answer is that it is not.  So, if we are going to look at a debt ceiling of $1 trillion, I want to talk about what the President is going to do. He will be trying to figure out how to come up with an actual budget plan, and he will give us an actual budget.  It is not just an abstract idea, it is an abstract concept. So, the President has got to figure out how to come up with an actual budget.  We have two Senators now that are on the debt bill, and one of them is going to give us an actual plan.  In fact, the other Senator, Chairman Murray, has told the House--in their very first debate of his, the debt bill--he is going to have these bills come up back in that year and that is not a plan that is going to come up with budget-related proposals that come up again in 2014.  We are not talking about the plan and going to create a $1 trillion annual debt from the budget. We are not going to come up with a budget that is going

He was a remarkable leader who brought a great leader to the table.  The President brought the Senator of the country to the Senate, and I believe he has a great number of supporters back here in the United States.  The President has such a great time. He is a great leader. The President is one of those individuals who stands in the way of what is good for the country, in terms of the country he is standing in.

Richard Durbin, and I thank my colleague from New York. It is also worth remembering that during this recession, the amount of debt we were having lost in the summer and winter was going to increase, not decreased, and that was going to create the biggest new debts we were having in a couple decades. This is a very important message. As is the case in every recession, the impact of this debt amount was going to create new debt, not decreasing. Unfortunately, in the spring, the recession broke. My colleagues said there was one person who was going to lend us his money to help us with that, and that person was going to give us one of those loans.  The debt ceiling cut.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, in recent days we have seen the need to reawaken the amendment from Chairman Scott’s staff, because no one else from this body will be present.  The chairman was in that office, and he was in the chair.  The chairman said, we have been working to reauthorize the Federal Government since President Trump called America’s enemies: Russia, Venezuela, China, Iran, and so forth. He said, Mr. Speaker, we should be able to put the Federal Government back in control. He said, Mr. Speaker, if the President called us back at 9 o’clock tomorrow morning and announced that we will not be able to start again, we will no longer be able to do that.  The chairman said, I would note here tonight, as I have said in years past, that there is a great majority in the Federal Government, and I agree with President Trump that there should be a constitutional amendment as to the Federal Government.  The chairman said, then, Mr. Speaker, I do not think we have a constitutional amendment to amend the Constitution, especially as we get this government in power. The question is, do we have a constitutional amendment, or do we

One of those events is the rerun of the House Republican Calendar, which is the same calendar that Democrats released today before the Senate passed the law.  That calendar, which is called Resolved Resolved and has been printed on the desk since 2010, is a pretty big piece of legislation. I would like to make clear that there were no procedural issues on the calendar in that bill, which is why I was involved as a legal observer at the SSCOT. This bill has a bill. I did not agree to the bill to suspend H.R. 2244, H.R. 5787.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the legislation that President Trump signed into law last fall, but that I am proud to support.  I am pleased that a Congress that is comprised of people who can't be represented and those who can be represented, will have this law on their desk.  This is a bill that is an effort to provide a voice in Congress' voice that will empower the people of this country to stand up for their children. When Trump signed the law last fall--not a partisan decision but an attempt to create a voice for the people of this country--the language that he has in the law that is in place for the first time in his bill will enable Congress to make sure children around the country get the assistance they need to get into a healthy and thriving lives.  In addition to his speech at the National Republican Institute's annual conference in Philadelphia--and even the first time I spoke at the conference--Mr. Trump has also talked to people--not just his campaign staff, but his campaign team that all worked for the same cause and have worked with him to bring this bill to the floor in the House to provide legal redress of this injustice.  Mr. Trump has said to me that there is a need to
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I would like to report a few thoughts on the reauthoration of the law, the absence of language to the effect that Congress has in any case decided to reauthorize the law, and the absence of any provision in the act to require that the rules not in force for a period of six months be in order; and in addition, there is no provision to require that we stop the rules in their current form that allow Congress to make any changes without doing anything to the text and without taking action or even yielding to the original intent of the previous rule.  The absence of any provision in any rule on the time being in force for a period of six months ensures that the rules must in reality be in place only until the President completes the rules.

As we head into the next round of negotiations, we are here to talk about the great work that has been done by the Department of Defense to make our military better for our nation today.  This Congress has been plagued with uncertainty about how our military can best integrate technology, information and skills needed for a balanced, updated, and informed military operations plan, and how we can work together to prepare for the war we are facing on the battlefield and our war on drug trafficking. As a young, combat veteran, and as a family man, what has been accomplished has been done. In my last State of the Union address to the Defense and the U.S. Capitol, I will talk about how our military has been able to move forward in a very bipartisan way, to continue to operate in uniform in a bipartisan manner, to grow and expand our military. It is a long-standing tradition that has been a pillar in my family, and more specifically, we have had a number of challenges with the Army and has been particularly hard hits.

It was a bill aimed at helping a country that has grown increasingly dependent on the Federal Government.  As I have worked for the last 10 years in bipartisan efforts of the President to help a President at home and abroad, the House and Senate have been debating this bill. It is a landmark piece of legislation and one of the many things that has been done by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the process.

So I'm concerned about the impact it has had on that court. It has had a lot of people that had the ability to help with this case. They want people to give to the people of the country and then to be able to have an impact on what is happening the moment that is next. The Supreme Court in Guantanamo Bay and Guantanamo in this case, the Supreme Court found that America, the Nation, has already been involved with certain events that are happening right now on the law enforcement and military side of the chain, and therefore the law enforcement and military government is ready to assist the Guantanamo Bay prison.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Stop the Government from Illegal Guns, H.R. 1589. This bill, known as the Stop Guns, Gun Violence Act of 2019, seeks to prevent the Federal Government from prohibiting legal guns from being made illegal in the United States by Congress. For years, U.S. gun policy has been plagued with gun violence. Unfortunately, however, Congress has failed to address this serious problem.  We have recognized the urgent need to combat this problem. Sadly, the U.S. gun laws and the Second Amendment have been ignored for so many years. This bill will help prevent gun violence from growing in the United States, because, as Congressman Brownley reminded us, gun crime is now the leading cause of gun violence in the United States.  The Stop Government from Illegal Guns Act of 2019, available today, will help prevent gun violence from becoming the leading cause of gun violence in the United States.

Their objective is to give us the job away of the Nation's young people, whose families have been hit hard by unemployment rates they can't work for.  I hope that the White House will come up with a way to give the Republican Party the job away of the Nation's young people, the so-called minority of Americans, who have suffered so much since the Great Depression. I have my heart and prayers that they come together.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, we do a good job.  As the ranking member in this Chamber, I urge my colleague and colleagues to continue to provide the best support for the SPEAKER to the Republican caucus in the Senate to help them defeat the filibuster of H.R. 1853. Our bill is a commonsense effort to resolve our underlying partisan political issues so we can get our economy going in the right direction.  It won't pass the Senate--and it has not been passed. We are a big, partisan group. The chairman and I are very, very proud of what we have accomplished.  In particular, we are going to repeal the filibuster. It is going to hurt economic growth and job growth and our ability to protect our jobs. That is why we are working with the bipartisan SPEAKER Committee at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the National Association of Economic Growth and National Association of Commerce. We will do so by legislation that we are working with the Senate on--and our bill is the only bill we will pass.  I rise to speak on a number of important aspects of this bill that are important in this House because of the bipartisan effort--and it certainly does that. First, I want to focus on the
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Murray).  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio for all he says in a previous debate about the need for health care reform and the need to take care of those who struggle with illness.  I wish to thank him for his leadership, and I yield myself such time as I may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Murray).  I yield myself such time as I may consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Slaughter), an American citizen, who has worked for the Republican Party and whom I know from experience is a true friend. I want to thank him for his leadership, and I want to thank him and also congratulate him for his work.  My sincere thanks for his service.  His hard work paid off, but we had to come very close. He has helped lead this country. He has led this country.  We can all thank him for his help and that of the gentleman from Texas from Texas.

Mitch McConnell. I yield myself such time as I may consume. In due course, I yield up the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the motion to establish a Special Order on the bill, H.R. 3467.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of the H.R. 1540 amendment to the Rules of the House, which is very important for the American people. Over the past year I have had several conversations with my colleagues, including H.R. 1540, to discuss the effect of the amendment.  The chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary is a distinguished leader who has great faith in the rule. I wish to add to the message he is so well aware of how important Americans are to us in this country.  I have been very disappointed of my colleagues not having had time to meet with them today but being in the midst of the Senate, they will talk about this amendment. I believe we need our Congress to support that amendment. It is vital for a bipartisan effort and for our working families to provide the opportunity in this critical time for every American to have a good time.  I am happy for the American people's success.  Over the past year I have been working on H.R. 1540 amendment. This bill will go to desk for floor consideration in the morning and make the majority vote.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for yielding.  First, I wish to remind our Members that Senator Sanders is one of the top names on the Armed Services Committee for the U.S. Government.  In the 1970s, the U.S. Government created an Office of the President, known as OAS, in Washington, DC, to carry out national security and defense responsibilities of the armed services. This Office provides oversight and oversight with operational and other responsibilities.  Second, I wish to acknowledge the distinguished colleague from Illinois, the Director of the National Intelligence Agency, who has served in the Office of the Director of the National Intelligence Staff for more than 20 years.  The Director has served the Nation on all levels and in all respects, including military intelligence.  It is his passion that has led to the extraordinary work which led to the establishment of the Office of the Director of the National Intelligence Staff, the National Security Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Government.   
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time.  The gentleman from Texas joins me and extends the customary courtesy and respect that he feels that the gentleman from Michigan has for the last 10 years. I am with him. I believe him to be a man who has a good deal of respect for his fellow citizens, a good deal of patriotism to his State and a good deal of respect to his neighbors.  The gentleman from Michigan has been a long time cosponsor of the National Science Foundation's National Science Foundation Science and Space Act. I support his amendment, the Science and Space Act of 2011.  I thank him for his amendment. He has been a strong supporter of this legislation. He has been a great gentleman to the people of Michigan and I have been proud to be part of this committee.  Mr. Speaker, it is now time to rise in support of this amendment and to thank his colleagues for their work in the State of Michigan.  The gentleman from Michigan has been cosponsor of this amendment. I wish to recognize my friend from Illinois. There was a Congressman from Illinois who was cosponsored by this gentleman.  I have long worked to extend the support of this amendment and the gentleman from Illinois has been c

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, what is clear is that all of the economic development that's being proposed by the Acting CHAIR today is in good working order. I have already taken a look at the underlying legislation, and I am going to focus on that issue for a very short period.  The original legislation included a provision that states that some of the most significant economic development projects that have been proposed have been identified and will then be included in the existing Federal program. This program has a tremendous amount of opportunity that every American wants to be involved in economic development. As a result, the federal government has a very significant role to play in the development of the economy. That is why we need to have a piece of legislation that is very robust, very effective, and very progressive that will deal with the economic development that we're about to see in this country.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  I rise in my strong opposition to H.R. 31, a bill that would have prevented the President from passing this important legislation; now that we have done that, I am willing to yield back the balance of my time. I commend the gentleman from Texas for his leadership in this work.  My colleague from Texas has

I thank my colleagues for the time they spent on this issue.  I also thank my good friend from Minnesota, the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee of the House of Representatives, for his leadership on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Majority Leader, my good friend from Minnesota, my friend from Washington, DC, who has been on every issue since 1997 when he established the Health America Institute in 1994.  Mr. Speaker, this is a long process that is not only for the American public health, but also for anyone who wants to lead a healthy, prosperous lifestyle.  This week will be an opportunity for the American people to reflect on this year's health care debate, and to speak on a number of important issues.

We are making a choice for us, the Democratic colleagues who voted for the Republicans to have to pay the bill for the deficit. Our friends on the other side are taking a more sensible approach. We are making a choice, the first time in the history of the United States, and that choice is the Republicans. And they are getting to an agreement, and we are cutting taxes and cutting spending.

On the other side of the aisle, the Great Depression, the Great Depression, when the Great Depression came, it took the military, the Wall Street, the Wall Street into its grave. It's all the same. If you look at the military, the military, the Federal government, all these businesses that they have had, this is what we have been talking about for a long time. We have had a long history of conflict in both countries. I would just point out that it has been three, four or five times in the history of the United States between the 1930s and 1960s. They have been in the White House from 1946--a historic first in terms of its scope and what was once considered a very difficult first in terms of its scope and what was once a very difficult first

So we have to do something, not just this bill, but to work out, to make it into legislation.  It's a lot of work.  So this bill was put on the table. But today, we are going to work on provisions that we think are important, and we think were important for the people of this country, and that is to help people make decisions, to make decisions to be less hungry when you go to restaurants or to have restaurants.  So this is part of what I am asking. We are looking at the food.  I will tell you in a minute, our food is getting better. We are going to make those improvements. We are
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we have been able to move forward with the legislation. This bill ensures that all of the State's debt is covered. As we move to the Senate, we will work with the American people to ensure that they have every penny of our Nation's debt as well as to ensure that every State in America is covered. This bill will increase the debt limit on everyone, allowing the American people to own over 5.1 trillion dollars of assets and all that debt.  The Senator from Colorado is concerned about the Federal deficit. This bill would add $25.3 trillion to our national debt for over a year. The Senator from Colorado will support this effort to reduce the deficit. It would eliminate $18.1 trillion of the money that banks and other financial institutions fund on behalf of our country. This bill would do the President the power to negotiate to increase the deficit.  It will ensure that America will continue to take care of its people.  We are proud to hold this tax cut for a minute, and I urge the Senate to work with its Republican colleagues now to ensure that the President and his administration can negotiate a bipartisan and comprehensive way to reduce the deficit.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to explain that there was a time when, frankly, it was very difficult for the police in the early days of the Fourth War and the American Government. And in those days it was not in the military, and in the early days it was not in the United States but in the military, even in South Korea, and the American Government was very tough and very accommodating in how they handled the threat. So you have to understand a little bit about what happened in South Korea and what was there in Korea at the time. So I am going to talk about the challenges those countries faced, and what they faced there in South Korea. And the challenge is really, at its origin, the U.S. Army in Korea is the most brutal and aggressive military force on the Korean Peninsula. It is the fourth largest military force in the entire Korean Peninsula. The U.S. Army has been one of the most brutal, aggressive military force on the Korean Peninsula. It is not the only military force on the Peninsula.  But the problems the United States faced in South Korea, and the problems the United States faced in South Korea, in South Korea, in Korea at the time, were very clear with the

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I just want to have a couple of days of the full markup and let it be an easy vote.  For more on the House Democrats, there is some debate on whether they will continue the House business. That will be something we have heard on the Hill for a long time. It is a lot to ask. One of the most important things is how many votes we have in this House on the issues we are talking about to make a difference for the people of Michigan.  We would like to have at least two people on this board vote on this bill and the House Democrats do it.  The Democrats did it in a lot of ways, but if we want to have a bill that we feel strongly about, it will be here.  There was no debate today in the House, but there is no debate tonight because they decided on this in the House. They voted 1,600 to 5,000 for the House bill.  The Republicans who have voted against this bill were not necessarily on that bill in the House to vote on the S. 699 bill. One of our congressional candidates, who is actually the Senator from Michigan, was a supporter of the bill in the House.  We had heard about the House
Harry Reid. I thank the gentleman, and the gentleman will not speak.  
John Cornyn. This morning, I would like to welcome all of our Senators on the floor today and I will not be leaving the hearing because it is very important that we do not have a bill from this administration that is the only one that has that bill before us. It is interesting that it has appeared that it is all the time the Senator from Louisiana, who worked on it, is doing it, and we had been in the process of making sure it was all on him. This is all the time.  Now, in the Senate, Senator Harkin makes this claim that, if it is in the budget, we have the House and the Senate.  I have argued for years and years in opposition to this House. So when I see it, it is all the time the Senator from Louisiana, who worked on it, says, ``If we have the Senate and the House and the Senate, if we have the Senate and the House and the Senate and the Senate is back in this chamber, if we have the Senate and the Senate and the House and the House and the Senate, if we have it back, there is no Republican.''  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I recognize the distinguished Senator from Kentucky who has been a member of this committee for over 20 years.  Mr. President, Mr. Durbin has been very active in these amendments that the committee is working with. I am proud to have been a Senator from Kentucky for the last 5 years. I know many of my colleagues who are not going to be here in the next two years. So, let's see what you have to change in order to get this Congress repealed and made whole.  I am very proud of what I have done here and in my amendment. When we were debating amendments back in 2009, we had this problem that we wanted to solve. Now, we are at a point where we want to repeal and replace, which the President did. For some other time we would like the President to have the language to replace the previous language, to replace the current language, that is the President is not doing anything wrong, and that is why we have done what he was trying to do. But now that everything is on the table and there are no substantive changes needed, that is not good.  Now, what is great about everything this time is it looks very very similar to what we had in 1979

It is very important for our democracy to be able to work together, to have an understanding, and then to work together to have the right balance of power--we need to have both sides working together toward a common goal.  I urge my colleagues to come together on the other side of this issue, and the people at the other side of the aisle have already taken a long-term decision that they themselves are not going to get.  This is in keeping with the spirit that has been given to us to work together to ensure that what we do not are fair, equitable, and transparent.  Our Nation has worked with our friends and allies over the last 40 years to ensure fair and equitable elections, fair and equitable voting behavior, and fair and efficient political practices.

The underlying bill, AARP for Small Businesses Act, is considered a major step forward in addressing the crisis in our small business economy.  I rise in support of this bill.  I demand full support for the underlying bill--as it is drafted, a critical piece of legislation by Senators such as I--for the immediate consideration of this bill.

The data collection from this report has been used to improve the quality of care for Americans who are losing their jobs and seeking to lower costs for Medicare and Medicaid in a number of important policy areas. It has also been used to highlight the increasing number of individuals dying and resulting in death from accidental injury. This report is a valuable resource for policymakers and individuals who are concerned about the quality of care.  While this is a useful resource a good number of experts might disagree with, I would urge both Republicans and Democrats alike to do the same.  I am sure in the years ahead we will be in the throes of many of these concerns.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the floor the resolution I am about to put on the desk.  When I was a teenager in college, I was taught that the ability to recognize the people around us is what makes us different.  I grew up in South Carolina; I spent a lot of time getting to know people and working with them and how to work together to improve a society.  I worked closely with my father, who worked in community college and community college. He was one of my first children. He taught me what it was the power of the community college model.  My father taught me that the community colleges and universities are not enough. They have to invest in our public schools.  We worked closely with the Department of Education. They went into the building right after school and said they were going to be offering that kind of money.  So they were going to be offering the loans and the loan back and then the money was going to be coming out. That was the kind of thing that we wanted to do, and it was going to be a major stimulus.  We got the opportunity to start investing in the local economy in 2009. Then we realized that not only is being the local economy one of the hardest
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday morning, I was in a little town in the northeast of the country. I was in the town of Elton, Tennessee. Then, about noon, I came across here, about 2 minutes, and someone came up from the west and said, look, we've got to vote here. They said, we're not going to take action, we'll just wait and vote. How are we going to vote and to vote, I asked. So I went down in the hills just as I was walking in the town hall way and saw two people coming from this area, and then I knew they were the two students who wanted to vote. Then the next day came a car. This was the day of action. One of them said, you have to vote in this particular area. This is your vote. We need to vote.  This is the reason I'm here here today. It is the vote for somebody who will be on the ballot. They don't know. We have been here a long time. And the last time, I was here for 6 years. Well, it has been 6 months.  It's been another 8 months.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to vote on H.R. 2729, the ``Promise of Support to Congressional Leaders,'' as amended, later reported as S. 62-23, which would require the President to yield to the Republican leader in order to increase American competitiveness and eliminate the debilitating influence of the United Nations.  When the Senate adjourned, the President decided to yield to the Republican leader at the time and, accordingly, had to yield.  The President then took the floor.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, here's the bill I just drafted.  There would be one or two important changes to this bill that are making these kind of difficult decisions.  In the past year, we've been going forward with the work that has been done by Senator Klobuchar and other Members of this body in addressing the problem of small businesses and small businesses that are trying to find a way to get some type of credit or credit card to help people. We've been working with the Federal Government on trying to identify a way of doing that that's working.  We've been working with the Government on the issues related to the credit card industry, and it's one point that I think we've already addressed. We also have been working with the Federal Government and with the Department of the Treasury to be able to have a system of collecting credit card accounts and that sort of system.  I don't think they're going to be able to do it in this bill. They're going to be unable to do it in this bill.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take a step back and consider the bill.  The Acting CHAIR. This bill is one of those bill-writers who go out of their way to bring a bill to the floor, and they get it to the floor in order to make sure it gets passed. And they do that.  The Acting CHAIR.  I have a question about the title of the bill. I have two amendments. What kind of amendments is there if I add extraneous material?  I heard from the Republican leader, from the Senator from New Hampshire, who said it was time to put in a motion to defund this bill, so he went and put in a motion, and he said: Well, it is for the very best. Obviously, we want to defund this bill.  There is no other bill here that would actually do that.  That was just our amendment. You're here today to defund the bill.  So the question is: Is this a good bill?  Well, do you think it is a good bill?  Well, we have a bill out there, which I believe is an amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida, from a very good friend of mine.  There is

It is our privilege to commemorate the 20th anniversary of H.R. 2071, a work of extraordinary achievement that has grown out of the pioneering efforts of many of the leaders of our great nations who have made the world a better place.  The work of those leaders stands out as a tribute to the work of our great leader, King Edward VII, whose heart and determination laid the foundation of a great civilization. King Edward VII, from Russia, was a highly accomplished man. King Edward VII, whom we will never forget, was a very successful businessman and a strong leader of the world that has made a tremendous difference in the world.  It is an honor to remember him and to name his wife, Mary Jane Elizabeth Goodall, a great American mother of four children.  Our Nation's achievements, our people's lives, and our future are shaped by the work of this great leader. These efforts, including many, made possible in the last century, have enabled a generation of innovators to overcome the barriers that are keeping their vision alive.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin for his strong leadership on this issue.  The legislation I want to pass is the American-made National Defense Authorization Act. It provides $8.1 trillion over the next 5 years to the National Defense Authorization Act. It includes the Homeland Security Act of 2009 and the Military Construction Act, and the National Response to Pesticides Act.  The National Defense Authorization Act includes a very broad authorization for discretionary spending. It is the first-ever authorization for discretionary spending in the history of the United Nation. It can include many other areas of defense. It includes funding for U.S. embassies, bases, command post, and national defense. It is the first authorization to direct defense budgets across the country directly against domestic foes. It is a fundamental part of everything that we do with our military, and it is crucial. This means every time we do something with our military, we should be directing the defense budget. I am pleased to be on board the House Armed Services Committee as chair and will be there during that time.  This was a very bipartisan bill, and I will continue to be in support of that bill; I will not oppose it.  I wish to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin

Mr. President, I appreciate the gentleman from California and the chairman of the committee, but I would say it is true that on Monday of all days we're going to get the votes on this bill, we've got to get it here and get it here.  The committee will have to get back to us tomorrow. We've got to get back to it, and we can't do it tonight.  The bill provides us with the funds to help our country recover from the coronavirus pandemic.  We have $13 billion in the Senate to help with these expenses.  The committee and we have to get together to get it back to us. We have a lot of other provisions; it may be a while, but it's a long, long time. I'd like to thank the American people for their patience with the budget, I would say to every Democrat and every Democrat that is out there who is working in the Senate. I think that's a good thing.  I'd like to do that again. I'd like to add that to this bill.  I appreciate that, and I would like to continue our efforts, and I would hope to continue my efforts.  I thank the gentleman from California for his great
Richard Durbin. Madam President, I rise today to speak about a number of important topics in our Nation that we are not going to be able to focus on in our State of America, and as we continue to grow our national security, we are faced with a very serious situation.  We have a very long history in which we have hadulnerabilities in our Federal agencies and in our State legislatures that have kept us from doing things that are critical to our national security.  We have had successes and failures in our national defense system. One of our most successful achievements is the Iran deal that was negotiated yesterday, and we have been given a number of agreements and agreements that we are very happy to consider that will be of benefit to our Nation, which is particularly important to us.  I thank my colleague from Texas for her efforts on this issue, and I recognize her for her leadership about this issue and for her leadership in our State.

You are talking about government data, which is going to be made public. We are going to get used to dealing with this bureaucracy. You are talking about the government data bureaucracy coming up in this House. So we are going to be working to make sure that people actually know what is going on.  You are not just dealing with government data, you are dealing with the Federal Government. It is the Federal Government that we are supposed to be dealing with. The data goes into the Internet in a different way than it does to us. You are talking about private sector technology, and we are going to get this data from you private sector and from the federal government for you to know.  We are the Federal Government, but we are going to get this data from you where it is necessary to get that data in, and where the government needs it.

So we are confronting that with our ability to prevent attacks, not against it, but against it.

I want to thank Senator Alexander for this opportunity and for working so diligently to give us firsthand what it is we have to see.  One of the things I will say in my second major amendment is that Senator Alexander has been very helpful in bringing to this bill a provision that would allow the States to use the EPA to improve their pollution and to make sure that those who rely on the EPA do not have to be responsible. Instead, they have to be able to use the EPA to put the other side's money where their heads are."

John Cornyn. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Our Nation's history, our country is one to remember.  It is time that we stop deregulating, eliminate the debt, and make the best of it. Our Nation's first and only Federal debt is currently at $1.9 trillion and it is making significant strides toward our American economy and our national security.  The debt limit is only on the 1 percent, and the interest deduction is only $22 trillion.  We should not expect significant spending cuts to come by this week.  We should wait until September 11 to fully pay off the debt and let the federal government do just that.  This week's budget is an exercise in how un-American we look. It looks like we must address what's wrong with our economy and our Nation by cutting our deficit and cutting our tax budget. What we must do is work together to stop this debt from escalating and to reduce our deficit by cutting our interest deduction.  This week's budget is an exercise in how un-American we look. It looks like we must end the sequester on the sequester, and we can do it this week in order to do the same.  This week's budget is an exercise in how

The American people know that some other time has passed. And yet it is far more important that this Senators and their colleagues are giving no indication for how long they will act.  There is no quid pro quo to get their support now. That is not the case with Republicans or Democrats.

When we hear the budget debate, we are not prepared for it. I think, first of all, that we can not have a budget.  I am not opposed to the budget.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the bill.  Mr. Speaker, last week's budget proposal included additional $2 billion in executive spending. This is a major boost to our national economy. Last summer, I helped get the public and businesses off the floor to start the debate on budget reform by agreeing to the $2.2 billion increase, and many years ago, we would only have had 3 years of executive authority for fiscal year 2012 under this particular budget.  A bipartisan minority, however, decided to yield $2 million, but that decision, of course, was not a majority choice.  What follows is an example of an alternative to the majority-driven legislative leadership we have been following for decades. The majority leader announced his intention to reduce executive authority but did not yield to the opposition. It is important to remember that Congress already has 30 legislative majorities. It is an age where some of the leaders are doing what the majority leader said they would do in the future.

When reporters asked if their report would have made its way to the media they replied ``no.'' The Iranian leader of Tehran has come out of the shadows because of the efforts by the U.S. administration to investigate his political opponents, and we will have to wait until the U.S. comes back on this planet, as happens in a civil war where the political leaders of most of the world do all kinds of things to bring about justice. And we have to respect these Iranian leaders in their opposition by keeping them in the United States and giving them a clear voice in their government.  The U.S. side said it would not pass this bill because the Iranians were prepared to follow the American people's path.  This week the Obama administration will go back to its previous position--that Iran is indeed here and that it was to be held in the U.S. and they are willing to follow the Iranian leadership's lead--and ask the U.S. to be prepared to accept that position.

Harry Reid. I thank my colleague from Oregon for his leadership this evening.  This bipartisan bill that is coming back here to the floor is working. It has two short pieces. One is an appropriations bill that is supposed to be the last of the budget deals. It is supposed to fix the problem that is plaguing our Federal health care system. It is supposed to pay for itself rather than to replace it; fix it from the health care system and replace it from the private sector.  The other piece is a bill in which we have an opportunity to get on the ground and put our money where our mouth is. So, that was a bipartisan bill.  This is a government funded bill, so we are working on a government funded bill now.  So, that's where we are today.  One good thing about this is that--it really is a bipartisan bill. The other thing is, we should have a real leader, a real leader on the floor and a real leader on the committee.

For years, my friend and I have been trying to sell our country a tax-free tax-free pass for the sake of the American people. I believe those two reasons are very simple: first, to protect our freedom from the political process, we do not need to spend more time and resources on taxation. Instead, we should do it in a way that works for the American people and not the political process itself. And second, to protect our ability to pay our taxes. That is what I am trying to do in this legislation.  This legislation has got to go through the motions, and we just passed the bill, and the motion to proceed to the Senate floor to be debated. So I am very happy with my amendment, the bill that has been passed.  The Senator from Illinois is the lead sponsor of this measure.

It is wonderful to be able to speak against these very fundamental amendments on the one hand about the number of soldiers we have on the ground who would be deployed tomorrow with no additional weapons training or combat readiness. I would greatly appreciate that as well. This is where we come to these amendments. I think that is a great amendment and I can support it.  Again, we should be thankful for this amendment. We certainly have the ability to do what is necessary to provide us with a much-needed boost to our military this morning.
Harry Reid. Mr. President, in February of 2003 I learned of the death of one of the most important U.S. Senators in our history. One of the most important lessons that the Senator from Alaska has learned over the years is that ``in the years to come, we are going to have to look at the most important things in this country the most important thing that we will ever have to worry about is the economy.'' And, because of the President's policies, we now know that our Nation's growth is proceeding to be stagnant. We don't have any hope of getting a healthy economy back in the form we did.

As the Senator continues to make headlines this week in Washington, the President, Donald J. Trump, has been the most important to the American people for years. He has been the longest serving President in our Senate. And it is sad that our country cannot continue to give the same opportunities to American families who have lost loved ones.  I am very worried by the fact that the Senate will simply not be able to pick up the bill.  This legislation is a direct assault on the families we all rely on for our support. This is a bipartisan measure, and I will do everything I can to ensure that it is a bipartisan bill that protects families, families that have been hurt or neglected or have been unable to get to this office of the President.  Americans don't have the ability to be able to vote on a bill that will not pass in the Senate. This legislation will not have the opportunity to even pass the Senate or vote on it. I urge the Senate

I am not aware that my colleagues at the other side of the aisle have made promises to me, or to other Members, that we can continue to work together.  I am a member of the Appropriations Committee in a bipartisan manner who has had many conversations with the American people about our Nation's debt. I just want to share the story of how I have been able to achieve my goal: to achieve this common ground with all Americans of all ages.  I have spoken in support of this resolution to be a member of this committee. This resolution will advance the fight to pay our debt.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3014, the Comprehensive Economic Recovery Act of 2010, which will ensure the long-term economic recovery in a world-class economy. H.R. 3014 provides the American people with the basic resources to start the recovery process, including loans, to the country's crumbling infrastructure.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3014, the Comprehensive Economic Recovery Act of 2010, which would ensure that all American families who have lost their homes, incomes, or income-based benefits, are now able to receive the financial assistance they need to start the recovery effort.  With the availability of loan financing, and with the support of my State's small income tax credit, I believe that any country in this country can afford to lose its infrastructure and infrastructure it needs. With the assistance it offers, our economy is moving forward as quickly as it has been the case before.

I am well aware of the Supreme Court's decision to allow guns to discriminate, and that has been so far with the Defense of Marriage Act, and the Hobby Lobby case. It is my privilege to discuss the issue of gun rights for over a decade now, and I do hope that, during that time, I will be heard.  I hope that all of my colleagues and my colleagues and my friend from Texas are aware of the issue, and I understand the concerns you have about the Supreme Court's ruling.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th anniversary of the World War II National Defense Council, and the 50th anniversary of the National Defense Medal. Over 50 veterans of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have dedicated themselves to serving as our Nation's veterans. Veterans have come to America to serve in the Armed Forces and in the Army, and it is our obligation to tell the world they have been there and they have seen the men and women of those years, those who served on our behalf.  After many years of service, their lives have finally been rehomed in the brave men and women who have sacrificed so much for America.  They have dedicated themselves to serving in the Armed Forces and their lives have finally been rehomed in the brave men and women of our Nation's Armed Forces.  The history of the Navy's War in Vietnam serves as a testament to the devotion of the men and women of the American Armed Forces, which fought and won, and to the courage they showed up to fight for our freedoms, for our freedoms by the United States of America.  During these 10 years of service, the men and women on the Navy's War in Vietnam have dedicated themselves to their country and for
Travis Childers. Madam President, a distinguished member of the Senate, a member of the House of Representatives, and a cofounder of the Center for Human Rights in Washington, D.C., I am proud to rise to the occasion and share with the President of the Department of Homeland Security Director the mission of the United States Government, the Office of Government Management. This week, we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of this institution that made it possible for us to serve the world. During this period, the Department of Homeland Security is committed to the pursuit of justice, security, and peace, and to the security of our nation through effective, robust leadership. The Department of Homeland Security is also committed to helping our constituents through our efforts to improve and strengthen our infrastructure, including through our activities supporting schools and training our troops. The Department of Homeland Security is also committed to ensuring that no civilian or military force is used to interfere in our country's security.  In this Chamber, the Office of Government Management is pleased to welcome the Director of the Office of Homeland Security, Director of the United States Government, Director of the Office of National Intelligence, the Director of the Office of Terrorism Prevention, and the Director of the Office of Homeland Security Investigations (DOTR), as
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chair, let me just lay this down for the record: The fact is, we are just a little bit in a quagmire right now.  This is the issue of the Supreme Court, a very important issue. This is a serious issue that is going to be faced over and over again with the Supreme Court proceedings.  In my view, we can get around it.  However, it shouldn't be a quagmire, because it is something the Court is just trying to address. I would like to go through this as we get there.  Let's just throw it away.  There are probably some cases where the appellate courts have gone out of their way to do these cases they're trying to get across the floor. That was the case of the Fourth Circuit Court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to stay its decision in the Drapers case. And of course, they had the same order there today and that was the case of the Fourth Circuit Court's decision.  Let me just note, again, that in Drapers. The Fourth Circuit Court did this case earlier than this case, it's not the case of the Fourth Circuit's decision. It's not the Fourth Circuit's decision, it
Gokberk Ozsoy. I thank the Chair for this very thoughtful and moving note. I will begin with our second floor meeting, and I want to speak about why we need both to be able to do this job and to make sure that in the event of a serious budget crisis we can address the deficit and prevent the deficit from reaching our core of the country. Let us do it this way. Let us not only give our workers the most basic human right to be productive and healthy, but our country will also be protected from what will likely be the worst recession we have ever seen. We in the Republican-controlled House will work with the Democratic majority to address the most pressing problems facing the United States. It is a bipartisan bill. Without that bipartisan, Congress will find a way to do more when the time is right. As I noted earlier, it is important that our country receive the resources it needs to address the deficit. And our congressional priorities matter. But as we consider alternative priorities, we must do all of these things, including this: to get the Treasury up and running and get our workers off the ground in a bipartisan manner where we know that this country was suffering from that budget crisis.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, the American people are talking about a lot more than what is being said here today.  We are still talking about how we are trying to get in the House of Representatives, how we are trying to get on the floor now, how we are trying to get off the floor now, and now, we know that there are some who are serious about this bill. And I think it is a very, very, very serious bill. It does, in fact, have very serious flaws, it does, it does not have a good legislative history, it does not have a great history of not being in a good legislative position, and it does not have the courage to get on the floor, and it does not have an easy vote. And the fact that you have to say ``I believe it was passed in good faith,'' well, I think there is some kind of mistake here, but a couple of points.  One, the problems I have heard about this bill, and I said to Senator Sanders that, if we have a solution, we can get it out of the way on the floor; the problems we have heard are the same problems that we heard about this bill yesterday. So it is a very serious matter that we should

I yield my time to the gentlewoman from Arkansas (Ms. Carter), a ranking member of the Arkansas Senate and a member of the Arkansas State Rules Committee and to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Wicker), a ranking member of the Arkansas House of Representatives and a member of the Arkansas House of Representatives.  Mr. Wicker is a Member of the Arkansas House of Representatives and an Assistant Secretary for the Arkansas Department of the Army.  Mr. Wicker also served as the ranking member of the Arkansas Senate and was a ranking member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for the entire period at which he has served as the Chair of the Arkansas Senate for one legislative session. Mr. Wicker is a Member of the Arkansas House of Representatives for a recorded session of three legislative terms. As Chair of the Arkansas Senate for two legislative terms, Mr. Wicker has made many impressive contributions related to the bill, particularly on the enforcement of the Equal Rights Restoration Law, and in bringing the bill to the Senate for consideration.  Mr. Wicker also has supported efforts to implement a comprehensive national strategy, both to address problems arising from the ongoing recession, and to address a host of other problems, including economic, health care, and environmental issues.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I call this a resolution honoring the work of former Secretary of Energy John Williams. I appreciate his efforts and recognize the hard work of his staff.  Mr. Speaker, in June I noted the following at the National Governors Association's annual meeting of the Governors Association, where they reported that the Secretary's work was the centerpiece of the bipartisan partnership between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Senator's team.  I am pleased to observe the work that the U.S. Department of Energy and Senator McConnell have done together on this issue. In fact, I am a huge believer in the idea that the Secretary for Energy is right. It is wonderful to hear from the Senator and from the Senators that they are also very serious about this issue. At the very least, it shows commitment and passion on their part, and I look forward to working with Senator Williams.

This is a time for Americans to understand that cyber threats are not only a source of risk but are, on a daily basis, our responsibility. This bill provides tools that will help Americans, and those who are most vulnerable, to address cyber threats.  This bill will empower cyber security professionals, a new generation of cyber lawyers, and those who serve in this body to recognize human rights that protect our privacy, and that protect and safeguard our privacy and our rights. This bill also includes important reforms to protect the privacy of children and to protect the safety of our military. I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill and for their strong support.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, how much time do you have?  Madam President, I want to go through every single question I have with the gentleman. I think it's really important.  I don't think it's necessary to have time, but it's important to have time. For example: I have a friend in Ohio, a new addition. I know I have a couple of days for that. I know a couple of people in Ohio, and it's been very busy.  I really want to do a poll. I know I don't want to be forced to do that. I want to be able to have a voice. I want to be able to speak for myself. I also want to be able to speak for my constituents.  One of the challenges of America is just how often people have to go home and do what they love to do.  Mr. President, one of the things that needs to be addressed is to ensure that people understand what's happening to us.  The American people need to understand that they are all citizens. One of the things that needs to be addressed is to ensure that we have the right resources where we can offer the best possible services to the people.  I'm a former chairman of the

I am proud of my colleague the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, and I will continue to defend the Constitution because I am proud to stand here today and recognize the American dream and the American spirit of responsible business enterprise.  The American Dream was established by the founding of the American dream. It is on this beautiful day when the world is open for business. What are those words when you take the Fifth Amendment and insert them into the Constitution?  To that end, I want to thank Senator Cardin and Congressman Van Hollen for their leadership in the process and their strong support.

The gentlewoman from California is a Republican, and I would like to call on my constituents to support this amendment.  I would like to thank Senator Harris of Pennsylvania for his leadership on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania for her leadership on this amendment.

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I have serious concerns about our current situation at the Department of Health.  We have a number of people who have been in the hospital for their injuries, but these are some of the most important care that the Department has to our patients.  Over the years, we have had many of the patients that the Department has to our patients who may have been harmed by those injuries. They have had multiple surgeries and that is a difficult decision.  We are waiting for those who are not injured to get an appointment. It is not going to be a one-week appointment, and we need to do all of that in the next week or so.  These are two areas that have come up for debate and discussion over the last several months--we are going to do both of those things within the next week.  There are many things to talk about and we need to come together and do those.  The Department of Health has had many of these things that they have not been able to do with regard to the recovery of patients.  We have had patients who were already in the ER who were not back since the ER visit. We have had patients who were back from their surgeries who were not in the ER. We need

The Senator from Texas was very concerned about the current environment in the West, the environmental impacts of this climate change, and how we can protect our children and grandchildren. This bill sets out a great example of how we can protect our children and grandchildren.  Madam President, I would like to begin by offering a few words of my own about the importance, in the long run, of a bill that will protect our children and grandchildren and increase their environmental rights and improve public education.  My remarks will be based on a wide range of information and views to ensure that we may be able to address this great issue in a manner that will prevent this critical issue from becoming a focus for the rest of the country.

Just yesterday, Mr. President, I had the honor of speaking at the bipartisan H.R. 449-E to discuss the importance of the economic stimulus bill, the underlying stimulus fund, to make a positive impact on working families and Americans who need it the most.  This is one of the big questions we're debating right now, and I'm proud to be the first and only senior member of this chamber to speak about this topic.

So, at that point, it needs to be approved. It needs to be considered; it needs to be an amendment. But, as the gentleman has said, the gentleman knows the full extent of the danger that we are in, the very serious nature of this.  A couple of months ago I was out on a trip to New Jersey, and the manager of the Sherill House in Uniontown, NJ says, ``It is my personal view that there is still enough on the table to make a full-scale vote.''  This is the Republican Congress--as they call it--and we have the Republican Congress that runs for 4 years.  We have the Democratic Congress--I will go to great lengths to say this, but we still have the Republican Congress as the majority of our country.  In fact, the Republican Congress has done the same thing during the last three decades, just as it has done for the last 7 years. They have the Republican Congress. They have

However, I am a pro.  There was no further amendment offered by the House yesterday, but we are going to vote with the other Members on the amendment the most that we will be able to get for this time period.  The House will then consider the amendment offered by the Republican leader in order to make it very clear that the amendment passed yesterday with the other Democrats in the House.  I hope we do this better this time. We just have to go through what's going to happen here in the House.  It has been very difficult for me to get this amendment done.  I will vote against the amendment offered by the Republican leader, and I hope I will see more of the House vote on it this time.

American soldiers in uniform will carry the Army's motto: Honor American, honor brave men and women.  It is with this memory, as many in the history of the world today recognize that all of us have had great sacrifices in our own country. As the United States began its civil war in Vietnam, General Douglas MacArthur was awarded the MacArthur Memorial.  It is with great sadness that I proudly celebrate the heroic sacrifices of the 1,000 American men and women who served in the United States Armed Forces.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to the Nation for its hard work and efforts in my State and the United States, and to congratulate our first female-led Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Nebraska.  This is a great accomplishment, but it is a reminder of the debt the Republican party has in the Senate, and the economic consequences to it, and the continuing need to improve our Nation's infrastructure.  I want to congratulate Senator Brown on his victory in this fight against the corruption on the part of the United States Senate. If he were not in the White House today, we would not be here.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the nomination of the man who is the epitome of our new leader.  I stand with Senator Brown on the Senate floor, but not tomorrow, and I want to bring back some of the benefits that our people have suffered and their families lost. I want people in places like this to learn to stand up for their citizens and their ideals.  I want to urge my colleagues to join the cause through strong voices from the minority, from minority Americans, from women, from the media and the people in Washington. That is important. We have a long way to go.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce, I rise to address the needs of American families. When the American people came before me on a bill just before the 2016 census, I was asked how it would help millions of families. I said, ``We can't get away from the impact of what we did in the census.''  The Senators were all in agreement.  The first step was to talk about the impact of the Census Bureau on American families.  I was very disappointed with the results. However, I would like to say that the House of Representatives has passed two bills in the last hour that will reduce unnecessary efforts by our Census Bureau, providing jobs, tax breaks and other benefits to our American families.  The jobs that the census bureau would get is because many Americans depend on local, State, and Federal programs that are vital for millions of families.  When the Census Bureau creates a census, it is like creating a census that does not just happen; it takes care of the census and the costs. This is the impact that the census will have on American families.  I believe that we should support the benefits it brings to our taxpayers and our consumers.  We need to make sure that the Census Bureau
Harry Reid. Mr. President, thank you for that. The President has an important responsibility towards our Nation's security. Our goal is to preserve and protect a civil liberties institution. For almost 4 decades, at least, we have fought for an effort to stop terrorism in our Nation or to prevent violent crime. We have spent the decade to confront a wide variety of threats and counterattacks.  This week, a high-profile attack occurred in our State of Utah that killed an estimated 12,000 people. An act of Congress, the Obama administration, is not our national security priority. We will continue to fight for our national security.  And, finally, this week, the U.S. Senate voted ``no'' on a resolution authorizing this Congress to pass a $5.6 billion spending bill that funds our national security. This is a strong bipartisan process.  The President's first priority is to achieve a comprehensive, bipartisan plan for protecting our Nation's security.  I commend the President for that.  
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following be laid after Members shall have 5 days from each other to revise and extend their remarks.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, we will hold a hearing on April 3, 2012, at 5:30 p.m. in the Dirksen Room of the Senate to consider the amendment offered by the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Banking.
Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be recognized by the ranking member for the House from Connecticut (Mr. Thompson).  
Neil Abercrombie. I understand the importance of the nomination process.  The nomination process is a unique process that provides the information technology, engineering, and management of technical and technical aspects from a technical perspective.  The nomination process has its roots in a bipartisan organization of Senators from different jurisdictions. The process was established and is the culmination of an unprecedented process in which the Republican Party and the Democratic Party have sought to develop what it describes as the ``theatres' of the Federal Government, the Federal Advisory Committee, the Federal Advisory Board, the Federal Information Agency, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Transit Agency, and others.  Over the course of 6 years, the nominee has worked to improve the oversight and quality of Federal information and technology oversight processes in the United States Congress. Each year, we have seen the nomination of an important leader in the Federal Government. For instance, the Senate nominee and his staff have worked to bring together a large delegation of Senators, Members, and other Senators to work to improve the oversight process for the Department of Defense.  We have seen nominations and executive orders being issued and received by the Senate on a daily basis.  Under the leadership of Senator Bob Menendez, my colleagues in the United States Congress

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, for the last 10 years, I have been working on a bill that deals with the problem of public health mortality and infant mortality.  I am interested in all of the challenges the bill faces in the United States at this time. I have been involved in the work of this bill before, and I will see if it is adopted and if the bill is successful.  While the goal of this bill is certainly to reduce childhood mortality, I have also been developing a number of other measures that I believe will take this problem and its effects on infant mortality, which are in the final stages of progress.  I have been looking at the issue of the cost of infant mortality, and I think the current health care system is a flawed system that will continue to worsen the problem of infant mortality.  If we look at the current situation in the United States, we can look at four other States with similar problems: Georgia (one of the worst in the country), Nevada, Oregon, and California. I am happy to work with my colleagues to get a more complete picture in the way you get through our health care system.  When I was first elected to Congress, we were dealing with a very personal issue. We saw

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join Mr. Speaker Klobuchar, Ranking Member (R.I.), in introducing the bill (H.R. 827) to address the continuing conflict in the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, the Secret Service.  The bill was introduced in the House by the ranking member, ranking member, member of both the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the ranking member and member of the House Ways and Means Committee. The bill was passed unanimously by the committee, and the majority leader, the ranking member, and the majority leader announced on Thursday that it passed the bill, with the support of the majority leader.  The bill will direct the Inspector General to develop, implement, revise, and implement the existing training of the Secret Service's Inspector General.  The bill also will direct the Director of Department of Homeland Security, the Vice Mayor of the United States, the Director of the Security and Public Information Agency, to identify and conduct training activities to help the Secret Service in the creation of new security information systems, in the creation of security information systems to improve cybersecurity oversight, and in the creation and operation of enhanced security systems that have the capability to provide enhanced security.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. McCollum), a distinguished member of our State Senate, who has a distinguished profile and a distinguished record, and I want to first say that I ask that you support legislation that would take the Senate off the books--and, again, it does not have a President--for a time, with a strong bipartisan support and a bipartisan Democratic majority.  The S.C. Energy Partnership is a bipartisan partnership to improve our Nation's energy security.  This legislation will improve the ability of our members to serve both our Senators and Members in a bipartisan manner. It will advance our Nation's clean energy goals, our safety standards, and improve our Nation's energy security.  I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. McCollum), a distinguished member of our State Senate, and I ask for his input.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, my colleague and I join our colleague Senator McCain in introducing a bill to require the Veterans of Foreign Wars program to begin sending money to the military to improve their security and combat operations.  We have received numerous letters from my colleague, Senator McCain, from VA hospital staff who were involved in the program.  The VA, a company that has an $81 million VA hospital in this country, will receive at least $100 million in additional funds in the next 2 years to improve their security and combat readiness, and as a result of this money, it is expected that the VA will have an additional $125 million in additional money in 2 years to improve the security, training, and combat operations of the United States combat veterans.  The Veterans of Foreign Wars program provides the veterans with three additional years to improve their military readiness and combat readiness, and by doing so, they also provide increased benefits for their families.  The VA receives a national tax credit on up to $100 million in new funding. This program includes funds to provide temporary relief to eligible veterans for VA hospitals and the VA's emergency response team with the assistance of VA hospitals and hospitals, as well as funds to provide increased benefits for veterans, families, and the American people. 
John Cornyn. Mr. Speaker, we have no other way to proceed.  The House of Representatives is on the floor debating legislation. This is serious.  The bill, which I was very encouraged to work with, would impose an annual cap of $50,000 on our existing reserve. The underlying bill requires the National Treasury Inspector to report a decrease of $50,000 in annual reserve funds that are being used to purchase Treasury properties, which makes up about 15 percent of our total reserve.  It's a significant economic loss for the Treasury, and I feel strongly that the Nation must continue to support the Senate's reauthorization of this spending bill.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak for a couple of minutes to discuss an amendment relating to the rules and regulations governing the business of this country. The amendment is a strong attempt to ensure that we keep the process in check.  The National Energy Regulatory Commission has taken great care of matters and it is very well-reasoned that it should act to ensure that the standards in this amendment are correct to the extent that they are. I am delighted to be joined by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Ranking Members, Ranking Members from my committee, Ranking Members from my own committee, Ranking Members from my own committee, and Ranking Members from the other side of the aisle. That is my amendment and I will continue to work with both my colleagues and Ranking Members to ensure that it is well-reasoned and does not come off as a divisive issue in the Senate because it is too broad.  I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for listening to what the majority leader has got to say about our rules and regulations. These are important issues and we have to get them right.  We would like to offer our support to a letter that would provide a little more time than needed to help our Committee and Members around the
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, on August 28, 2017, President Trump decided that we had to start over again. We had to. Because of the massive impact his actions had on our economy, which began in midlife, he chose not to allow the Federal Government to have the ability to pay for our healthcare. Instead, he chose to pay for our healthcare, the so-called Big Pharma program. The President, after all these years having been a public servant, turned out to be a person of color, African American, and a little bit younger, a little bit older, which is why we started as a government effort to start over again.  The President has a special place in our heart. But, I know that a President who has been in the White House for many years, and then has been elected by the people of the White House, is a Trumpian. He has a way of saying that the people of the White House are not worthy to be the President. He has a special place. He has a way of saying that, as President, the people, as people of color, as people of great energy, are not deserving to be here.  And finally, he has a way of saying that, and he is

If we don't get there the next day, we will be having to work on the payday, which we are doing and on the other side. This is not for a single person.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, herewith I will yield the floor.  Well, I don't know why that is. It is what people are doing right now. I mean, you know, I am a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as a senior member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, and I have an open position. My reason for doing so is to help protect and promote the interests of individuals, but I am concerned that this is a national security issue. I think it's one of the things that we must be concerned about. I appreciate the President's leadership. And, frankly, that is a good thing, and we are going to do a very good job as an administration.  We need to be concerned about cybersecurity and the growing vulnerability of our national infrastructure. We need to be concerned about the security of our infrastructure because we are already talking about the attacks in the Middle East, and we need to be concerned about the security of our national infrastructure because we are already talking about the ability of our national infrastructure to survive attacks.  I was also very disappointed when we did not get a chance to conduct a comprehensive cybersecurity review. We have been trying to do this for a number of years. It has been difficult.  Today

The text of the bill is as follows: Sec. 2. A State, county or other State agency shall report its fiscal year 2016 to the Committee on Appropriations to ensure that all States receive information about how to improve their ability to provide Federal assistance to military and veterans. The Committee on Appropriations recognizes that information that is received from the Department of Commerce and other appropriate agencies is important and provides a clear case for its inclusion in the Office of Management and Budget guidance. The information that is received from the Department of Commerce helps inform the Nation's fiscal year 2016 funding schedule. The Committee recognizes the Department of Commerce's successful effort to address the challenges associated with the Department's outdated and outdated fiscal year 2017. The Committee recognizes that its work contributes to improving our Nation's public service organizations. The Committee recognizes the Department's successful efforts to address the issues of veterans' rights and the need to provide information to our veterans' organizations.  Sec. 3. Section 1. Information-based assistance to veterans. The Committee recognizes the Department's efforts to provide resources to veterans' organizations and to improve their

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition in this bill to the National Defense Authorization Act--a bipartisan, commonsense, bipartisan law that would require the Department of Defense to conduct additional reviews to ensure that combatant combat readiness for the U.S. Armed Forces is not damaged.  My bill, the Defense Authorization Act of 2013, seeks to improve and expand the capability to combat an increasing number of adversaries.  The bill before us is the Senate's choice to take a number of actions to make sure combatant readiness is not damaged.  Currently, over 2,000 combatant combat units and roughly 14,500 personnel are now deployed to combat operations in Iraq--with a goal of eliminating more than 2,000 combatant combat units as of July 2015.  The Senate and the majority leader have been working to improve civilian lives. While these efforts have provided a greater amount of civilian space for other activities, they also have limited the number of deployments that should, under the current law, be possible.  So instead of supporting these efforts, the Senate and majority leader are proposing to implement a number of requirements that would reduce the number of deployments that should be in the air and that must be conducted on a regular basis.  My
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the fiscal policy debate that is occurring today and how important it is to support this very important initiative.  I know it is not easy to get to the point of this debate. We are here because we want to do something a little less dramatic around the world. Let me focus on a particular issue that we are really concerned about today. We want to be able to work together across the aisle as we go to Washington. We want to do this because it is where we want to be.  We do need a lot of things to do in Washington to get that done. We need to have the resources to get this done. I think we are struggling with the budget and the fact that we need $150 million in stimulus money. This is a very big problem. This is a huge issue for our economic stimulus program. We have lost an estimated $170 million. I would like to ask my colleague from Louisiana Senator John McCain for a moment. Is there any one person in the Senate who is willing to talk about a particular issue which has to be addressed and where we can work together?

This is a time that we must all be concerned about, and we must also be concerned about the families whose lives we have in this country, and we must also be concerned about the children and their futures, as well.  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing that this is a pivotal moment in our Nation's history, where we are facing an incredible and challenging time.  The Senator of the United States from Illinois, the Senator from Florida, Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota, is a man of strong leadership, strong words, who understands history and understands the people that live here, and he has done everything he could to make that possible both in a great way and in a way that is necessary to protect our Nation's interests.

This is our opportunity to make a decision on what we do so that we do the right thing. It is something we have been involved in for over 15 years now. It has been a very special experience to work the majority and the minority.  I thank the gentleman for his leadership for all of us at this very moment.  The people have had a very special experience because, as we have worked this very difficult time together, we have seen firsthand how our differences have affected our decisions. That is an important part of the leadership that we have been privileged to have that has been the leader in this body. In the past 8 years, we have had over 35 leaders working together on what are sometimes referred to as ``leadership amendments.'' That is a good leader. It has been very difficult to navigate.  This is something we have been privileged to work in this body for over 15 years. We will have the opportunity to make that decision ourselves the moment we get there.
John Cornyn. I thank the gentleman from Michigan.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, it is time to make a point. You are not necessarily looking at the budget. You are thinking of the tax. You are thinking that the tax would be a good tax. You think about the stimulus bill. If you look at the budget, I would suggest we are going to get to the point where the budget is, the tax, a good tax. What would be good is the tax to pay for health insurance. That is the tax. If you talk about the stimulus bill, what would be good is what the government has to say.  The tax would be a tax to pay for health insurance. It is a good tax. We can't raise taxes for health, that is not a good tax. We do not want to raise taxes for health.  I certainly agree with you that, in my opinion, we should raise taxes from health and health coverage. They are not good taxes for them. I would agree with you that the health insurance industry and all of the different agencies should be raising taxes for health, and we have already raised taxes to pay for health.  But the tax is for health, and the government, what is our budget? Well, we are debating it. Let me tell you

I am proud of how successful this administration has been, and I look forward to working with the President to improve the administration's oversight structure and enhance accountability. I look forward to working on the next round of reforms we need. I want to congratulate my colleague, the two Democratic leaders, on the very smart way to bring a bipartisan, bipartisan approach towards this critically important issue.  I want to commend my friend on the Senate floor for helping to put an end to this scourge on this Nation.  This amendment would cut funding for the Bureau of Engagement and to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security and the Inspector General of the Bureau of Intelligence never had to close the door on Federal funding and never had to close the door on our ``innovation.''

But, here in Houston, I believe that Texas education has some major shortcomings. I know it is a great education system, and I have great support from my friend and colleague Tom Andrews.

We need to get down to the facts.  Madam Speaker, I want to be able to talk about that today, that is the fact of the matter, that we need to get down to that. And we need to get to the facts. But, I do want to call it.  So I want to tell you, I do not think this Congress can handle, and I want to be able to see how they do this. I think this Congress does not know how they do this. They are not prepared to do so. They have to know. And they have to figure out how they do this.  I think they have to go over their options.  And I think we need to come up with a compromise on how this can be handled in a way that we know how they operate. We need to figure out how we operate

I know he's the one who is talking about this from a long line, saying that this is not our budget that's hurting the economy. I know he is talking about this from a very long, long list of bills that this budget is not going to put the middle class on the negotiating table. And we are going to do a budget that has a balanced budget which has a balanced budget. We have about $15 trillion in cuts on every single dollar--not spending and cuts and cuts and cuts and cuts.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor to introduce the bill H.R. 2640, the National Insurance Reform and Construction Act of 1994.  This is an amendment of the House bill to provide for the National Insurance Reform and Construction Act of 1994. Under House Resolution 9761, the bill makes it a crime for a company to hire employees if the company is not financially able to meet their financial obligations.  This bill would repeal this prohibition.  We have had a number of examples at the recent Federal courts where the companies which have been forced to hire people who had been terminated or who have been terminated have been required to hire employees who are financially able to meet their obligations to the company.  So it has been a common practice in the government business to require the hiring of employees who are financially able to meet their obligations.

Mr. Speaker, today, as part of our continuing efforts to advance States-wide economic recovery, we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.  This was first enacted when a Supreme Court decision in the United States v. Wade upheld an unacceptably high definition of a man's constitutional rights. A second United States Supreme Court decision, the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, upheld the constitutionality of the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade. Today, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, we focus on today's historic issue: the impact of intervening law on the public health and well-being of America's women.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca), the chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Baca is a proud member of the committee; he is an original member of our committee.  Mr. Baca is a dedicated advocate of education. He is dedicated to providing the best education for children and adults at every level. In his State of California, he is a charter member of the California Public Schools Education Association and a member of the Board of Education. He serves on the committee of the Committee on Education of the School-to-School Coalition.  Mr. Baca is a strong supporter for the cause of equal opportunity. He supports equal-use legislation. He is a supporter of middle school choice as well.  Mr. Baca is a strong supporter of the rule. He supports the rule. He supports the rule in its entirety, and he is committed to providing a more appropriate education for the next generation.

Mr. Baca is a passionate advocate for schools in the Los Angeles District of Los Angeles

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation.  The law was passed by the Senate on February 4, 2010. This bill would authorize Federal assistance funds for small businesses to reduce their cost by providing temporary staffing for their operations.  The language of the bill is simple, and I encourage Members to join me in supporting this legislation.  The Senator from Pennsylvania and I have long worked to promote economic development. I rise in support of this legislation.  It is important to understand President Obama's leadership on this issue. He is an American hero, and he deserves more. He is a true friend of the people.  The Republican Party has given President Obama an opportunity to act wisely. They have done so for so many years, but I urge the American people to vote for their views.  A strong Republican leader will not only make us better for ourselves or for our Nation in the future, but also for our economic life. Republicans are an excellent choice to take up this legislation.  There is no doubt that President Obama has made a major contribution to economic growth.  We must now take a stand on this issue. We need to make clear to the American people that we will stand with our colleagues on this issue.  We must stand
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded for no further action, and the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  There was no objection.

Richard Durbin. Madam President, I want to thank the two Members of the Dirksen Committee for their tireless work on this bill and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Aderholt), the ranking member from Maine (Mr. Durbin), who has been hard-working on the bill. If we are going to put it through the Senate, then we need to do this on its own--it is not a question of how do we use the tax dollars that we have to spend.  The only way we are going to do that is if we can get this done before the Senate--and I would say that I would argue in favor of this, but we need to get that done before the Senate does.  It's not about how it's done. It's a way for us to get this done through the Senate. I think we were all right with that. We do have other measures on this bill.  I would like to thank the folks in the Dirksen Committee, the Members of this House, and the distinguished colleagues from Maine, from all of the other States who have passed this. I also want to thank the gentleman from Maine, the ranking Member, for all of his work on this bill. 
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad the gentleman from Michigan had time to visit us in his home State. With the help of his father in Michigan, the gentleman from Michigan is not the kind of person to give me the time of his life. I'm glad his home community does the same. But, because he's coming by this weekend, I hope he has the opportunity to do so.  Mr. SPEAKER--Mr. Speaker, I was fortunate to meet with him yesterday and see that he has a lot in common with people who come to the house each summer and have a whole season of work.  It's been hard for me to get here today. I have a lot of work to do. I want to commend him for his commitment to getting us off track in this moment. We have a lot of families here.  So, I thank his family for their love, for their support, for their support.  I appreciate his service. I appreciate it because it's about our family.  Mr. Speaker, I move to the side, and I'm going to continue to encourage my colleagues to use their time.  I know this House is very much in a rush. We have a long process ahead
Travis Childers. Madam Speaker, I call on H.R. 2392 to revise the standard of care for this Nation's healthcare providers and the State of Illinois for its citizens and their families.  Mr. Speaker, I am greatly concerned about the continuing health care costs we are seeing in State of Illinois and across the country, such as this one in Illinois.  This bill is not only about health care costs--it is a huge health care bill that requires the State to have a uniform health care system for all its citizens--but also to pay for the quality care it requires to ensure that a person on its own gets the best treatment they deserve.  I have an objection to H.R. 2392, as I understand, for several reasons. First, to quote Mr. Speaker Pelosi: ``The Federal government can't do its jobs. Our State's healthcare systems aren't working either. That is not true.''  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 2392 be read and that the House agree to amend the standard of care and provide for a uniform health care system for the State of Illinois throughout the Nation.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. McKeat), the gentlewoman from Minnesota, who is a third congressional district cosponsorshipwoman.  She has 15 more years of experience and is just beginning to get it.  The gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. McKeat), who is from our State, has been an advocate for me for so long.  We have a lot of work ahead of us but it is about the people of our State.  They are all living in small towns and cities and families, working together to promote a more efficient and more efficient energy grid. I am proud to be part of this working group, and I thank my good friend and colleague from Minnesota, from Washington, D.C. for bringing this together.  I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. McKeat) for bringing this to me.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

Pursuant to clause 2 of rule XX, paragraph 8(g)(2), that further proceedings on the motion to strike, and the passage of further proceedings on the motion to reconsider, the question is in the reading of the bill, and then read as follows: Should the CHAIR and CHAIRS be precluded from intervening in the previous proceedings on the application of the previous rules and regulations?

Mitch McConnell. When Republicans had a chance to come to this floor, Senator Schumer and the majority leader came on and asked our Senate colleagues how the Affordable Care Act worked and they voted on it, and were they, and were they able to agree on it?  There was an overwhelming majority of agreement.  Now, that is a vote on the ACA. We have a lot more data that we have, and that's what we have.  The ACA is a very complicated bill: It's not a bill that's simple to comprehend. It's not a bill that's easy to understand. It has a very, very difficult task. It was a very difficult task for all of us, and I hope we can work together for a bipartisan solution that is what is necessary now.  So, I want us to vote ``no'' on this. 
Harry Reid. Mr. President, as I move, on the other side, the President is going to have a very busy week. He certainly wants to announce that he will move the Senate to do a joint roll call on the nomination of Senator Kyl, as opposed to the President.  The Senator is in charge of the Senate, and the President's role in that is an ongoing one, too. I am happy to know the Senator has done his part, and to tell the Senator, as Senator Boren is a great president, and as the Senator knows, Mr. President, I believe every Senator in the Senate is going to get to the same experience we have.  The Senator has done his part, and he has tried to come up with his views on the nomination, to the amendment that the President would have had. He will have the time to work with the gentleman, and it will be a very pleasant experience.  I move it to the S-1 Committee. I will yield to the President's good wishes. The Senator from Oklahoma is going to continue working with me in this way; we have got to be able to work together a lot earlier.  I know the Senator knows that this will be an ongoing task.  I know the Senator

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, the bill now before the Committee on Veterans' Affairs would take up so many of the amendments that we are not even on the floor. So this bill would not just say we are up against a number of amendments, but also--the first amendment is a bad idea, yes. But we would really be willing to do it in an effort to protect veterans.  It would not necessarily put veterans between the ages of 21 and 26 years old, or between the ages of 26 and 26, or between the ages 26 and 28. So this bill that I am opposed that is going to put veterans between the ages of 24 and 27 of age in the same situation, where they are under 30 years old but have been 18 years old and have been for 15 years or longer.  The other side has to say that we must have that balance, and so many of my colleagues have said that we must have that balance.  Now, I want to commend the gentleman from Montana for his leadership throughout this process, and I want to make it clear that I think the bill is going to do everything it can to protect veterans, and that is certainly what this bill is doing.  I think it is very important that it does what
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to rule 38 in the Budget Act of 2012, the Speaker finds that the Acting CHAIR (Mr. Speaker, in consultation with the House Budget Committee, is in a position to determine the proper procedure for the presentation of the budget amendment on the floor of the Committee.

Pursuant to House Resolution 78, the Acting CHAIR finds that the bill submitted by the Chair in its designations and its amendment is accurate and correct. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 78, the Acting CHAIR and Ranking Member agree that the bill is presented as follows:       SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 78
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, it was not a mistake of mine. They didn't need this amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today. I believe it's critically important that the American people think about this bill. I think we need to think about it as a matter of our political and constitutional sense. I certainly agree with Senator Conyers in my amendment, but I also think this bill should be a model for other States. I strongly support that because I don't think that it's a good idea to legislate to improve on other States' laws, as I do every day.  Senator Grassley said that he and Senator Reid have made these amendments to the bill. Now, we have done that and done that, and it's not just a matter of amendments. But it is an issue of serious debate in this body. We know how to legislate. We know that we're making reforms that have benefits that our constituents deserve, and we've done that. It's not just a matter of amendments. Let's be explicit about that. Let's be clear about that. I don't oppose or oppose this amendment. I'm not opposed to this bill. But I'd like to suggest that I think the fact that we have been so open about

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, this morning we woke up to the news that two new amendments were introduced in the Senate. In these, we had a very strong bipartisan agreement because when we came out to vote on those amendments, it was very clear that if we would have voted differently, we would have voted ``no.''  It seems to me, from the perspective of Washington, that it was very clear that if you would have voted ``no,'' and you would have voted ``yes,'' and if you would have voted ``yes,'' that would have yielded the most bipartisan bill than that, even if it went the other way.  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the SPEAKER pro tempore. The SPEAKER pro tempore is dedicated to advancing the case of the so-called ``American Dreamment Act.'' The bill seeks to address this very issue through legislation that aims to expand opportunities to create jobs.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S.C. 740.  Senator Hatch is a great leader, a great partner. I thank Senator Hatch.  I want to thank his leadership on this issue. He has been good in our effort to help fund our border security efforts. He has been very good at helping us put together our Homeland Security program which, in his words, provided for some of our major security issues here in this great country. And he has been great in that he was always aware of the need to make sure that our President, his Chief of Staff, the chief of our team, he could have been a member of that program. He knew exactly what it was going to be to put together some of these programs, to try to make sure that we have the security of our border and our economy secure so that we can do that. And we have had a great leader in him. That's what we want to do. It's what we want to do.  He has been a leader that is very successful, and we hope that we will have the opportunity to help him in doing that.  It's really a great honor to be with him and he's very talented. He's very much a good
John Cornyn. Mr. President, what we do know in this body is that we have the most common interest rate of interest rate in the world. Under current international law, we have a cap on interest rates. That is what is needed to move this country forward. But we're not doing this. The real issue is the administration and Chairman Grassley talked to the chairman before the vote on the amendment.  Let me give you a little bit of context. No, I have not taken as much time as I was in my role as an advisor. But the President has said that, in the Senate, I would take the time, and I would say, let it be on the floor, and I would put my time up.  But my point is that it is not the time to put up the time. It's the time to say to the Senator from the States: I rise in support of H.R. 5053.  I rise in support of H.R. 5101.  I rise just a little bit. I am a great leader, and I am proud to be on the other side of this.  I am proud to be on the other side of this. I am a great leader, too.  My life has
Richard Durbin. Madam President, let's get this straight. As I discussed earlier, the IRS is completely out of control, and I know nothing about public policy, and it's not very helpful here. If that's going to be in the headlines, I urge my colleagues to speak out.  I understand the Senator will want to pass this bill, but it is clear that the tax haven will be going through a process of investigation. There is no evidence that they have handled that audit properly. That is exactly where the IRS's focus is on this issue.  The IRS is not going to do a bad thing, and as I said earlier, we do need to address this issue in order to get the tax haven going through, and the IRS can do that. But I would also like to make it clear that this is something that the IRS, the IRS, has done with no regard for the privacy of the people that are still in that office. The question for the rest of us is, Can we do a better job of doing this?  I see the Senator's comments on privacy are deeply moving from this moment; it is an issue that has been raised and debated--is there a way we can do a better job of doing a better
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that some of you are considering this amendment. I did not include this amendment in the House amendment. The gentleman from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who voted against the House amendment, has asked me on the floor to consider his amendment by unanimous consent.  The 
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I have some comments to make here in regard to H.R. 2288, a bill that provides for Medicare benefits for the first year after the end of Federal Medicare, up to December 31.  This is a bill that will increase the minimum age for Medicare to 18.  These are the minimum ages that Medicare is supposed to extend for first year beneficiaries.  The legislation includes many provisions that will make Medicare more available.  These include the requirements of the Public Health and Financial Institutions Reform Commission, which have been made language, at the request of the President, about how Medicare benefits are paid for according to a formula based on the number of children enrolled at the public expense.  That formula is an outdated formula that is not in the law or the law of the land.  This bill could have been voted on. Instead, the President chose to use language that is in the law of his country, and Congress voted on it. Instead of going into this particular provision, I should say something to the point that will add further to the bill.  Aha.  
Joseph Heck. I thank Mr. Conaway. I will finish the speech next.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Speaker Boehner for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. McGovern), an outstanding member of the Congressional Black Caucus.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to my friend from Colorado, the former Chairman of the Committee on Government and Commerce, the ranking member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and a cosponsor of H.R. 576, the ``Red Tape'' legislation.  There being no objection from the minority, the Chair's vote was taken and the vote was ordered.  The Clerk read the title of the amendment.

iter: 200 / 2898
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1510, the Trade Act of 2016.  This bill would put a halt to the free trade of American companies and jobs, and, indeed, it would halt the free trade of small and medium businesses. Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to address the ongoing problems facing American small and medium businesses, the one that's been affecting the American financial sector, and, perhaps most importantly, the American public and the people of this country.  We've seen a number of serious environmental and human rights issues brought to the attention of the Federal Government due to this legislation.  This bill also calls for a massive national credit rating for small businesses, something that will be a huge part of the solution for American workers across the Nation.  The U.S. Small Business Administration's own report, published in September of last year, shows that the current Federal credit rating agencies for small companies have been unable to successfully meet their own obligations to protect the interests of the American people.  This bill was written to reduce the financial stress experienced by American small and medium businesses.  Under this bill, small and medium companies would have to sell their products to American consumers in low- and middle-income countries

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, just yesterday the Democratic Senator from Texas came away with their most important moment, the fact that she was able to take the lead on her Republican counterpart's motion to defund American schools.  I wish that this bill would take the lead in getting this to the floor and come back up and say that I support this very bill even though this might mean more money for our schools.  I know I have been asking for answers and I do not feel that I am qualified to answer them. But as a Senator from the Republican Party and a fellow who is running for office, that is what I am trying to do.  You know that this is truly a time to put the brakes on this.  There are a lot of people who are out with, in fact, a little bit of a problem on the other side if you go and see what the problem is exactly, and I have been, I have had lots of, you know, discussion with some colleagues about this issue. And one of my concerns is some of us have been voting on a bill which is a good bill. It is a good bill as to some of the things that are going on in the country.  I have a bill at this moment in terms
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take up the issue of what constitutes a proper tax assessment.  The gentleman from California would be right. But, as the gentleman from California points out in his letter, there are tax considerations to be considered under this bill. It is my understanding that one of those tax considerations is tax costs. If you are a Member of the House of Representatives, the cost of tax is very, very high. I have a simple answer for that: what is really a tax is a tax cost. That is the tax that is at the risk of your life.  If it is a tax cost, that is fine, but if it is a tax charge, that is something that a Member of the House must take account of for that. That does not include the costs to the taxpayer of the purchase of a vehicle or a vehicle hire. And it is fine. Those are the costs, if the gentleman would like to take it away.  But, if it is a tax cost, the gentleman from California would certainly take them away and do a little bit of a different thing. So the gentleman from California would take action.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, we don't need to spend time and effort lobbying here with the Democratic Party to pass this bill.  We want to work with those who are against it, and this bill is a little bit of a stretch for some folks. We're just looking for a loophole, and I'm talking about some loophole here. I think we could get the amendment.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume to the good men and women who are going to be here.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I will not be able to address how the House will be represented in the coming days and months.  I will be here with the committee to respond to my amendment and explain my amendment and I will try to answer my committee.  I have had some amendments that have been added to the amendment. That is because I am also opposed to the previous amendment. The House had about 2 weeks to respond to the amendment. That does not mean we are going to have to respond. Instead, as a rule, every member makes a point of objection.  I will not be able to do anything to discuss today's amendment of the rule.  I will be here with the majority.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. I am a member.  The first thing I have to do before I sit here is talk about this.  I have been here with my friends for a long time. Let's talk about our political life here today. I was born in the district of Belgrade, Yugoslavia and have come over here over here in my first year as a member. It was a place where I had roots, my family and friends.  I grew up in one of the old areas in central Serbia. I was a young farmer. My family was from Belgrade, and my home was in Belgrade. I was in one of our places because of that. It was the first place that I came to in my very first year. I had just learned to farm. There were only six of us. The farm was not known by the people we were talking about. I told my friends and my friends what we were going to do.  I am going to explain to them something, but first, I feel a little bit embarrassed with saying this, that the way I am talking.  I have been in my homeland for more than one year now. I have been there for 4 years. I feel that these people have been there because

Harry Reid. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to floor debate only on nominations for the Office of the Secretary of Commerce.  
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 1671, the ``Medicare for American Victims of Government Abuse,'' to promote the Medicare Advantage program in Massachusetts.  The goal of the legislation is to allow health care providers to more easily obtain access to affordable Medicaid insurance, in order to ensure that the American people will have access to the benefits they need.  The bill's goals are to expand access and affordability, to ensure that health insurance plans are able to offer health coverage that they can afford. As promised earlier this year, the legislation will help millions of Americans with health insurance coverage, with the goal of ensuring that they are not forced out of their homes by government or the government's government.  This is a bipartisan legislation that we strongly support. It is also one to have the backing of the House of Representatives on the House of Representatives' side.  The legislation also includes a provision that would help prevent those who are not covered by current limits to file an application to be covered by other plans and so that the government will be able to choose to offer affordable insurance.  This will help protect people who are not covered by current plans. Providing access to affordable insurance through this legislation will hopefully improve
Richard Durbin. I thank the distinguished chairman for his important statement.  Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking my chairman for his important work in the environment and in protecting our Nation's environment. I have long been a cosponsor of the Climate Risk, which is the bipartisan task of managing the global climate emergency.  I would like to thank the distinguished chair of the Federal energy commission for her clear, comprehensive approach to the task. She has been a steadfast advocate for the global economy and the environment.  I am happy to be recognized for the extraordinary work she has done to restore public investment during the financial crisis. It is now well documented. Indeed, I applaud her progress in these areas.  I want to thank the gentlewoman from California and the distinguished ranking member of the Federal Energy and Water Committee, Senator Murray, for their excellent work on this issue. It is especially important for our Nation to be a strong place for the work of energy, water and energy systems and for communities across the country.  I would like to thank my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Mikulski, who has been a champion of the environment, including energy development. He is also one of the most critical leaders we have ever have.  I want to commend

Joseph Heck. Mr. President, I rise today to voice concerns about the State of the Union on the part of the Senator from California. A number of issues remain that Republicans would like to focus on, including: the ongoing investigation of President Trump, the new Republican majority in the Senate, and whether it is necessary reauthorizing the Department of Homeland Security, which is the primary tool that the Senate could use to further investigate President Trump and could be used to stop his political agenda.  The Democrats are worried about the White House. They see the White House as more open to a Trump administration than the Republican leadership does. I strongly believe that we should not be surprised to see the Republican minority in the Senate doing things to stifle the growth of American democracy.  The President is already working on these issues, and we have to see how it impacts our national security.  We have seen firsthand the damage done by the Iran nuclear deal, but we need to do more to make sure this deals are successful.  So, in order to address this, I would ask Senator Johnson to call up amendments that would prohibit the use of force against Iran, and to try and protect our borders from Iran's nuclear weapons.  As I am sure the President and Congress can work together

Harry Reid. Madam President, I would just like to make a point of emphasis on my remarks, and I will make a point of emphasis when I talk about H.R. 467.  Now, if there were four Senators voting on the motion to proceed, I would send it to the Senate, but it is not going to happen.  The ACTING PRESIDENT.  The 
John Cornyn. Mr. President, on this issue I do want to talk to a number of people who are not going to pass this amendment. These are very high-level folks who have a great sense that they are being sent to this. They will be sent to the Department of Veteran Affairs, but this would not apply to them.  Mr. President, we must now move along the lines of this amendment, and I want to talk from a point of order. I am a friend of the Veterans' Administration, and when I was a senior vice president before becoming general counsel and then as the secretary of defense, we were told that senior advisers wouldn't be allowed to speak about this amendment. I wanted to bring it up because I think we're going to be very close by this point because of that amendment. I think we have to be a little bit of a partisan minority to be a little bit of a majority to be a majority to make sure there are some amendments that would be brought down.  Our time is right now, but if we don't do this, we can have the same number of amendments that were in the bill that were in this legislation.  In addition this amendment would provide a means for the Secretary of State to develop a process

Neil Abercrombie.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. Horseshoe's amendment to provide for the minimum wage in this State.  The minimum wage in this State is $7.00 for every worker. These workers have the highest hourly pay at the desk in Kansas.  Every day, more and more people go hungry and die in this country than any other country in the world.  Let me remind you, we are all Americans and we get sick and die because of this and because of this and because of this.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation, and I will urge my colleagues to support this amendment if the House of Representatives adjourned on Monday morning for debate on the floor.  The amendment is intended to amend section 542 of Health and Human Services Act of 1989 to require that the President, the Chief Health Physician, and Federal partners be paid as compensation for the time of their employment for the following periods of time--eighteen months, 30 months, 6 years, 3 years, 4 years.

Joseph Heck. At the same time, I am here speaking in a bipartisan way about the bill that is really bipartisan on the health care side. It is a bill that is a lot broader than the bill that is in the bill and it is a lot more broadly. It is going to strengthen our government and make us stronger and that is going to be a big part of what is going to take our economy. We have many things that are important to us as a country. We are talking about a lot of things that our people, whether they are young people, whether they are in our country, whether they are in our communities or whether they are here in the States of our country, whether they have been here in the States of our country. So we are talking about some of the things that need to happen and some of the things that are critical to addressing this for people of other parts of this country. I am not here talking about the bills that are in this bill alone. I am talking about a bill that is in this bill alone.  It is, again, a bipartisan bill and I think it is in the bill alone.  Right now, in the bill that I am going to today, Republicans have made the right choice for us. It is

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance of a bipartisan tax reform bill for America, America First, with the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate today. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon, our friend and a strong voice in this issue of fiscal responsibility.  The President of the United States.  I am in strong opposition to this bipartisan effort by the Republican majority, which is divided into two parts: the Tax Code, which includes the three-part structure of tax and spending legislation that was adopted in the last Congress, and a tax-hike extension that would tax the millions of Americans who are making use of these technologies.  I have spoken a little bit about the importance of the Tax Code and the tax extension because of the strong support for the Tax Code by the majority of the Senate. It provides flexibility to the new administration and makes sure that new funds are created to help keep our country on line, improve fiscal discipline and strengthen our institutions, especially for those of us in Washington who are in a position to move forward with the tax extension bill.  The Tax Code is not a bill to spend an unlimited amount of tax money. But it will reduce the average pay of our workers by 60 percent. We
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I rise in favor of S. Res. 1391, that of the Veterans Rights Restoration Program. The legislation seeks to protect the interests of the Veterans during the war in the United States in the Republic of Vietnam. The program was introduced by Representative Chris Van Hollen. It was signed into law in January of 1995 and has been running ever since. Veterans and citizens have a right to be heard and our government.  I want to thank Representative Van Hollen for his leadership on this important piece of legislation. I thank him again. We have a strong sense of duty on behalf of all.  I would like to address the concerns of the minority community members in my district. I am proud to call up to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee the Subcommittee on Veterans' Rights.  Let's not forget that there has been controversy here for nearly four years. At a time when the Veterans are losing their freedoms, as the veteran world continues to unravel, this legislation will be a major piece of legislation.  I am very proud of Representative Van Hollen's leadership on this effort. I am hopeful he will join it.  I am very, very proud about this bill as well. We must make sure that this does not happen again
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, today I rise in support of H.R. 2520, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 to ensure that all members of Congress know that their Senators work together to advance defense and reduce the fiscal cost on the defense of our country.  As we continue to fight for a tax breaks under which our American citizens are eligible to keep their government solvent, we must realize that while it is important to ensure the American people enjoy the highest tax rates on their income, that America's tax breaks do pay for themselves.  Under these tax breaks, Congress and the President are paying $300 billion in taxes every year. Today, this tax break could be viewed as a financial victory for our country. For example, the President's decision to reduce the Department of Defense's $11 billion military-to-information tax break in September was a decisive step in reducing the deficit by another $1.5 billion. I yield the President 4 minutes.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, this legislation is very good for us as the ranking member and a leader in both the Federal and State governments in the United States.  I thank Senator Whitehouse for his leadership on this bill. I yield the floor.

Joseph Heck. I rise today with my distinguished colleague, Senator Kaine, along with a number of other Members of the Ways and Means Committee. I first learned of the importance of health insurance in the wake of the 2008 health reform law. I first learned of the importance of insurance in my home State of Wisconsin, and I understand every single State has an insurance company that provides insurance under Medicare. I can tell you that this legislation has been a major success in the States, and they have a lot of promise. It has had a long, long list of successes, but in the wake of the 2008 health reform law and the Democratic takeover and the Democrats' attack on Medicare, I had the privilege of representing my State and the States in this Senate.  Mr. Kaine, I have been one of the few Representatives with firsthand experience in any Senate matter. I have worked with him on behalf of seniors in his State and on behalf of the States of Wisconsin and Illinois. I have been fortunate enough to represent our country and have worked with him on behalf of constituents, small business owners and farmers across the country. With health insurance, our health care costs are lower than that of every other State. The Democratic takeover of Medicare, and the Democrats' attack on Medicare, has caused us

I know I hear a lot of people say, ``We have to take a little water away from that and turn it into something new.'' That is something we are working to do. And this bill will be a huge boost for the American people. It will create jobs for everyone, including those who need electricity. It will help people to find jobs, to find better jobs, to help pay their bills. It will give Americans confidence in their ability to succeed. It will make sure that what is needed for energy is energy that is natural, simple and reliable.  I encourage our Senators to vote.

Known for his leadership in the Army, O'Keefe served the best and safest of all time by leading a brigade to World War II veteran's units in Panama, Uruguay, Haiti, and the United States of America. He was also a cosponsor of H.R. 37, a bipartisan appropriations and aid bill that passed the House in 1996.  He is survived by his wife of 49 years, his daughter, his son, David Aderholt and his wife of 39 years, and six grandchildren.

It is a pleasure to thank him for his comments on an earlier article about a project I was working on, and we are not alone in this. For many, the project is critical, but I think the other thing we need to talk about is the problem of how to deal with the problems of climate change.  Many of us are concerned about climate change. Climate change is one of the main reasons for our decision to go into a large military base and put ourselves back in the situation we were in at the time. Most people don't know that the United States can fight climate change. They don't know how. They don't know how to deal with it. They don't know how to deal with this problem.  I have had conversations about the other issues around climate change. We have had very different discussions in the last year--we have been on a scientific expedition--and we are going to end up with a lot of questions.

It is time to recognize that it is an important day that Congress should take into consideration. In addition to the strong, bipartisan support that we had with the Senate and the rest of the body, the Republicans' failure to do any good to address what Republicans have said is one of the largest problems we have felt in our Senate since that first meeting in May. A lot of the pain has come with us from the Republican leadership. First, they have held hearings yesterday to try to find out if we can do any good to address it. I hope that somehow they will find out that this is not our fault. That is not our fault. That is why our Senator from Tennessee has been called the hardest person to find in terms of leadership. They said it is time for Congress to finish the work that we are doing to address what Republicans are saying is a crisis. This is not our problem. This is not our problem. Because it is not our fault. It is not our fault. It is a crisis.  We have to move forward. I do not think we need to move forward today, or I think our Senate is moving.  We have

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the two of us on this floor. We are talking about the Supreme Court's jurisdiction over the States, over the Federal courts, through which Congress took away the powers granted to it by statute.  The United States Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed that it is in a sense constitutional if it has a say in deciding what is in a State's case in courts of law.  As I said in my remarks, the Supreme Court has never said that the Constitution, which has been in force, does not have the authority for adjudication in a State's case in court. It has been in force through other States and under other circumstances, when the Supreme Court has stated that the Supreme Court has the authority to decide the rights of all States which are under the Constitution.  This is a constitutional amendment, a vote of no confidence.  I object to the amendment.  The vote was taken by a margin of only 2-2.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Dr. Kevin Casey for receiving the American Association for Clinical Sciences' Early Research Award for his research on the application of digital learning in the management of sleep disorders. Dr. Casey's work has been of the highest quality, from both experimental and epidemiologic. In clinical practice across the United States, electronic devices have made progress in a number of areas of science and technology that have already demonstrated successful treatments. The majority of the research conducted by Dr. Casey was peer reviewed, but the research of electronic devices is still well over half of what is described in peer reviewed studies.  In the past, medical journals published papers that were peer reviewed, but were not published in full-text on peer reviewed articles.  It is particularly important to us as a physician, because that provides an opportunity to provide an understanding of how this technology can be applied across the medical system to address a wide range of clinical issues that are often under-reported and challenging to diagnose.  The use of digital learning devices for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders is yet another area of research that has already shown the significant impact of using digital learning devices for the management of these severe conditions. That, and the many other areas, have

What we did was roll back the Affordable Care Act which, as has been pointed out, the Congress didn't have a law that would go through Congress.  If this is the only bill in the bill that that will put an end to the Affordable Care Act, then we do want to look at other measures that are in the bill that have been in the bill that would repeal it. I think that's where we'll start getting into the details.  What I want to do is I want our Members and I want to start talking about how to stop repealing or not repealing something that is a very important piece of the bill. This is a bill that was in the House last year. We have, I think, three bills that have appeared in that Senate--two of them are in the House and two of them in the Senate. You don't hear a lot of comments about that in the Senate, and it's still a little bit of a debate.

Richard Durbin. Mr. Speaker, today I wish to speak about the importance of working with the Department of Veterans Affairs under the provisions of rule No. 615 as a way to better support veterans of all ages. I am proud to say I still have more than a dozen veterans that have served their country with the VA, but when the VA is able to do so it increases our support for veterans in need.  I have had many veterans talk about the importance of working with the VA of working with the Department of Veterans Affairs. I have spoken to many veterans, about the importance of working with the Department of Veterans Affairs, as I said earlier, to help those who are struggling to find the best home they can have.  As I explained earlier, the Veterans Service Agency in the last several years has a tradition when it comes to dealing with veterans coming to their home to make ends meet, the VA-wide. Most veterans come to their own VA home and are given a period of time to get to know, in order, those who are in need of service. So, to say that all who may be of the veteran group have had many, many hours of that work, who could actually have been able to have had the best service they could receive
Neil Abercrombie. I would also like to take a moment to say to the American people, the following amendment comes from the House of Representatives.  If this amendment were printed in the Record, the House would have one chance to pass over the bill, which will require a third reading amendment. But we now have a question that goes to the Senate. Is there any objection I might have to the House?  If there was objection, I think I would yield the floor.  
Travis Childers. Madam Chair, I rise today to address the Senate's very real opportunity to overturn the Affordable Care Act.  The Act allows the Department of Health and Human Services to designate a certain number of new medical facilities to help improve health care for millions of Americans.  The Affordable Care Act allows the Department of Health and Human Services to designate medical and surgical facilities that are located in low-income populations, to provide temporary and permanent care for the uninsured, and to reduce the costs of insurance.  This bill was signed into law by Senator Paul Durbin in January 2010 and was introduced in the Senate by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Udall).  On October 3, 2010, Congressman John Sarbanes of Ohio signed the legislation, and Senator Udall has joined him in introducing it.  This bill was introduced by Senator John McCain and Senator Paul Durbin. It is the first time that Senator McCain and Senator Durbin have come together to advance the goal to prohibit ObamaCare from being repealed.  This bill is a major victory for the Republican Party that has seen its support increase every year.  The Republican Party's overwhelming support for ObamaCare has given us the opportunity to do away with its long history of opposing the Affordable Care Act.
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, as you know I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I know that I am unavoidably delayed. It is with great pride that I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I join my colleagues in wishing that we all had the opportunity to vote on a bill that we will call ``Medicaid for All.'' But there is no substitute for a bill that deals specifically with the topic of Medicaid, and I do not want to add to that. There is a clear difference between what we are fighting on the one hand and what we are fighting on the other. There is a difference between the two; and I hope we can agree to do the same.  The House and Senate have been listening to each and every single one of our colleagues. They both know that each will be fighting against the other in the same way.  We have worked in the past, in the effort to craft a plan that would make sure that the two bills are balanced, and we can agree. But we can't agree to that. We have spoken about that issue in the debate in Congress. We can't agree to that.  In my opinion it is not fair because now is the time to talk about a
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  There were eight Republican Members of the House, and I was here, but you don't get to vote for the people who have been elected to serve under my name. The House of Representatives was a place where all kinds of ideas were created and that was that. The Speaker did something on his own--I voted.  I have to say that the Democrat leadership did not try to put any efforts on the side of the people. They tried to hold all Republicans together.  If we had a group of Republicans with a lot of ideas, but very different opinions, that we could have the same vote on the bill, would we have to have a vote on the bill?  So it is my intention to tell you the vote was not taken; I wish you all a very good vote on the bill, and I thank you for your support.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I know of no other leader for whom this is my opportunity to address the urgent issue of energy security.  The President's energy policy has been, and remains, in the majority position in a national energy security strategy.  This is a difficult policy to follow.  The President's strategy reflects his view of energy security.  The President's energy strategy offers an opportunity to expand and implement the State of the Union, which includes the Energy Development, Recovery and Implements Act and Executive Order.  This plan embodies the President's strong commitment to energy security. With this new energy strategy, an increase in domestic production and an increase in the investment of America's energy markets, the President will expand his energy policy.  This will increase the American energy security.  As President Bush proclaimed, ``America will live in a new world.'' The President's Energy Policy will continue to support America's need for energy.  In the year of his inauguration, President Bush has promised to spend more than 10 years ensuring an energy security. It is the only way to address energy security. At that time, President Bush promised to spend 10 years to ensure that America's energy security will be ensured. He has failed and will not return.  So
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, with a healthy bill of rights, this Congress should be able to protect what we think is our best hope for preserving the status quo. This is a time when the Federal Government would be able to protect the rule of law by giving billions in discretionary funds to the Department of Homeland Security before we go to court or for a lawsuit or for the government or the private sector to pay for the costs of providing relief, for public sector, for the economy, a little while after that or before that.  
Neil Abercrombie. But now, we have a new law requiring all Americans to pay taxes on their own spending.  We can't do this. We have to work together, and we have to work together to get to the tax floor.  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Andrews).  
Travis Childers. Will you have an excuse for not having dinner today? If so, I ask my friend from the airport to please excuse me.  I would like to respond to his offer.  I have a question. Will there be any comments when an airplane lands?  I have an airplane, and my colleague and I are both sitting on the floor.  But I think he would have to say yes. We have a good discussion on the economy.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for a bill that would provide money for the U.S. Navy to be collected from military retirees and servicemembers for tax incentives.  As my colleague, Congressman Barrasso of California, is said to have supported this legislation, we need to be able to track this money across the board with taxpayer dollars.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a very interesting article in the Record for the first time in years that is devoted to finding ways to keep the Federal government going, including a rule forcing companies to hire new employees who they didn't have when they weren't employed.  It is not only in the House of Representatives, it is important to remind our constituents that only the Department of Labor can make it illegal. So if you ask anybody in the office of the Federal Government, what the Department of Labor puts in the regulations, the regulations that govern how the government can hire and keep the Federal Government going, how much money people pay for their labor, you know what they are talking about?  So the Department of Labor's regulation is about making sure that they have the best possible opportunity for folks to hire new employees.  But what we've talked about before is that this regulation does not make sense to any individual who has had to make a decision on whether to leave the workplace or hire.  So what this regulation means and what this regulation hasn't, I think is an important piece of legislation that makes sense for what the Department of Labor does.  Mr. Speaker, that regulation puts the burden on the employer the

I am so grateful for the opportunity to continue the work of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Duffy), and a great deal of hard work is in order. There is something I am privileged to be able to say about the fact that Mr. Duffy, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, is extremely dedicated to the Homeland Security Act of 2009. I wish to say that I am honored to hear a very different story about the fact that Mr. Duffy, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has a great deal of commitment to the security of the United States of America.  He talks a lot about the fact that this is the first time America ever lost the war to Ukraine, and the fact that he was elected to have the freedom to use your government as his personal spokesman just to stand up for the Constitution.  He talks about the fact that he and his wife, Sandra and I don't even think that he would necessarily say it. We are not talking about that. He talks about the fact that we should do this legislation now, in which the President has put in place an act of government which does

Mr. Chair, to this end I demand that the Chairman read the bill I offered to the Committee on Environment, Public Works, and Transportation and to the Journal of the Committee on Agriculture, Public Works, and Nutrition Committee Report No. 101-22.  This bill is the first in a series of bills to accompany the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Campaign Act. It is also the fourth in a series of bills introduced by the Environmental Protection Agency that have taken the lead in my State, and has the support of an estimated 20,000 scientists, experts, and educators from across the country.  In just a few months, I have seen action on the bill from many of the concerned citizens, from public utilities across Georgia to conservation organizations across the country. They have seen it.  With my commitment to the House of Representatives, I would like to commend the Environment Committee for their ability to take this country's Environmental Protection Agency program and to look at how this has impacted the American public.  In my time, I will be joined by Senator Hatch, chairman of the Environmental Protection and Nuclear Regulatory Subcommittee, and Congressman Bass, the other voice of

After all, my colleague on the Senator from Maryland has been confirmed this spring, but as this Senate confirmation process continues, we are still looking at the potential for the President's nomination, and on that is a strong point that we need to make sure that we don't overdo ourselves.  That is why I'm here today and why I yield back my customary amendment. As we are getting ready for the day, I ask for the gentlelady to yield back the balance of her time.  Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to have the gentlelady yield back the balance of her time. That is a very high value for my office, and I want to honor it, especially as we were having a hearing on the nomination.

It is with great pride that I rise to recognize the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine) and Senator Mark Warner, President Obama, for passing the VA's Medicare Advantage program.  I am very proud that, in 2013, the VA became the largest employer in the State (or the largest employer in my district) by providing over 35 million new jobs for Medicare Advantage. Today, by passing Medicare Advantage, they are the most important employer in my county and the least important employer in my district.  It is good to remember that we are at the crossroads of the health care reform movement, and I am proud to be on the front lines of that.  It is important to recognize the successes we have achieved, and we should be proud to be here today to stand for these successes.  I just want to thank all of you for helping to bring Medicare Advantage to the States, and I thank all of you for being a part of that.  Here is what we are doing over the last couple of years: We are creating new workforce for Medicare Advantage, and we are creating new employees for States and local governments and State and local
Harry Reid. Mr. President, as you will see, the Republican Party is more than two weeks away from the 2016 election. It is already in the Senate. It is in charge in the House, with the majority leader and the majority leader in charge of things like Medicare. We have to put the focus and the policy of this Chamber to make sure that, because they are the Republicans, the law should have been laid out and the House should have laid out what they and the majority leader should be doing.  The Democratic--and this is the only way I can rule with certainty the House--has laid out what they should be doing, but it is not going to be done in the way in which they are doing it. I am going to let the minority leader know and the majority leader know, but no Republican should ever have to do everything that the minority cannot do, except to be recognized as a constituent or as a leader. There is no way out of that that we are going to be all here on the floor. And the rule is very simple. I will tell you, I have a rule. It is very simple. But I have put it in here with the Republican Party.  As soon as you have somebody like this, you will have

I also want to thank for all of the speakers who brought great ideas and ideas forward and on both sides of the aisle that I will now be giving an opportunity to give back.  At the heart of what is happening in this body are the fiscal policies that are being put in place. In the last 2 years, we have seen an unprecedented increase in debt. That is not a new problem but if we continue to take in the debt, we will just end up with more debt. In addition, the debt is not just at a time that the government keeps going down in size, it is now at a time of crisis. Today, more than 25 countries and even more than 1,500 countries in the world are under the debt-ceiling, debt-ceiling system.  At

We're going to start by putting together a list of the most important programs that are going to be in the budget for this year. I want to talk a little bit about the overall direction of the budget. I think Mr. Whitehouse is doing a good job. But just a couple of things that I don't like about the administration, I don't like about our economy, we need a robust government, that I don't think we need a balanced budget.  Let's look at the economy. That's a very good economic statement. We need a robust economy. We need a robust health care system. We are going to have to keep the spending rate down and keep the deficit down.  Let's look at the deficit. The deficit is a good thing. But it is also a real problem. We have now lost $1 trillion for tax cuts. We need to end Medicare, and we need to balance $1 trillion. We have a long list of budget proposals that we could have done without the deficit. But you have to look at the fact that we know that we have a balanced budget.
Neil Abercrombie. As a matter of practice, the President has been talking with the Congress and the Senate on the issue of trade, and we have been able to move the House a little over a month.  The House has not decided yet how to rule on this and has not decided on a bill that deals with that.  The Senate has not made any decision or offered any action-made amendments as to trade.  The House has been very conservative, and I will say that we have been supportive of a bill that deals with the trade bill.  The trade bill is being debated tonight and I would say that this trade bill should be considered a measure that could have the same weight as the Trade Price Modernization Committee.  The trade bill provides for a rule to be followed if the price increases for the goods are not controlled by the Trade Price Administration of the United States. The Trade Price Administration has not been consulted about a trade bill because it would allow the Secretary of Commerce to regulate that process. It has not been consulted.  The Senate has not taken up the bill to the House.  It has not been asked to vote on it. It has been brought to the floor.  The House has not decided. It has made no decision or

He is here to introduce something important to pass this bill. He has a good legislative record on this bill. But, he has an issue that we cannot put this legislation for yet without passing the bill on the floor of the Senate, and I think there is a bill he can put out that would protect this legislation. I would like to thank Mr. Doh for his leadership on this bill. Unfortunately, the bill hasn't passed in a couple hours when we are back at the Capitol for the vote. I think this bill will be the focus of all House Members' actions this evening.

First, I wish to remind my colleagues that our goal is the same: achieve the status quo that we believe is unsustainable, a failure of self-determination and the pursuit of a political, territorial, and ethnic identity.  Now, this could be the next step in this plan that confronts us with the issue of our Nation and our homeland. It is in fact my view and intention that this new order be a failure of self-determination.  It is our expectation that our Nation's values and interests are protected--and more importantly, it is at stake. In a word: It is to be a failure of self-determination--a failure of the pursuit of a political, territorial, and ethnic identity.  This plan, which was made and announced in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be taken as seriously as possible. It is not an exaggeration to say that the President was determined to take the plan as seriously as possible.

Harry Reid. I appreciate the remarks.  Madam President, I rise today on behalf of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. President Obama's budget, which the Democratic leader promised will cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion, has been reported back to the Senate by the other side of the aisle, the President's budget. A report the Senate passed earlier this year by the same Democrat Democrat committee said we will cut $1.4 trillion in deficit by 2010, or $1.7 trillion. This report, which we will have in our morning business, is a rough copy of a report the Senate passed earlier this year, dated earlier this week, which, it says, is intended to help the economy improve and grow the deficit.  The committee report did not even come before the Senate's own committee so we do not have access to that.  When the American people had a budget before the Senate, the American people held it in an attempt to make sure that it would not fail. Before the budget was passed, the Republicans did not hold it in an effort to meet what they called the ``increasy'' deficit. We went into the budget to make sure that it would go up, but it didn't. It became a
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from Oklahoma and his wife from New Jersey.  The reason I do not want to come in now is because of the fact there is no such thing as a filibuster. The Senator from Illinois understands the issue on the floor as an issue that comes up.  The Senator from Missouri understands the issue on the floor as an issue that comes up.  Now, we are going to have to come up with some bills that are very simple and very easy to comprehend.  The Senator from Missouri says that his plan to veto the Hyde amendment, and he goes on to say that he has no doubt that the government will give us a veto on it as well.  We know on the House side, I have said that in the previous legislative session, if the government says ``no,'' then that means we have got to use those government veto machines.  Now, what we heard from the Senate side and the House side was that the government would not just use their veto machines but would have to use their veto devices that were just on the surface of what we were saying that they would not.  We heard Senator Reid tell his Republican friends in Congress that this is not a veto. He was talking about his amendment
Richard Durbin. I would just like to point out that we're not going to allow the Obama administration and the Republicans on the other side of the aisle to go through their procedural rules that we're going to allow any Federal agencies to do in the future--the Department of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland Security, DHS, DHS, and Customs--any Federal agencies, whether they're Federal or State, whether they're Federal or State Government, whether they're Federal or State Government, whether they're Federal or State Government.  So if you're going to go through that, you're going to have that rule made out of a procedural process that you're going to have. And that is the problem with this administration, in my view, if you look at the process that we're going to have in place, and I think we all know the Obama administration has the ability to have that procedural rules.  So I yield the amendment. I would say this is unfortunate, but I think we ought to be able to proceed to debate this on this motion.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, in September, I heard a young lady talk briefly about whether we should make a budget on the national debt.  
Travis Childers. Let me say this in a bipartisan way: Let me say that we have worked with our friend Senator Schumer, and we know that he is the best person to come to this Chamber and help us get the job done. I am glad that he is here.  I think it is a wise choice to join our Senator from North Carolina this week to come out and get some votes. But I think the time this Republican leader has to go through this and get back to working with him.

Mitch McConnell. You are absolutely correct. It was my understanding that this deal went into effect right around the time the House held an emergency vote on H.J. Res. 18, H.R. 4741.  With this bill here in the bill in the bill, you cannot put it back on the floor. You cannot put it back on the floor.  No, I am not suggesting that the House will be forced to accept it. I oppose that. I oppose the bill. I am not arguing with the Republican leadership that we cannot take away the Senate's ability to stand up to the majority and to allow itself to be held up as much as we can--which we did in a long time. We have been through many times where that is not the case. I am not suggesting that this House would be forced to take it off the floor. But the fact of the matter is, if this bill is offered at the first reading and the conference committee has a majority, it should be agreed to.  I agree. The House will be constrained from taking this matter off the floor. They will not have the authority to do so. We will not have the opportunity to do it.
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 55.  The 
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I have an amendment. As I noted, the Senator from California has opposed the amendment and has asked the House to do its due diligence in this week.  The gentleman from Nebraska was a friend of Congressman Tom Udall and has been my friend and the ranking member of the House Rules Committee. I will be happy to work with him and his colleagues on this matter.  
Richard Durbin. I would like to move this motion, which is in the Record, to strike the time for consideration of the motion to strike.

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stop Smoking and Illicit Drug Act, S. 1185. This legislation would ban the use of the opioid fentanyl to deal with the addictive nature of the drug, which is commonly referred to as a "smoldering heroin" because of the fear associated with the use. This legislation would allow an individual to have a controlled substance taken from them in order to get a job on the street, and the legislation would also ban the use of other opioids like marijuana.  Mr. Speaker, we have seen a lot of progress on these very important issues where we have seen a lot of unintended consequences from using opioids like fentanyl to treat addiction. As my colleague from California has pointed out, the most significant was the fentanyl overdose that occurred in the 1980s, with the result that people suffered terrible pain after use and often received a death sentence. We need to look out for the other dangers associated with using a drug like fentanyl. We need to stop using opioids and get us on the same page on the issue of taking opioids with our children.  I hope we can all work together in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill I introduced, Stop Tobacco Addiction Act
Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I want to thank all of you for giving us the time to consider this legislation and I look forward to your continuing efforts in this important role and to my continued work in the House of Representatives.  I rise in support of this legislation because it is the first of its kind in the Nation. I applaud the House for passing this bill today, and I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for giving it another chance to get better and for bringing this legislation to the floor for a vote. I want to recognize those hard workers and their families who are struggling while working in this environment, and I want to thank the staff of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs--this Committee, this subcommittee and my committee chair--for their contributions to this legislation.  Thanks to my staff, Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein, and my family, I can join us in this bipartisan effort to make America's energy and climate energy resources more competitive for Americans, and I want all of you to join us in doing so.  Let's talk about that, and it's a good thing. Let's talk about this legislation, which I now want to call the Green Climate Act.  I urge my friends, as a former National
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of this measure.  As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Obama has served to promote and support our troops in Afghanistan.  I know the President's actions in our war with Iraq have been an important part of the success of the Department of Defense, and I support the President's continued efforts on every front.  I know the history of the war and the results that were achieved. While my thoughts and my vision for this House are clear, it is very fitting that they have a chance to come up with a package that is able to meet our objectives and to help us achieve the strategic objectives of the war without putting our best interests in jeopardy.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to recognize the American people and our brave men and women who have been brave men and women on the battlefield and in service.  I am proud to recognize the sacrifices of our men and women on the battlefield during this crisis in Iraq.  This bipartisan measure will ensure that the military in Iraq and Afghanistan can continue their fight with the best and brightest warriors and their families, from our front lines, and we will be able to continue to make important improvements to the battlefield.

At the time of passage, the bill was in the committee room. The bill was reported out for consideration.
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise this evening to offer a few thoughts on this nomination to the U.S. Senate.  A little more than 30 minutes ago, Senator McCain--and then former President Ronald Wicker on this issue--announced that there would be a hearing on the nomination of Mr. Smith, who is not necessarily a person who is a member of the Presidential Council of Economic Advisers, to sit on the Senate Budget Committee.  Just over a year ago, Senator McCain joined many bipartisan groups, including the Natural Environment, the Commerce, Labor, and Education Committee, to support the nomination of a Senator from Idaho.  The most significant leader to this nomination would be Senator Grassley. In fact, Senator Grassley, who has spent 10 weeks on this issue of the Banking and Housing Subcommittee, has been an exemplary leader for her work and for the many hearings that have followed her.  In her speeches to the Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley gave very clear, clear arguments about the need of the U.S. government to make the Federal Government more competitive and more responsive to the American people. In her speeches, Senator Grassley has said that we must do more to make sure that the Federal Government is going to become more competitive, more responsive,
Neil Abercrombie, the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, would have the opportunity to speak on the issue of nationalizing the Department of Homeland Security.  The committee considers extraneous material in the Record, as well as the proceedings on the motion to expedite the proceedings before the Supreme Court.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, on Thursday I went to the Senate Chamber, and was greeted with a cocked hat from a cosponsory committee, and then it wasn't.  I want to say to my colleagues here on the floor, I hope they all understand what has happened and what should not happen.  I thank my colleague, Mr. Schumer, and the majority of the other minority on the Senate floor, Senator Reid. I have listened to his comments. I did not agree with him, and I thank my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  I have spoken to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle at this very moment who are on my side and on the other side of the aisle on my side of the aisle. We have talked about this situation. We have all of us now where we have got to sit together and have heard everything the Senator has said.  I hope he is right. I hope he understands the situation with my colleagues from across the aisle and this morning that we have a lot of things on both sides of the aisle that he can see in the very beginning. I hope we can work together.  I have also spoken to Senator Corker and Senator Schumer, and of course I am one of
Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I yield myself so as not to interrupt a leader from Montana, Mr. Thompson, who is leading this motion.  First of all, we are at this point in time because there is a lot of discussion at the level of the debate that we are looking at here. We are looking at a group of Senators who have worked with Republicans and Democrats to work with us on the bill that they have introduced that would actually do the job that we are trying to do here in Montana.  But we are at this point of time because the bill that we are trying to do here today would be going to be going to the Senate.  So the debate is going to be over a whole package of things.  One of the things we have said is this bill, the bill that we are talking about, we are talking about, I think, is the issue of jobs.  We need a budget, we are talking about a budget and this would be a budget. It is this bill, this bill, this bill, I think, that would just come out that if the national average unemployment rate was a little higher, at this point of time, it would be good for jobs.

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I thank my Senator from Kentucky for her work on this report.  I will yield the floor for the remainder of the debate.  Mr. President, following Senator Alexander's remarks about the Keystone Pipeline, the administration would be responsible for ensuring that we did so without additional costs.  First of all, the administration said that this is a dangerous pipeline. It's dangerous because of the oil. The oil is the only part of our economy that doesn't have enough oil to drive a truck to the finish line, so this isn't something you can blame it on for jobs.  I believe we are in an election year. I am so glad that we have the oil and jobs, but this is an opportunity to put our economy back on pace and bring jobs back to the Nation. But I would say that this is not a pipeline for Congress.  Second, the Energy and Commerce Committee is the body that will decide the allocation of tax breaks for the transportation system while the President does the things he can do to provide certainty and transparency to American workers, the people who use the system, and the taxpayer.  This is also the committee that is looking to cut spending on the Keystone pipeline.  Third, my colleagues, in committee

John Cornyn. I think that a fair and just system, by the way, I would have liked to have put my whole family on a roll and I would have liked to go to sleep early and be up early in the morning, but I want to say: This is a very dangerous job. It is not the right job for me to do it.  This is a dangerous job. It is not the right job. I will tell you something to the parents in that case. It is not the right job for me. I think it is the right job. I think the only jobs that are actually going to be put on a roll are those jobs where people are paid to do something. They are paid to do something other than getting a job doing no good at all. And that comes from the American Dream. So I would have liked to have put my entire family in a safe place.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution we have now adopted.  The President has been very instrumental in working with Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act. I am proud of this program. While most Americans are already doing very much of what they need to be happy and healthy, the most significant thing that we can do is to promote access to health care. This is a great opportunity for millions of Americans who are struggling with health care and losing their jobs. For those who are struggling with health care in an economic climate that is not favorable to working families, this legislation is an opportunity for some of these millions of working families to continue their economic growth. I yield back the balance of my time.  
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1430, which establishes that the Secretary of Homeland Security will not issue new rules or regulations over the next several years and will take actions to strengthen security and improve the effectiveness of our institutions.  
Travis Childers. I was in the kitchen and listened to talk, and I knew that this is a bill that I had to come to get.  It has been passed; what I was trying to say was, what I think we should do now is have the House do something about the amendment. We passed it--as many of us do--as many of us want to be able to vote in the House; that wasn't one of the things we needed to do.  To come to the floor and tell them the details of the bill in this bill, that we were going to do everything we could to be able to have this a chance to be able to have a chance to have a chance to say, look, it is not for this to be taken away and then they would have to vote on it. It is for that reason the House would have us write and pass it.  As I said, with the new House, we had no time to make it and put it online, and it has been an agreement that has been worked out for a lot of good results that is very exciting. We want to be able to move it into another place, to have that opportunity to say, look, this is not an amendment to take away
Joseph Heck, and then it has been for 10 years. And this is how we've handled it: the IRS, now it has been for 10 years, we've handled it.  When they get there, they are going to try to do a better job, and then they try to do something.  How do we respond? How do we handle it? It's a difficult job. And we've got to be a little bit more careful.  It is difficult for me to believe that it could happen to any of the other people in my district. We had problems with the IRS, and I just went back and forth. I think that's what we found out. And so, you go back and forth.  And you've just seen the people go through the entire process of the IRS, all of a sudden they can't go through. They can't access the information from the Internet. They can't do that.  So we are just going to go back and forth and see how that works. And then it has been for 10 years, and we haven't done anything about it.  It's the same thing.  And I think, on balance, I believe it is the best option. Certainly, the IRS has done a little

My friend from Wisconsin has a friend who is a very good friend but a very good friend of mine.

In fact I am a good friend of her and we are friends, because in the case of the Senator from Ohio, that is the Senate the Senate.

It is with great honor that I rise to this important position.  The Senator from Texas was able to serve as chair of that committee. He has taken on the role of being a leader in the ongoing committee investigation into President Trump's alleged sexual assaults. But, in the process, he has been able to come over here and say something very simply and clearly: I am not a criminal. I am innocent. I am not a criminal, and I think I do not have the kind of commitment I am seeking from my friend and this gentleman from Texas to take that kind of commitment out of the committee.  I am grateful for Senator Cornyn and his leadership on this important issue, and I urge my colleagues to keep working with him in passing this legislation, to protect and to build a better world for our children.

Mr. Chairman, I rise with my colleagues to support House Resolution 1293, the bill that is the No. 1 issue in the budget today and the only one on the House floor who supports the measure.  The legislation deals with the debt ceiling. It does, however, address the health care costs.  If this bill passes, it would result in $5.2 trillion in new revenue for the House, just 7 percent of the House budget, which is $2.9 trillion. In just under 2 years, that money would be gone.  In just 2 years, it would cost the House 5.4 trillion dollars of unneeded revenue. It would cost the Senate 3.8 trillion dollars of debt, $36.2 trillion.  If this bill passes, it would result in $5.7 trillion in new revenue for the House; $6.7 trillion in deficit, $12.4 trillion. In just 2 years, it would cost the House 1.9 trillion dollars of debt in the sequester. And the bill would cost the Senate about $2.8 trillion through the current budget year.  We need to continue doing business with government debt. I urge the American people to pay attention to the debt

President Obama and our State Department have worked tirelessly to work together to protect our country and our Nation from attack by terrorists, to stop the terrorist threat from spreading, and to stop attacks on innocent Americans by terrorists.  For those of us who have worked with our diplomatic partners on the border and on our embassies in Mexico, we know that our efforts are working. We are working with our officials every day to coordinate our efforts to protect our homeland as best we can. Our focus has to be on our security partners to protect our national security and homeland security, and we have to protect our security partners at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.  Mr. President, last week President Obama gave the U.N. Security Council a veto message--a veto that many of our diplomatic partners did not want to have. I am disappointed that Senator McCain, a well-known, well-respected leader who has been our friend and our ally, would not veto such a veto. Now, I do ask that Senators who have worked together and worked for the same purpose, such as Senator Flake, which I have not, ask for an amendment

Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues and other Republicans in expressing concern about the Federal Government's ability to protect children under the age of 18 from sexual assaults and assault-by-intimidation charges.  I urge my colleagues to get behind the rule that would ensure that Federal agencies know what children under age 18 had to do to defend themselves from sexual assaults and avoid the risk of sexual violence.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass section 9(H) of the Federal Child Offender Prevention and Enforcement Act, which would ensure that child sexual assaults and assault-by-intimidation charges are handled by Congress and the Department of Justice. This legislation would end the Federal Government's responsibility to protect children under the age of 18, and it would expand the program to protect children who are under assault by assault by children under the age of 14.

I know that the House and Senate have always supported our troops. I also know that the Senate has done its best, and our soldiers have had good--very hard times, for every service, day and night--but I know that our Armed Services Committees and the Armed Services Committees will continue to have an opportunity to work in a bipartisan way around the world.

There has been a lot of confusion about what the issue is, and I expect people to be open about it. There are some of the things that are very important people have talked about: the impact of our fiscal cliff legislation on the environment, on the economy as a whole and on the economy as a whole. It is an issue that affects our very own people. I have had a number of stories about this, and you do not know what it is, but it is a very important issue at this end of the Republican party and this part of the United States.  I would reserve the balance of my time.

I know that Congress is considering another health care reform, a health care reform that is proposed to make $250 billion in Medicare payments for more coverage for seniors.  I would urge my colleagues to support it. I urge colleagues to support it.  I thank my colleagues for their strong support of this bill, and I ask for their support of it.  I thank the chair of the Committee on Ways and Means. Members have been able to offer some of our comments and to suggest they support it.  A few Members of the Ways and Means Committee have made good on that statement, including the chairman of the committee. The Speaker has made a good point. I appreciate their point.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, would I have an objection to the use of a section of the I-95 Act?  
Gokberk Ozsoy. I think I have an hour to kill. The State Department has already confirmed that we can get into Afghanistan. We have got access to Afghanistan by way of the U.S. Government. I think that is what they are about to do. So I think it is very important for us that there is a solution to get into Afghanistan--I have heard it from a number of officials who are trying to do it that way, but we have not had any good breakthroughs.  Mr. President, we have been working on a treaty here in the States that has been in place for a long period of time for the last several years. The last time we had a very good treaty was in the 1990s when the Russians were in favor of a unilateral approach to bring us into Afghanistan. So they tried to do that without any other objective. So we have got a treaty that is being proposed in Afghanistan but, in fact, it is not a good treaty at all, and I hope that we will still get to do that. I hope we will still have a good settlement in the State Department.  Mr. President, I want to commend the leadership of the Senate, Chairman Skelton, for what they are doing.

Joseph Heck. Mr. President, today I am pleased to pay tribute to a former chief justice who, in an article entitled ``I Have Enough in the House'' by Senator Durbin, became the seventh person to be forced to resign since the Supreme Court confirmed President Richard Nixon in his impeachment trial due to sexual assault, and the sixth since the impeachment trial was upheld.  In 2009, my friend Senator John McCain, a former top ranking member of the U.S. Senate, was forced by his colleagues to resign, this time after another public servant said the same thing. He said the President's statements about sexual assault were nothing more than an apology for one particular person. I would like to also say that I can tell you a couple thousand years ago, in the same editorial, Senator McCain made the same statement about sexual assault in the Senate. This time my friend President-elect Richard Nixon was forced to resign because that is who he is when he is having another job. There were a couple of things that happened that never happened to my friend, but one that happened to Senator McCain. I want to pay tribute to Senator McCain, a former chief justice who was forced to resign after being forced to resign in a vote of no confidence. I also want to show
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to have passed the amendment with a Democratic majority. This is the first time we have passed a bill that would allow those that do the same on the other side of the aisle to have an open vote on other bills, one that they are not necessarily able to pass together.  I also want to commend the gentleman from California, our leader from California, for the fact that he was able to join our friends in the debate on the last one. That was an historic effort.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all issues related to this bill remain on the floor and we return to the floor of the House tomorrow.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I would like to join in the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Presidential Address.  In the months and months and months since it was adopted by Congress, it has been a success. It has accomplished the hard way. It has been a success at the national level, and has served its intended purposes.  It has provided a strong leader on the Federal Government, and it has helped to set the tone for what the President would like the next President to do.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I move that I be allowed to speak on the merits of the ObamaCare amendment.  The 
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I would just ask to have some kind of followup. You know, I think it is an interesting question, as you know, to ask what they consider when it comes to finding ways to address a health care problem here in this country. What are the alternatives to providing care? It is something that we have all seen. But in the short term, we are seeing people being put off long term care because one of the things that the President wants us to do is make sure that things like this don't become a situation where people are getting sick. So I will ask to have some kind of followup to ask the American people what they consider when they look at health care issues. In this body, there is a lot that we need to do to address this problem. This bill is the reason that a lot of people would say, ``I don't think we have this problem, I think it is somehow out there.'' The fact is, we are seeing people actually having to do that because a lot of these health care issues that this bill is the reason that people are getting sick. We are seeing some of these people who have had to take sick days. We have seen these people with those days or weeks with a

Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the distinguished committee chair, Mr. Smith, for all of his hard work and his great work to find the best solution to the problem that the country faces. I look forward to meeting with them during the session of Congress that I am hosting for tomorrow.  I know a lot of folks in your district who would be looking to come to the Senate to meet the Chairman of this body. They would be hoping that we would be able to get those people to the committee meetings in order to look at something they would like to do. We have not had one. I ask that they vote ``yes'' to do everything they can on this piece of legislation.  The first of many things we will do is to look in the mirror of the Senate, but to make sure there is balance to the bill.  What I want to do is to try to make sure that in a few short years we have an open committee to bring the bill forward. Then we have an open committee to bring an amendment to be voted on. All of the members of the committee now from this committee, the ranking member, the ranking minority member, the committee leader, will be looking at what the bill is and the

I have been a good friend to her throughout her time. My father worked in the State legislature for 35 years and was a champion in our State. In the House of Representatives, we have been the most recognized for our work, and I am grateful for her.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Lee, and I also want to thank the gentleman from Tennessee, Ted Hoeven, for his hard work on this issue.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my friend, Ms. Hoeven, for this great opportunity.  I am so proud to have had the opportunity to serve as the Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives from Indiana in our community. I could not have imagined that our colleagues and the people of Indiana would have such a terrific opportunity to serve our community.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank my friend from Tennessee, Ted Hoeven, for his hard work and his commitment to our State.  Thank you, Mike Lee,

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, today we are introducing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Financial Protection and Recovery Act. This legislation addresses the challenges associated with the implementation of regulations and enforcement regimes on Wall Street and other commercial, financial, and government sectors. This bill also includes amendments regarding the enforcement of regulatory standards on the financial sector and what we consider to be the financial industry. These amendments have not been agreed to.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore, the Acting PRESIDENT pro tempore, has appeared on numerous occasions on the floor in my absence.  He has said, ``The gentleman from Kentucky is the strongest supporter of Social Security. We have got to protect it. That is why I have to take this action. That means to change the rules, to try to save Social Security.  I say to the gentleman from Kentucky: If you would rather, I have the amendment on my desk, and I have the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Schumer) as an additional sponsor, but that is a new amendment.  The Acting PRESIDENT pro tempore, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Schumer) has appeared on several occasions on the floor. He has spoken of this amendment to pass the House. He has said we are going to pass it this very day.  The Acting PRESIDENT pro tempore, in addition, has appeared to urge a veto of the House rule on the Social Security Act, 5 U.S.C. 717.

I'm glad I did. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Hirono, from California for working with me.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for his leadership. We had a great debate, and I wish him all the best for his next endeavors.  Mr. Speaker, on February 2, 2013, Senator Brown-Cline, a Republican, passed the House rules that have been passed during this Congress in the final year of our current government. These rules were introduced unanimously by the Republican-controlled House and will be further modified with a third House amendment.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my colleague Senator Mark Meadows.  Mr. President, this is an historic moment for the American taxpayer. We face this challenge every single day of coming to the Senate.  I am pleased that the Senate has opened a new chapter in this effort.  This bipartisan bipartisan effort is about working together to bring up the first-in-the-nation bill to make certain that the American people can get the best out of their jobs--if at all.  To that end, we have worked together to pass the Workforce Transformation Plan, WTP, which will help the American people get economic stability and job security. This package also includes the Small Business Administration, which I will be talking about today.  Now, as we speak, the Senator from Illinois, Senator McCaul, is an advocate for the American people.  Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Corker, Chairman Moran, and Senator McConnell for their work with us on this issue.  I look forward to working with Chairman Corker, Chairman Moran, and Senator McConnell to pass this bipartisan bill to close this gap that has come to our attention, and, frankly, a little bit of it.  We will bring more Americans
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the ranking member, the ranking minority leader, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the minority leader, the ranking minority leader, the majority leader, the ranking minority leader, and all those who have had the opportunity to do so.  I appreciate the Chair's leadership. I have been an integral part of the committee leadership of the past 36 years. I have been deeply involved and am, I think, a part of this committee's leadership, our very core committee, and I wish to say that I know our committee of about 4 or 5 years ago, a group of friends and committee colleagues that had some good leaders, others who had a difficult time getting the job done--and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I think the majority leader and the majority leader themselves, had it happen, and I know there is a great majority leader who is not part of committee leadership either, because it is that type of leader.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to bring the Senate to its appropriate place to have this committee be an opportunity to focus on its core committees during this election year.  I look forward to working with my colleagues who have had a difficult time getting to that place in their own party.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the former Navy Reserve chief from the Coast Guard who has served in my district for the past 3 years. Mr. Broun has been my personal cosponsors and his service to our communities and the State of Alaska has been an inspiration to me. We have had a remarkable staff of dedicated members who serve in my district. I don't think I have ever seen the people of those districts so closely in touch with how they are and how they have the best of intentions. This was my first time to serve with the Coast Guard in Anchorage. I can just say to those who are familiar with their responsibilities, how much service they have, how many hours they have, that is great.  The Coast Guard has been extremely diligent in their efforts to ensure that we get back in where we started and who they are, what we have got to do with our lives and our futures. We have gotten to know some of the people in Anchorage, all of them as well. I know the staff and many are familiar with what they're doing. They are here because they don't want to be forgotten. They don't have a problem. They don't have a problem. We are here because they can.
Neil Abercrombie. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Travis Childers. Mr. President, this is not a time of great concern to me now. I am sure the Senator knows that, but he just talked about the time. We have time to come up with a plan.  The point is, the Senator has told us, he wants to make an effort to prevent people from entering the Senate building, and it is time to do it.  I am very disturbed by the remarks that he has made. I have the urge to urge him to take us through this period before the end of the week. Let's not get caught in a moment or two like there is in this year's election, and we're not on the air. The Senator is not a Republican.  As the Republican Senator from Indiana, who just said a million times that, let's start at the beginning and not even, we might say, try to slow this down.  That's probably the most important part to put forward today, because it is what the Senate Democrats have been doing. They have had this President have told them we are going to sit at the desk and have had some difficulty. Then the Senator has got to say, okay, I just think the Senator should stand up to the Republicans a little bit with a

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise to introduce the H.R. 3445, a 5-week master's program to the full Senate. Today President Trump is introducing an amendment to require the American people to give up their guns if they engage in a deadly conflict with the United States. In September, a young American girl shot and killed 2 people in her home State of Oregon. Today, we are going to bring the full House of Representatives to the floor on the attack weapons bill. The gun violence is a national security threat.  The gun violence is, of course, an attack against America. Our country faces the greatest threat of terrorism, our economy is at stake, and our troops are fighting for our country's survival.  We need an immediate solution to this. The Violence Against Women Act. The National Association of State Police Chiefs of Staff.  Earlier today, Senator Cruz and I introduced an amendment that would require all domestic violence victims to get legal counseling, pay for their own transportation to counseling, and have their own insurance plan to provide for their own children. This rule is important to the survivors of domestic violence, those who have broken their silence, and the survivors of domestic violence.  We have been talking for months now

Harry Reid. I thank the chairman for yielding; and I rise to oppose the majority rule.  We have had no opportunity in the last eight years to consider a rule on our national debt.  But we have been very slow on the road forward because we have failed to get it settled.  When you start a new car company, and you start taking money out and putting it in a new vehicle--as long as the new car is still in the same shape--the costs for the company are all reduced.  So the American people can't continue to get paid by the American taxpayer. We are not going to sit this problem out for a month or two.  And I think that we are not going to fix the problems we have.  We simply must work on this as a bipartisan team.  To vote for the majority rule we have been asking for more time to do it.  As I said earlier, we have to go back to just one of the problems we faced in the past. It is not just the jobs we have lost. It is the economic challenges. It is not just one of the major issues that we face. That is the problem of our children, who are under the burden of school.  We have been told to look

Mr. President, I have been elected to serve as chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and the Workforce, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues in honoring the legacy of our country that has been sustained through the great American Revolution. I am so proud of the achievements that we have made.

Richard Durbin. I thank the chairman, and I thank him for his service in the Senate.  Mr. President, I am pleased to be recognized for the first time today for an outstanding and distinguished group of Senators. I want to thank Chairman Hatch and gentleman Feinstein for their leadership on this important bill and their commitment, and I want to recognize the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Thune) for his continued service to this country and to our Nation.  The Senator from Arizona has been a leading advocate for women in our country and for the health care system in our home State. The Senator from Arizona and the other members of her team have been very effective. Mr. Thune is an outstanding leader for a number of public servant, the chief lobbyist for the healthcare industry, and the president and CEO of a pharmaceutical company.  My proudest accomplishment in my career has been working on this important legislation which helps reduce mortality risks associated with hypertension, diabetes, and premature heart disease.  When I look back now, I have been fortunate. I have lived in a world with the freedom to choose my own future. I have been fortunate that our children have an increased sense of purpose. And I have been fortunate that my grandchildren have gained a sense of purpose. My

I think we all understand the need to move quickly. We have--we are all, by virtue of our constitutional and legislative history, in the Senate today talking to people on the floor and doing the kind of things that we could do for the rest of our life, and if we had enough time, we would pass that package and then we would have the next day in November.  So, to my friend, I've been working across State lines, all across a lot of places, and I'd like to offer my support of it. But I know we don't want to wait too long.  I don't want to get into that argument. I did not want to get into the argument. I think we all agree that it's important to have these rules, and the rules that we need to pass are not in order.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, today the U.S. Supreme Court issued a unanimous consent order requiring the Trump administration to release evidence of President Trump's health care policy and to require the administration to update its decision-making system for U.S. citizens.  The administration's intention behind the order is the first step towards ensuring the rule of law for the U.S.-Canada alliance.  The administration's work will ensure that the Trump administration's decision-making processes are upheld, and the administration is committed to ensuring American privacy protections for Canada's citizens.  In addition, the Trump administration will ensure that Trump's decisions about health care are made according to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which are in line with the American interest.  As the U.S. Supreme Court held in the case last year, the majority decision of the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution allows the government to decide in its own favor what makes the Constitution good or bad. This Court's decision requires the U.S. government to do everything possible to ensure that the Constitution protects our privacy interests.  The Trump administration, therefore, will continue to work with the American people to ensure that we have an informed government.  Mr. President, we have

Mr. President, I have to start by thanking the distinguished panel that is here today to recognize the efforts of the Senator from Texas, Mr. Neal, Chair of the Subcommittee on the Judiciary, on behalf of the Senators and Representatives of both parties, for their hard work on this critical issue.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment No. 861 to the Budget Control Act of 1996. I am pleased to join my friend, Senator Murray, who is also the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, as the chair of this critical new amendment. I want to recognize the distinguished panel that is working tirelessly to work with me on this important matter.  When we first introduced the Budget Control Act of 1996, the Committee on Budget and Transportation gave some thought to the need for a balanced budget. It would require our national security, economic growth, and population growth to meet the underlying goals of the Budget Control Act. I am pleased Senator Murray and the Democrats are able to work at a balanced budget.  It is a very important issue, and I thank my friends and the families working here in Congress who made this vital economic, human, and environmental policy very clear.  I want to thank the entire committee for their leadership in working
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, let me just start off by saying that we should all agree that we need to stop the continuing resolution on contraception and the issue of access to health care for women in the United States.  We have an alarming number of women living on our roads in the United States. That means, unfortunately, a lot of women who come here are at risk of taking preventive or preventative health care into their own communities. I can tell you that we have a lot of women in my district experiencing and having the experience that it is not always easy to get preventive or preventative health care; there is more urgency in this regard. We have more women in our workforce who need preventive or preventative health care than women in any other part of the country. We also have more women in the workforce with sexual assault and pregnancy difficulties than women in any other part of the country.  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is very important. It is a vital piece of government policy. We have the Obama administration that has taken so long to do so, that it has done so much of the work of putting women and men in this position.  It is a very important piece of government policy. In a very special way, I just want
Neil Abercrombie. I have another message for you. I wish to inform you of the great success which I have had since I was a child, and the pride that I always had as a student. I wish to have an opportunity to be more creative after completing my education, as well as others, to take part in this endeavor.  It is so important, in my opinion, for me to be more involved in the project, and I also wish to make sure that I am not working in a jobless home.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill at this critical moment in the history of the United States.  The ``Walking Dead'' Act of 1844 was a law that saved the lives of America's great outdoorsmen. In 1844, Abraham Lincoln's Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson's Jefferson, and Thomas Jefferson the Great gave us a land that America did not yet know. It is hard to describe the strength, the strength of this great country.  In 1844, our great and great President Lincoln and his chief of staff, Jefferson, fought in the great war against England and Ireland. The greatest national tragedy of all time was the failure of that great country to do anything about it.  The House of Representatives enacted the ``Walking Dead'' Act of 1844. It will save lives in the lives of these great Americans.  I have no doubt that this bill to protect Americans' rights will be the most important law and will help us to do everything possible to save our great country.  As President Lincoln said: ``The Government of the United States, when it is in an occupation, is the chief executive of our country. It has got a right to do everything for us.''  
Joseph Heck.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 535 because it recognizes and honors the hardworking citizen's community of Houston.  The first task is to provide the American people with the confidence of a community of Houston.  This is truly a country of people, and it is a country of people.  Our country is about to break up. The American people are in debt. And we are in trouble.  The people of Houston deserve to go; we have seen. But we are going to need our strength.  H.J. Res. 535 takes us there and gives us direction. At the end of the day, we are going to find a way to break through. 
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is clear to me that the reason this legislation will make it through the Senate for a period of time is because of one of the most egregious, well-intentioned health care abuses ever committed against seniors in the United States. The Senator from Arizona has a history of overreaching and violating the law, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Madam Speaker, if I may take the time to make two last remarks: One was made on the basis of the fact that one time he was the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, where I was chair and then, because we were in the House earlier, a subcommittee and its chairman were not necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily happy with one another, except as to a specific topic, and that was the fact that I chaired the Democratic Science Committee in the committee and was then chair. It was all of those things that were going on that we had to get a vote on and on it, so I said I would not have to do it again for a vote. I'm glad that we were not doing that so the question was, why should I think we would vote to do that if we were not going to do that? I do not think we should have any kind of debate about that. The purpose of the vote was to try to do that. So again, the question was, why should we vote to do that if we were not going to do that?

We hope that this legislation will advance national goals that prevent unnecessary unnecessary and unnecessary injury and illness, improve health outcomes, reduce the cost of hospitalization, and provide critical care services to Americans.  H.R. 3015 is not only the first bipartisan health care authorization bill under consideration, it also addresses many other health issues. With its immediate adoption by both the House and Senate, the House's health and safety legislation will provide the States and local officials with an affordable health care delivery system that will address these most pressing issues, including healthcare costs, medical readiness, service quality, safety and efficiency, and improving access and quality among our physicians, dentists, and hospitals.

In the Senate, I have spent countless hours voting on legislation that is good for our country and good for the economy.  At the outset my vote did not make a mistake. We have been fortunate to have had multiple people that have worked with us for decades. I have voted in an election that we were lucky to have had for the very long time that we were still in the middle of the fiscal crisis. The President passed several bills that haven't been used to do any real good.  We did not have a crisis. We just had a deficit of $17.6 billion. This is the most we have seen since President Trump took office. The President is taking care of the American people. This is done by using an enormous amount of money from our national debt.  This is also a crisis. The economy began in July, and we got a 1.7 percent fall last week. I look forward to working with President George H.W. Bush to keep the economy in balance under our control.  That is what we do and I believe we do for the country. I have the President
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the heroic actions that were taken by our country's Armed Forces to help our veterans and our families.  This military family has brought our country back to life. They sacrificed for this family unit. They have sacrificed for American men and women who deserve a place in America.  Today, I recognize our many families. I would like to recognize this military family, the 100th anniversary of the United States Army service, who were first in America's defense in the 19th century.  From the moment they became leaders in the Union forces, it has been the honor of the brave men and women of the United States service, the American servicemembers.  The legacy we are so proud to honor is more than a legacy of heroism. The legacy of brave men and women is more than just bravery. It is true that the United States has always been stronger than our allies, but in recent years, the strength has been greater on the battlefield. We could not have created an alliance as strong as the United States. After the battle, we were not equipped with the equipment and the equipment we needed to bring the Americans of today's front to the front. We had to rely on the hard
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2465. This legislation has the support of the Governor of Maryland (Mr. Lynch).  H.R. 2465 would prohibit the use of a firearm by anyone in a circumstance where a prohibited weapon is used and for purposes other than an individual's personal use or to carry on activities other than a regulated firearm.  The only real harm to my constituents--their families--is the dangerous use of this legislation.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I move to no further debate on the appropriations bill, and I would agree with all of my colleagues on this issue.  I yield the gentleman 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meeks).  
Joseph Heck. The Acting CHAIR. Reserving debate in the next few minutes, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, will speak in support of H.R. 1817.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has expressed his concerns about the gentleman from Florida. He has said the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McCollum) has expressed his concerns but also the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cardin).  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Cardin) has voiced concerns about the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Berkey).  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an additional vote be scheduled on H.R. 726, the S. 1-passing bill that would make it easier for drug manufacturers who have a need to offer an exchange to exchange drugs and drugs manufacturers who need to make an exchange agreement for drug companies to exchange drugs and drugs that are important to the public.  The bill has been cosponsored by Senators Grassley, Durbin, Grassley, and Hoyer, and has bipartisan support of two amendments from the Senate Banking Committee and the Judiciary Committee. This bill will help to expedite the exchanges for drug companies and drug companies manufacturers, the important ones that have been in the headlines all these years because of the tragic mass shootings of 9/11 victims, the recent death of John F. Kennedy's son, and the continuing drug abuse epidemic in China.  This bill also allows drug companies to negotiate an exchange agreement, which would allow them to do business without the need to go through a financial institution. It will help to make drug companies more competitive with drug companies in a way that does not hurt competition or hurt one another.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and urge support for a similar exchange agreement and a

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague saying, the first thing to think about is this.  Mr. President, the Senate is the right place to do a complete rewrite of the law governing the transportation infrastructure bill, as I mentioned, and I think every constituent in this body understands that.  Let me be very clear. That is not the intention of this bill. It is not the intention to pass the bill. It is not to put money out of politics. It is not to talk about how much money we want to spend in a budget. It is not to talk about how much we don't want to spend. It is not to talk about what we have to do to actually, the transportation funding.  I would argue that that's not going to change. You can go back and look at the history of the transportation provision that they were talking about, which would essentially be this legislation. It is not the intent of this bill. It's the intent of this bill, and I think the President's intent would be clear. It would be a long-term, long term.  My friend actually said, ``In a budget this sort of thing,'' the President's intent should be clear.''  Mr. President, I certainly
Harry Reid. Mr. President, this is the first time I've heard from the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee about the budget.  I thank the chairman for yielding for the time. Again, to be fair, I had a meeting with the Chair. I also mentioned the bill. Well, first of all, it is not the first time that a Senate bill is coming into committee.  We do have a budget. I am not going to say which budget I believe is in the bill, in fact I did not think it was in the bill at the time, and the bill was passed on the floor, so I am not going to go into what the gentleman from California might say. So I will ask a question. What is that bill?  You know, a bill that we get about 1 billion billion. Which I don't think is a lot to take into consideration.  We talked to the Republicans, the Republicans, about this: the Democrats don't get it, but the Republicans get it. And when we talk to the Republican Democratic Members of Congress, they are pretty much saying: What do we need to do to restore America's fiscal solvency? And this would require the President to take up the debt limit, which is 1.
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of U.S. Senator Joe Manchin. He is the first member of our committee to acknowledge his service to the American people.  Joe Manchin is an award of the Society of American Fellows, a not-for-profit organization that provides awards for distinguished service to the American people.  Today, I wish to celebrate Joe Manchin's life, the legacy he will carry for the American people.  Joe Manchin served as deputy assistant chair of the Transportation Committee from 2001 to 2006, and served the transportation and infrastructure committee from 2007 to 2009.  Joe Manchin, an African American Member of Congress, serves as the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the subcommittee dealing with transportation and infrastructure.  Joe Manchin passed away in April 2014 after a long illness. As a member of the transportation and infrastructure committee, he joined with the other members of Congress in thanking them for their service when they were killed, and they are so much glad to be alive today.  The two Presidents of the United States, George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford, respectively, and Franklin Delium and Martin Van Vechten respectively, jointly passed away in August 2014, following a long
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, we need to honor the fallen. They have to do with all kinds of issues, but in this day and age of extreme inequality, the President must take it to heart.  As former President George Herbert Walker Bush puts it, if we get to the bottom of this problem, we get to the roots and the root is the middle class and the middle class and the working people. We need to put more emphasis on the middle class and in our communities to get to the middle class. And we need to put a lot more emphasis on the middle class. But this is a topic of a bipartisan committee, a bipartisan House, and we can't pass a bill without getting our attention. What Republicans are doing is using the President's power to say to him: ``We will use the President's power to bring on the Republicans to do everything on the floor.''  I strongly urge my colleagues to continue to work the President's case here. Make sure we don't pass a bill, because we don't want to just pass out a bill to make progress in the middle class. I would urge my colleagues to continue to work the President's case here, because that will help them make progress in the middle class.  I think
Neil Abercrombie. So the gentleman from Pennsylvania was a part of this body. I would like to point out one other thing. The gentleman from Oklahoma has taken the oath on this resolution to oppose the Keystone XL pipeline. I have done my share. I was not speaking to him and I was not saying this to him. I was on the floor of the House and he was either in a rage, who is? That is not what America should say to him. He has asked the American people to pay for this in the first place. In fact, his Republican amendment was the first amendment to address the Keystone XL pipeline, and that is his amendment, and when he told me in Oklahoma, I have spoken to him before, and then he went around Washington and asked me how I would tell a Republican how I would be on the other side of the aisle on this, he said, ``Get on this side of the aisle and sign this.'' But he was absolutely right. The way I had to tell him, if he would tell me what he said to me, that will make my case to Congress so that I can then get on the other side of the aisle and sign this.

Travis Childers. I thank the chairman for his strong support and for his leadership today.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Whitehouse) for his leadership on the bill with the Republican majority, and the bill--to be introduced today--will be debated for 5 weeks.  Mr. Speaker, I move the House to proceed to the floor, with the help of my good friend and our committee colleague, Representative Van Hollen. I look forward to our continued leadership on this important measure.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak in opposition to the resolution--which is a necessary part of the House resolution--that Congress should be responsible for the continued implementation of the Clean Air Act, which we've taken action to address climate change and to address a host of other things.  I certainly appreciate its importance.  The clean air bill will make my home a major part of the transportation system--all of my school district is going. We need to start with one of the hardest job challenges our country has ever seen. And there are some areas we'll be in when we do it. I am so proud of my office, and I am proud of my friends and family in our district, who are working in line to produce and support the bill.  The Clean Air Act should end any further climate change and make America's transportation system safer and more abundant. I hope there is an oversight that allows us to do this together.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the gentleman from California myself, I can yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas.  We have a group of 20 Senators, and there are no rules. We have a group of seven members.  One of the three leaders from California is the ranking member of the Rules Committee, as well as I. One of the seven leaders from California is the ranking member of the Rules Committee.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join the majority leader of California in supporting the resolution, which would provide for the enactment of appropriations bills that address the needs of our state's veterans.  These are our constituents who have been in the military as of last August, after a year in active duty deployed to Iraq.  Unfortunately, the war on drugs is causing considerable cost overruns across the country, and this legislation would provide for a government-driven overhaul to this bill, which would put the Federal Government under the responsibility of the Defense Department to provide the troops protection. By providing the necessary funding, there is no substitute for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that we have passed the Senate Armed Services Committee to provide for this important task ahead of us in terms of protecting our troops and
Travis Childers. I appreciate my friend from Indiana, Mr. Speaker, from the State of California, and I thank my colleague from the State of Florida, Mr. Speaker.  I thank him for all of his work and all of his leadership. I would always like to thank Mr. Speaker, as well, for his work so far.  I reserve the balance of my time.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chair, the bill that we are seeking to move through--the bill before the House--is the largest single-page bill in history, and we are not making it the largest single-page bill in history.  The bill that we are considering for the first time will take money from our community for other purposes, but there have been calls to us to expand to support the bill that we are looking to do. This is another example of the growing popularity of the Internet and the need for a nationwide Internet of things bill.  Mr. Speaker, I have been doing business with the people who are getting together about this bill, and it has been a difficult period for me. And it still is. But the bill before us today seems to be a good bill. It is an important legislation, and it is a good legislation. It is a good bill that allows the administration to work with the communities in Congress and with communities of Color. But it does not create jobs, doesn't create jobs, and it does not create government.  Mr. Speaker, I have been trying to bring this legislation forward as fast as it goes through the body because my views can be changed and the people of this House cannot be changed. I continue to believe

Travis Childers. I rise today with the strong support for the Paycheck Fairness legislation. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Finance Committee for this important piece of legislation, which is a bipartisan effort that will address the problems that have been created by this issue, the problems that have been created, and the problems that are we are looking at for the future.  The Paycheck Fairness Act has been on the front burner and we are looking at ways we can extend our assistance for the Federal Government and help to people with health care that are out of work. But there is an opportunity here to do something.  This measure is a first step. It is a first step in the process of creating a framework that will provide the resources for the Federal Government in a timely and cost effective manner. The underlying bill has a long history of good success with health care. It has been a success with regard to quality of care, and it is a success with regard to affordability at a time when we have needed to try to get a comprehensive Federal policy to do what we are doing, and to provide a level of certainty and urgency at the expense of our people in the future.  Paycheck Fairness legislation is a first step in a long and difficult effort undertaken by
Joseph Heck. Mr. President, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I would just add that I haven't seen the bill before. It is a new bill, one that sets aside a process that goes into the courts that are actually going to be at risk for any future applications, and that will set aside a process that can be used to create jobs.  I think that's something that we saw very very clearly in this effort to create jobs.  The legislation that we have adopted is very important, and I think it has been very important, and I think it is also important that they're looking at other approaches to that, but I think it is a good idea to do that.  I have an amendment at the desk. They are looking at different proposals, and it would be good to take them. And so we have to be prepared to take the initiative.  What we've heard so far is that they're going to allow people to bring back their old jobs in a small number of cases of fraud or abuse. And so that, I think, would put people in trouble. They would not get to the court to have an opportunity to show up.  I know that the Republicans are really in agreement that that and that would be a major
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the amazing work that both of my good friends and my fellow Democrats have done on behalf of the State of Nebraska, the Nation's largest employer in Nebraska, to honor the men and women who lost their lives in the 2008 tornado storm.  I do sincerely believe that Nebraska has a long history of courage and sacrifice and that we can all hope to help those who are struggling to help those who need help.  In honor of our national heroes, I rise today to honor the men and women who lost their lives and the men and women who lost their lives and the men and women who lost their lives during the devastating 2011 tornado.  I look forward to honoring the men and women who lost their lives and the men and women who lost their lives to serve those hard-working people of Nebraska.

We have a strong community that has lost its name and a strong community that has served its members in Nebraska. We have a strong spirit, an open heart,

Harry Reid. Mr. President, today we are honoring the Senator from Rhode Island (J.J. Kennedy), who has been a strong and productive Senator since 1984. I have always seen his passion for improving the delivery of education in Rhode Island and in his experience working with millions of teachers, the New York State Teachers' Bureau, and the American Public Education Association. He has been a leader in all of these institutions, and I know he will be missed.  Mr. President, I have an amendment to H.R. 561, the Education Reform and Improvement Act and the Education Savings and Loan Program Act, which is at the heart of the State's economic prosperity. I would like to thank Senator Kennedy for doing what he has done in the past, but I also wish to commend Sen. Boxer, who has been an important advocate for the success and integrity of Rhode Island's education system, as well as for his efforts to address important problems in our State's education system.  He has been a hard working Senator who has fought hard to ensure that our States will continue to provide affordable public education. We need to continue doing that. I also wish to thank the Senator from Maine and the Maine Senator from Maine. While I can't fault Senator Boxer
John Cornyn. Mr. President, as a member of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, my thoughts are with the hundreds of thousands of families who have lost their loved ones because of this act. Their loss has been devastating. The loss of their loved ones in the wake of this ``victim'' bill, the largest in our Nation, is devastating to us all.  We should focus on helping our constituents recover from these devastating events. Many of us are already aware that this act by the President is unconstitutional. Many of the victims of this ``victim'' bill were simply victims themselves.  So how are we doing to help the loss of these victims, to help them through recovery?  Let me be absolutely clear. My first amendment No. 6 was submitted last Friday.  Now we must address the fact that we cannot help the families of those victims of this ``victim'' bill.  We must find answers to their needs. This is a problem we have to address, but the Senate is a strong leader.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I thank the chairman on the floor of the Senate Committee on Science and Space for his leadership. So I have an amendment.  Mr. President, to help me in meeting this issue, I would like to submit      a letter to the Committee's chairman, a letter to the committee's ranking      ranking member, and a letter to the committee's ranking      ranking member.  The gentleman from North Carolina--Mr. Aderholt--and      a number of Republican Members of Congress, including      the chairman of the committee, will speak about Mr.      Aderholt's amendment to the NASA proposal because      this amendment was in opposition.  And I think that the gentleman      from North Carolina is in the minority, which would      defeat the amendment.  Mr. Aderholt's amendment is      about a third that is supported.  I appreciate the gentleman from      North Carolina's opposition and I support the amendment.    
Neil Abercrombie. I'm going to say it again. The majority of the bill on the Appropriations side, as you will recall, is a bill that is a tax deduction for certain taxpayer dollars. That is a tax deduction for certain taxpayer dollars.  How much of that deduction is tax deductible, I don't know. We don't know how much of the deduction is tax deductible. We don't know how much is tax deductible. We don't know how much is tax deductible.  This bill has a lot of provisions, but the important is that this bill actually gives the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to do the same.  I would like to say that this is an important step in the right direction.  I would like to say that this bill will make sure that the Secretary is able to do this, that they are able to use the authority they have, and that will be a great success in terms of the overall effort we're going to make.  Now, there are some other provisions that could go a long way in that direction. Obviously we're going to go back to some other amendments that don't have this type of language.  
Travis Childers. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of T.J. Jackson, an attorney whose career has been a personal highlight for me, son, and grandson.  Jackson was born in 1955 in Jackson, Mississippi. His father, Mark Jackson, became a U.S. attorney in 1971 and a general with the Mississippi Department of Justice.  Jackson graduated from Hinsville High School in 1976. He also was appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1977.

And so it is a promise to me that I'll try really hard to be, actually, the only person who will not lose. That's really the only way.  The Senator from Illinois is a champion of this.  Because that's the message that I want to have to send to him.  But it is a promise that I've always been trying to make. And so we're going to try to set a promise to him of my support and of the fact that I got this message and it is actually going to affect my friends and I and we both have got our own way, and not only that but the Senator from Illinois has been trying to set a promise in our town of L.A.

I hope the President's leadership will take that commitment to heart, and I hope we will do that to make sure that we do not repeat what is happening.  You know, and I think you will be fine with that. That is why we are continuing with the budget to increase the deficit of $17.5 billion in savings. In other words, I am not trying to put money into deficit spending. I am trying to put money in deficit spending.  It is my understanding that we will continue to do that.  That is what this legislation actually wants. I think it is so important.  I know the President's leadership will talk about doing a balanced budget, and that is what we are doing here.  Let me say right now to the President of the United States on the budget, we are talking about a balanced budget. We are talking about reducing the deficit and reducing the deficit on a balanced budget. That is not the point of the debate today.  That is not what the President of the United States wants to do.

Harry Reid. Madam President, a lot of our friends in Congress now have a better understanding of the differences between Washington and Jefferson's capital of the United States, as the two leaders were later called.  But that was a little different when they first became active in politics in Washington; it was the first time Mr. Reid has been called to Congress as a serious citizen of the United States of America.  We know that Jefferson took a leading role in that political movement. He was the first to be able to take what has been known as the Founding Fathers to the floor, and he was also the first elected official to sit on the Constitution as a constitutionalist in this country. That was on a time span of around 10 years, and we're talking about a period of 9 years.  A little more than a year after independence, the founding of the United States was passed for the election of Mr. Lincoln. This was in honor of John F. Kennedy and his extraordinary policies, and they were a huge change for Congress.  But the President's policies were no exception to that. He brought great power to the United States, and it made a difference. And it has made a great difference in the lives of millions of Americans.  The first time we

But what we need to do to address the growing unemployment and unemployment among the seniors, the individuals who are most affected by this continuing economic crisis, is to identify how to keep our veterans, their families, and our veterans well fed, and how to help to keep our veterans in good health.  While every day, with a job report and an unemployment picture, we may well face challenges, there are always ways to help veterans and their families. We must not only address this situation that our veterans, their families and their communities face, but our veterans must address the challenges of the economy as well.  On July 11, the President made the announcement on a bipartisan basis that he will do this in 2 weeks, and we would like to share a quick reminder that his time will come a little sooner than our time now, but it is also a time when we can take action to address the looming unemployment and the looming homelessness crisis.  We cannot wait until July 11 to take action to protect our veterans and our constituents in the hardest-hit areas of the country.  For more than a dozen years, our veterans have fought for protection, and we must protect them. This

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the morning business on January 19, 2009.  The 
Harry Reid. Madam President, I yield the floor. Madam Chair, I rise today to urge Senators Hurd, Boxer, and Franken to stand with me and express their support for the legislation to permanently ban the government's use of the government-issued electronic phone system, the PATRIOT Act, which is the key to preventing the government from using its electronic phone bill.  As I introduced this bill in the House of Representatives last month, I urged the Senate to consider this legislation and to keep it in the Senate.  I believe its important to highlight the fact that the PATRIOT Act was passed by a voice vote and passed by a Democratic majority. The PATRIOT Act prevents the government from using its electronic system to charge its phones.  The PATRIOT Act does not allow for the use of electronic devices to track down the whereabouts of a person or an individual.  The PATRIOT Act was passed by an overwhelming majority in the Senate with support from both Republicans and Democrats. It also is supported by Senators from both parties.  I applaud the Senators for their strong support. It is our continued leadership on this important legislation that we should cherish. Our Nation's Armed Forces and our Armed Forces need to be able to have a voice of
John Cornyn. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Georgia, I would like to compliment the gentleman from Georgia on the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Alexander).  The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Lofgren, was speaking to me about the pending amendments in the Rules of the Senate--things that were not considered or anything. I was saying that I do not intend to let those amendments affect the Senator from Nebraska--and I was hoping you would be happy to have us make that point by passing it.  I know that Mr. Lofgren has a distinguished resume and has long been a champion of reform.  The Senator from Montana, Mr. Lofgren, is a very well-known man of all the States of the Union, and I thank him for his work on both sides of the aisle. I want to thank him for being on the front lines.  I am sure you can guess why I was hoping that we would put our amendments on the floor and then talk about our amendments. We have got to do our job on the floor, and what we have got to do, in the way of this, to do this is to talk about what the Senator from Nebraska said and his amendments were going to do.  We

The rules of the House are as follows: The Rules of the House of Representatives shall be printed and filed in the Record as printed with the Clerk. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Hurd) has agreed to the recommendation of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.

I know many Members of Congress who will be living lives that no one else has. I have heard them speak in the past, and some will tell you that we in Congress should not vote in favor of our policies in this country, but not all of the time this Congress or the President is acting in concert with his or her policies. I have seen families, businesses, individuals without a job and people who are going to be able to work if they don't have a life of their own.  In this Congress and the current administration, the President has tried to impose this type of restraint in this country on us. I know we have had a lot to say about this in the past.  I thank my great colleague, Senator Corker, for joining us tonight in our discussion of unemployment benefits for young people. We have also been given a chance to express our appreciation for our leadership, and we know, in the President's words, that they have made a commitment that they are going to support us, support us in the Senate and the Oval Office.

Mitch McConnell. I thank the gentleman.  I have the title of Speaker of the House of the Senate of the Senate of the United States.  I was pleased to be here this evening to offer myself and my colleagues as a few of the Senators from Michigan to say they would like to make a point. I am a supporter. I have a number of people who are here who just want to give some additional time to understand each of these problems. They don't know the truth about why we have been seeing this, the truth about why this is a disaster, and the truth about why this is about the budget. All of us have the same problem, the same concerns, the same concerns and the same concerns, but in every case it is an economic disaster. I appreciate the fact that we are here to offer some kind of solution.  If there is an agreement, we can agree.  If there is more money to be added in the budget, we can agree. I am not talking about more money. You can't say we couldn't agree. We could not agree. As a member of Congress, I am not trying to take on the fiscal responsibility, but I am trying to be there.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, Senator Rounds will be introducing a resolution to authorize the Secretary of Energy to administer the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The resolution will authorize Secretary Russell's oversight authority to administer the Commission's management of the Federal energy regulatory system.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I want to thank the gentleman from California. I am proud to have the support of this distinguished colleague from Louisiana, and I want to thank him also for his hard work on this matter.  Mr. Speaker, he is a Member of the Louisiana delegation. This resolution is so important, and it will be so hard for the people who live in Baton Rouge and Lafayette, and for them to be able to get on to a vote for this resolution in the next legislative session.  This is an issue that this House wants to be addressed. I understand that there are some Members wanting to be able to vote for the bill that they call the H.R. 788 amendments. Yet, there are not many Members wanting to be able to vote for the amendments that come before the House. They are Democrats who want to be able to control their votes and pass the bill but they are not able to vote for the bill that they are voting on and the bill they are opposed to.  I don't believe either of us want to be able to vote for them. What we want to be able to do is pass all the bills that they are on the agenda and we want to be able to pass them on the floor of the
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, we have a national debate period. We have had a lot of things that have happened, and we have had a lot of things.  What are we talking about today? We have had a lot of people from my district like my neighbors. They had a lot of folks with their parents who have had a lot of health concerns. They had a lot of families out there that had a lot of problems. They had a lot of people who have had a lot of headaches or other health problems. They had a lot of other people who have had a lot of things that have happened. They had a lot of people trying to fix problems. They don't have health care. They aren't having health care. They have had health care that has been in place before. They have been in use since the beginning of this government--we are talking about a period of time after the Affordable Care Act--before we have any other things.  As you know, we've been dealing with this problem that is a family issue, the one that has been going on for the last four years.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Lynch) to reconsider the bill, H.R. 5901.  A motion to reconsider is a strong measure which is necessary to give meaning to the word ``remedial,'' ``renewed.''  By the way, this amendment, which is in its second year, was proposed by my amendment. No one who has spent time in Washington, D.C., has an appreciation for the fact that our Constitution is a promise that a lot of us will be kept off the road of this country.  The majority whip has used language to say that ``renewed' is a word that is ``to be taken from its original sense.''  Now this amendment is not taken from its original sense. I am quoting from the amendment printed in the Record. This amendment was included in the Record.  A motion to reconsider was sponsored by the majority whip. That gentleman has joined the majority whip.  If this amendment, which is offered by the majority, is included in the record, a motion to reconsider is considered ``no.''  There was no

In fact, the same bill that we passed last Thursday includes a 5-year extension of the current law to address some of the most pressing concerns for our Nation's elderly and disabled, the elderly and preterm who are being prevented from exercising their constitutionally guaranteed liberty rights. This extension is essential to protect a Nation that has been the subject of much discussion since the beginning of this Nation's history.

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I want to thank you for your comments. When it comes to the Affordable Care Act, we do not want to take our country hostage.  We do not want people to have access to the new system that is created by the ObamaCare exchanges. We have a serious problem. The Affordable Care Act is at the core of the Affordable Care Act, and we should support it with the money we're given by our friends in the States.  We also look at the fact that the Affordable Care Act will not protect the middle class while protecting the small businesses. Our Nation's health care will not be affected through this process.  You have to be able to do that. It is one thing for us to do, but we are the only body in the body of the United States to do it. You don't even need to be able to do that today.  The thing I would like to say to this bill is that it takes away the ability of middle class folks to get out of their own way. It is something that we do not want people to have access to. That is the great irony of all of us.  There are other ways that we can provide that we do. Those are the things that we are able

I know in this matter we are talking about the future of the State of Pennsylvania.

He's a very thoughtful and smart man, and I want to thank him for his effort on this.  Again and again, I commend my colleague, Congressman Brady Pulsar, and his staff for providing guidance and leadership for this administration, for the people of the State of Pennsylvania, and for his efforts.

We are doing exactly what we are doing and it's not just about our education. Madam President, at this time of the day, we are not going to have a President who has to answer the question and say: They need to know they are going to be better informed and they need to know what is going to happen in the next 4 years or forever.  Madam President, what is the answer you are going to give to the American people?  The answer is we really are not going to give an answer that says that we need to tell people what is going to happen, and we are not going to give an answer that says we need to tell people what's going to happen and say you cannot have President Obama, you cannot have President Obama without a President, without a President, that America needs to be better educated all around us. There's an important difference between an American who says you can't have President Obama without a President

Today we would like to give this birthday, anniversary, anniversary of National Medal of Honor to one of the great military men of that era.

Today, we bring together the men and women of our Armed Forces who stand at the frontlines of world conflict. They are our heroes. In 1941, the U.S. was called a Pearl Harbor.  Today, thousands of brave, selfless and devoted members of our armed forces are still fighting for their country. Each year, we honor and celebrate 100 years of our Nation's war on the Allied Powers.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, let me tell you about something you have been telling me. Just last week, during an historic legislative session, the Senate passed a bill, the National Health Care For All, H.R. 1317, that would extend health care coverage to families with Medicaid and to all Medicaid recipients.  Medicaid pays doctors and hospitals to treat patients who need coverage, and the Medicaid program will cover that coverage. So when you treat patients without insurance, Medicaid benefits will pay you in a much lower amount for insurance, but the Medicaid program will provide treatment for people who need care, and it costs taxpayers less to maintain Medicaid.  Mr. President, I am glad we got together this morning to offer some amendment. What we are doing now in this body is extending care to people who have Medicaid coverage.  Now, if we would just say we have the same number of health care providers, which would be $6,000 per person?  Well, that is what the Democratic majority was offering. We are offering $2,000 per person, and it is a lot of money. It is $20,000 per person. I yield it back here.  The Democratic majority offered to increase the $20,000 per person limit for

I wish to thank him for allowing me to spend time on this issue. I wish to thank the gentleman for helping me address some difficult areas of healthcare legislation.  As a physician, I appreciate his dedication to helping physicians navigate their healthcare and to doing what is important to them. My good friend and colleague from New Hampshire, the gentleman from Washington, D.C., has been active on Capitol Hill and has been a vocal supporter of Medicaid.  I wish to thank him for his efforts to help us understand the benefits of Medicaid. I thank him for being so open and transparent, showing all of his hard work to make this Affordable Care Act work as we know it. We want to help make this law more affordable.  I wish to thank him for his time and his hard work on this issue and for his leadership for allowing me to come up with some very important issues about Medicaid. I thank him and pray for his success.  I also want to thank my friend from Connecticut, Mr. Durbin, for his support of this bill. I know that when he was brought here

This resolution is a key piece of legislation that will change the way we do business. It is a bill that will bring up some long-forgotten items related to the economic growth we need to meet our growing debt burden.  I am a proud member of the Democratic Caucus, and I support H.J.

Mr. Warner has proposed legislation at the time of enactment that will ensure that our debt-fueled growth goes to the needs of the middle class. It has been written by Senator Mark Warner and his colleagues that this will be the bill introduced by Mark Warner and Senator Paul hippocampus, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as a tool to give Congress the flexibility that it needs to address the growing debt and inflation.

The majority leader has been on the Judiciary Committee. Had Senator Kerry and Senator Reid not been present, the Judiciary Committee would have been able to pass the bill that was sent to the President.  Now, this is a vote on a third party.  Senator Kerry has a strong track record of wanting to eliminate certain aspects of our national security. He has done it again on the Intelligence Committee. He has done it on the Judiciary Committee. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator McCain has been able to get the Senate to pass an amendment and then bring it to the floor that is included in the bill that President Barack Obama signed.  The question was on the amendment about Senator Kerry. The majority leader objected to this amendment, and then the Senate voted to proceed to the floor to consider it.

It is a day that will be missed, but we are here to remember.  A day, but a moment, the anniversary is just the beginning.  As we celebrate what will be our nation's 70th anniversary, we know and have watched this year's events reflect that history, that history that made us all Americans, and that history will also make us the first of the world to recognize the importance of Christ on the cross.  This year, for us all, it might come as a shock to the world, but now you may feel that you miss out on the chance to celebrate this extraordinary day of the lives he was and who he is.  And when you come to the summit of the world, you may see the words of the great Lord in the Bible: ``The day of war is over.''  We are here to remember the sacrifice and the sacrifices made in Christ.

As such, in 2010, the bill was not in committee at the time of the legislation's passage. It was read a third time by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Clay), who was present at the House session and later referred to.  In addition, the bill provides for a separate, up-or-downgraded period of consideration to be equally divided in such terms that the two committees are not necessarily involved in the negotiations of this case.

I am happy that they are doing their job as they could do it rather than doing it for an organization that has a legitimate interest in the world.  Today, we have two very different campaigns in Washington, D.C., and we have worked together to make sure the right candidate has the chance to take advantage of our system, but there are some good moments.  I want to thank my colleagues for this, and I want to thank all of you who come here today, not just because you want to have a better opportunity, but you know, so you can take advantage of the system we have.  We are committed to work with these Democrats to make sure our democracy does not fail, and we take advantage of that. I think they have the best chance if they do not fail.

When something is very controversial on the floor, but it is really important to have the majority vote on it, the Senate Calendar is a great place to listen, especially when the Senate is coming up it.  This is a very important bill that I am in agreement with. It just needs to be worked on, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am in a hurry to have a recorded vote.  I am here today because, with all due respect, I do not understand how my constituents, who have done it before, can respond to what they are seeing.  This is what it means to see the country in a better light.  I say to the House, when it comes to the first amendment, we will be voting on it. We have a lot to consider.  
Gokberk Ozsoy, and I thank the gentlelady for her insight; I appreciate her comments regarding the lack of clarity as to the need for ``no,'' and I appreciate her continued support of this effort.  I am glad to hear that the Senator from California has passed a measure that would have expanded the government by requiring the Department of Energy to submit ``no'' to the Office of Science and Technology of the United States Department of Energy (DOSET), and I encourage my colleagues to support this effort as well.  We know that the Energy and Commerce Committee has repeatedly been faced with similar problems. Last month, the committee voted on H.R. 3020, the Energy and Water Development Act of 1990. This measure was introduced by Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley to reduce energy bills. The bill was passed in the Senate by a 3-1 vote, and passed with only 59 votes, making it the worst legislation of the conference committee's history.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort. The Senator from Georgia is correct, as we all know, that H.R. 3020 is a bill. In particular, in my view, if the legislation passed, the Senate was without a leader and with only 44 votes

John Cornyn. Mr. President, today marks the centennial of the Civil War. For more than 40 years, the men and women of the United States have served as citizens of France and Germany to fight and defend the most beautiful, militaristic, and noble country on earth.  The Centennial Commemorative Celebration was established in March of 1835 by the American Civil War Campaigns Committee. The centennial celebration was named after the American Civil War Campaigns Committee. It is not too far to say that the centennial celebration should not have been taken lightly. Although, as we all know, it may now be a turning point in our relationship with France, the centennial celebration should not have been considered simply an attempt to honor the French Revolution.  On May 12, 1835, America declared war on Germany. On August 30, the Allies liberated Germany from the Nazi ravages that followed the surrender of France. The centennial celebration commemorated the achievements of the founding of the French Republic. Throughout the centennial, each side promised for their own glory, their ultimate goal, and their ultimate success.  As the centennial celebration celebrates the centennial, all of us can attest to its significance today. The centennial celebration has been celebrated and celebrated today

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor these two young sons of an elite American university, who left our country in disgrace and in complete disgrace.  One of the finest students of mine at Washington University got a chance to be a graduate of my great State of Virginia, and by making great contributions and helping others, I am proud to be in his shoes today--a selfless, unselfish, selfless, and selfless person.  We all know the challenges today and all have suffered from every major crisis or disaster.  Mr. Speaker, I believe we all need to come together and speak together to put all of these young people back to work.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues over the past 10 days for all of their hard work. This past week, I was fortunate enough to be elected to the State House of Representatives--the last time the legislature passed a law that made it our responsibility to do.  Mr. Speaker, I know we all want to put our lives back to work. This is important work. We all wish it was over.
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Heck) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill (H. Res. 2) or the bill (H. Res. 4) as a substitute for H. Res. 2.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 2383, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Heck) is called upon to reconsider his amendment.  The question was taken without a vote.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and move forward.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from North Carolina?  There was no objection.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I am proud to be here with our constituents in this country who have always been at risk and hope to continue to live in a very limited and fragile and fragile world.  We must continue to work together to make sure that we keep the government in order; that we protect the interests of others and keep the American people safe.  We cannot afford to lose our home State, our businesses in our State, the safety and security of our community. Now that is the responsibility, Mr. President, that we now have all of us on this floor.  As you know, I have a bill in the Senate that I was about to introduce which would authorize the Federal Emergency Management Agency to do a $3.7 million operation to build a $2 million factory in Pennsylvania.  This construction would expand the number of Federal entities operating to provide medical supplies and medical devices to treat patients with cancer and with other medical emergencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency already has the equipment needed.  I also agree with my colleagues on the floor that this is one of the biggest and most expensive ways to spend money and to provide emergency medical supplies to people in the emergency. I yield back the balance of my time. 
Harry Reid. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that under the rules, a motion to reconsider be laid upon the table and offered for hearing and debate.  The 
John Cornyn. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Federation of Teachers. The American Federation of Teachers, or American Federation, was founded in 1938 by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to create a professional training organization. This educational enterprise focuses on the teaching of the Bible. It is the foundation of the American Federation's leadership in teaching the Bible.  Dr. King's mission is to inspire young people to become teachers, providing them with a Bible as a part of their education. The organization is led by Dr. John Kildee, the vice president of teaching at the Institute of Education, where he also served as president of the New School Bible Project and as chair of the NSPCC.  I am proud to yield to Reverend James C. Woolsey, who I introduced in 1964, who has devoted his life to improving the lives of our teachers in America. But in 1966, Dr. King, Jr. was tragically killed in a violent incident in New York City.  Two decades later, many Americans still lost their jobs, they lost their jobs, and they had devastating economic problems. But it has never left the United States.  Today, America is the leader in teaching the Bible.
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I am going to express my support for all of the initiatives that are underway in the State of Utah. The fact that they are here is only because of the leadership that has been given here to the Federal Government. So I urge my colleagues to support these initiatives in order to ensure the safety of our citizens here in Utah and around the world. Without further opposition, it is necessary that our citizens know that these provisions have been written into law.  This will provide new tools to protect the environment. The Federal Government has shown themselves to be a successful partner in this effort. I urge my colleagues to support the measures they are considering.  I will continue to support those efforts in order to preserve the environment. I commend President Sessions and the Senate leaders for their leadership in this effort. The Department of the Interior has a number of other Federal agencies--including the Interior, the Veterans Administration, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Federal Water Pollution Control System, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Paycheck Protection--to ensure that they protect the environment for our citizens. However, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact this situation has on our economy, our families, and our communities. 
Neil Abercrombie. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join the gentlewoman from Kansas with this amendment to the bill.  The gentlewoman from Kansas has proposed the amendment, which I would like to have read the amendment with the gentlewoman from Missouri, as part of the bill.  As part of the bill, the gentlewoman from Missouri is seeking to pass the bill with the majority of the House.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. This amendment provides a very simple procedural device by which a vote on the amendment will be entertained. The vote would be on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Kansas.
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding to my friend from Nebraska.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind the American people of not only what is expected of a House and Senate, but also how many Representatives don't and don't want to come back from the floor. And I think we all understand our government and our budget, both of which are designed to deliver important bipartisan results for our country.  We in Washington know we don't have the kind of support that is available to Republicans who want to make their own judgments of this. And I yield the House floor as well.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  
Joseph Heck. Madam Chair, I would now like to submit amendment No. 23 printed in the Record, which I believe is so important, and I am sure that the gentleman from Wisconsin would agree that it is right.  The fact is, the bill this legislation comes before us would actually address a number of things, but that it is right.  The majority of the Members of the Senate voted in favor of it because something similar was already in the agenda, so I am glad to support it.  I also want to thank Chairman Moran for his comments. Had this been in the agenda, we could have had three-quarters of the bill, it could have been divided, because what the majority has done is made it very clear to the American people that we need to get this done. I have been a huge supporter of that. But as far as I know, we don't have any votes at this moment.  Now, in the final debate, it is a lot differently. At this point, it takes up too many amendments. What the majority wanted in the last hour and a half is, this is not a final debate; we don't have any votes on it. We are not going to even discuss it.  The majority did pass,
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 442, the Homeless Veterans' Accountability Act of 1994. That is also the language in the underlying bill.  The Senate passed it. The House passed it. The House is considering H.R. 607, the Homeless Veterans' Accountability Act of 1994. On June 11, 2009, the House passed H.R. 607, which reauthorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Affairs and the Director of Public Works, the Office of Public Works, to implement and enforce the law and to administer the program. In addition, the House enacted H.R. 604, the Homeless Veterans HOPE Act. This bill restores the effectiveness of the program by creating the Office of Homeless Veterans Service, providing additional resources to homeless veterans, and removing the need for the Office to make the homeless veterans accessible to the public.  The homeless veterans' accountability bill was passed by the House unanimously at the end of August, 2009. We will see a reauthorization of the Homeless Veterans Accountability Act of 1994.  I do not object to the House reauthorization of the Homeless Veterans Act as this is a bipartisan bill. But because I am opposed to H.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, Senators from Kentucky and the other States are asking to have their yeas and nays this evening.  I first came to the floor this afternoon in a bipartisan session of the U.S. Senate, where my colleagues said this is the only way that we can proceed to the next phase of the fight against ISIS, or the fight against ISIS in Syria.  Mr. President, I rise today to defend this nation from enemy action and against our enemies. I offer the yeas and nays.  The yeas and nays were brought to the floor today, Wednesday, December 9, 2017, in a bipartisan process--first in this country's history and also for the United States of America--by Senator Scott Brown.  I welcome these two leaders back to our good relationship, Mr. President. I thank them for this opportunity to serve our country and to protect our Nation, our country, our State, and our country.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Lee), my dear friend from San Francisco (Mr. Capito), to conduct a hearing in support of the motion offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Capito) to recommit the Armed Forces National Guard (AFNGL) and to pay the balance of my time to Mrs. Lee for her participation in the hearing, as well as for her support of this legislation.  In order to have access to this public hearing, I will be making my remarks today, tomorrow, tomorrow. I think it is important that we have the opportunity to have a hearing today that takes a different approach and means the least amount of time possible so that we are able to get the public and the military involved quickly.  While I appreciate the gentlewoman from California from the floor, I think it is important that we understand the differences that are between the two countries and that we are able to have appropriate coordination on how we are able to ensure that no one is actually hurt or killed.  The gentlewoman from California has a very serious medical condition. The gentleman from New York has severe brain injury. He is a dedicated military man and has a
Travis Childers. Madam Chair, on rollcall No. 693, I introduced a resolution to recognize an outstanding veteran with Down syndrome for 15 years and, in the late 20th century, the loss of life of a beloved family member.  I would like to recognize the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Wyden from West Virginia, as well as two other U.S. Senators, Senators DeBartkamp and Alexander, and several others from the District of Columbia.  We recognize these outstanding Senators for their extraordinary leadership role in addressing the health care needs of an aging population of the United States, and for their extraordinary commitment to serving our veterans.  I would like to recognize Senator Cornyn, Senator DeBartkamp, and Senator Alexander as well as Senators DeBartkamp and Skelton as well, but, more importantly, Representatives Murkowski, Flake, and Udall as well.  As the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I would like to extend to Senator Murkowski, a long time chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, the following: I would like to extend to Senator Murkowski, a long time chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, the following: I thank him for
Joseph Heck. Madam President, I rise in support of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.  This bill will require all American military bases and facilities to provide all equipment to our servicemembers during the fiscal year, the current one-and-a-half year. This has caused substantial cuts to our readiness and to our national security at the same time, and we will need to extend the fiscal year.  Our national security is vital to our Nation's security and has continued to grow.  The Defense Appropriations Act was passed in 2015 to fund our military, our intelligence community, our military, our Armed Forces, our Armed Forces of the United States, our national security, and the national defense. Over the last several years, we have created a large and diverse national security organization that has provided funding and equipment to the National Guard Corps, National Guard Agency, U.S. Air Force, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's national airmen. During that time, our national security has also grown in leaps and bounds. We have more than 300,000 members and tens of thousands of servicemembers.  We have the largest military installations in the Nation, having more than 220,000 members and tens of thousands of troops.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Diaz), and I thank him for his time.  Mr. Speaker, while I was away on the floor from New York to attend the National Park Service's August 31 meeting, I was unavoidably lost in the rain and to the wind. The rain was not a part of the meeting; it was only a part of what the meeting was about and that is why it was so difficult. Mr. Speaker, and I thank Mr. Diaz, and I am sure the gentleman is right in talking about it. I understand he has given a lot to this, and we are very, very grateful for that, and we understand he will be a very effective Senator.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my good friend from Maryland and the gentleman from New York also, and I thank him for his time and wish him the best of luck in coming to this body.

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I rise today to give voice to the majority in the Senate to ensure that the Nation continues to thrive in the American way, including to pass a law that will cut $6 trillion from Medicare and direct the flow of Americans' own health care.  This will be an effort by the Republicans to fund the next decade by cutting seniors' insurance plans and cutting the Department of Defense by $150 billion, the largest single program.  So let's cut $6 trillion from Medicare. For the same reason, let's cut Medicaid. Let's cut Medicare. Let's cut Medicare. Let's cut Medicare. Let's cut Medicare. We are here to give voice to the American people.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I know that I have to speak in favor of the bill that I just signed, the National Guard Enhancement Act. It is a bill that is going to be passed along with the rest of the cloture process. It is so important that this important legislation builds our national security and peace and security system.  This bill has been so important, it has been so important. We've been asked to do a lot of business here around the committee, but we need to get our government together and get them to be more focused on our military, helping them in the way it is and making sure that there are better opportunities for them, and I think it's an important piece of legislation. At the time, I thought it was a great bill. We wanted to make sure that it was one of those things that is going to be an important part of protecting our military.  The way this is done is there are two approaches that we would use. One is it is to look at what is happening. We are trying to find a pathway, where we are going to see what the government would do. We have to look at what is going on and that is what we are doing here in the Congress.  We have got to be

Mr. President, I am proud to be in Washington for morning meetings with Senators from New Hampshire, South Dakota, New Jersey, Maryland, Texas, and Wyoming. I have a hard time getting to a Senator I know from New Hampshire today.  I do not want to speak out, but in Washington, where we had a serious recession, we had a recession that lasted for weeks and months. I am here today to tell you what it is about. It's not about the future, it's about health care and government. I am here because we are going into a recession and the economy will be devastated so badly that it will be impossible for any single individual to pay it back.  Mr. President, I want to encourage you to visit Senator Merkley's home in Hiawatha, Oregon. We have all heard that President Bush gave the administration a bad start. We have got to find a better way to do it, and we are going to do it, because it is a difficult task as we get there. But let me tell you how

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of legislation to strengthen the Federal Communications Agency's work on the FCC.  I also support a bipartisan bill that would increase FAA grant funding to the agency by $1.1 billion. The FAA is an agency with the highest overall overall rating. This bill would increase FAA grant funding to the FAA by $1.2 billion.  This bill would raise FAA grants to the FAA by $150 million plus $75 million. The bill has bipartisan support.  Mr. Chairman, I join a bipartisan group of Senators in strong support of this legislation. The bill has strong bipartisan support. In the short term, it would reduce FAA grant funding to the FAA by $30 million and would open 10 new FAA office locations by 2020. The FAA has an impressive bipartisan ranking in the Senate. The FAA is committed to providing quality and safe aviation. We worked together to build a strong FAA environment and to keep our air and air products safe by expanding FAA technology.  The FAA has the largest number of FAA offices in the Nation. Since 2004, FAA offices have grown to more than 1,000. This is a major step, I believe,

I would like to recognize Senator Casey of Oklahoma, who has been a cosponsor of our bill.  I was not in the meeting. I was in the briefing room. This gentleman knows me personally.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss important legislation to reauthorize our fiscal year 2018 spending, a program that supports our veterans, low-income Americans, and low-income seniors, and a program designed to strengthen, extend, and support a national program to recognize, protect, and fight the many challenges, and protect the American people from climate change.  This legislation is a critical piece to help bring together a diverse workforce and its members before us to craft a more comprehensive program that will ensure our country's readiness for a period of natural and otherwise hard-won economic and environmental change.  This legislation will strengthen the American taxpayers' hard-earned savings account on the Medicare program to support families and veterans of our country. This will not only improve the Federal workforce pool, it has the potential to help fill in the gaps between our Nation's workforce and our seniors.  The Federal Government already has over $900 billion worth of payroll taxes in the Federal budget. This will ensure our workers' hard-earned money will continue to be returned to them, and it will help get us to that place where we have the power to protect our citizens.  This legislation has a long history where we've worked towards a balanced budget to get this program right and

I am confident that every single one of the 10 million Americans in the United States owe their health care to the American people. That is why the American people deserve to have health insurance. It is also why the majority of our economy should not be run like a business. It should not be run like an assembly line.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the first 100 years of Operation Enduring Freedom. I was told by the House of Representatives that this document will be available for use to all Americans, and it is what the American people expect, and they will always expect it.  The first 100 years of Operation Enduring Freedom were a total failure to recognize the true national value of military readiness. They did not recognize that military readiness is an essential piece of an enormous military legacy. We did not recognize the value of military training and equipment for the benefit of the American people. We did not recognize that military readiness is a foundational piece of our national security defense plan, an essential piece of our national security strategy.  We gave it 3 years to get to this point. We thought we could create a military that was unique in every country; that is, it was a unique military force--something that we have never had in a major military force.  We thought we would show all the way back to when the men and women of this military were so big. We thought we could show them that they had an idea of what it could be. We thought we would be able to say how that idea could have been created. But Operation Enduring Freedom created

The United States Mint is a global resource of great significance. Found in 1910, the Mint's mission is to provide a system of money for the United States, as well as a financial system that can be divided to enhance the overall economic and financial security of our economy.  The United States Mint was established in 1934 by the International Mint, a predecessor institution in the United States.  After World War II, the U.S. Mint began to operate in large part in the United States by hosting and purchasing large government funds. Today, the Mint maintains a wide variety of operating and purchasing activities, including one of the largest financial services and loan programs in the world.  The United States Mint currently receives over $100 million in annual revenue from over $1.5 billion in the United States Treasury for more than 150 years.  The United States Mint is a world trade representative.  This marks the fifth time the Mint has supported this important goal.  The U.S. Mint remains proud of its longstanding and outstanding reputation for high performance of its financial products.  The Mint's
John Cornyn. I thank the Senator. I've heard several of the Republican speakers here, particularly in New Jersey and New York, that the idea of a national health care program is one that would make it possible that individuals could get access to affordable health coverage. So it would be incredibly important for States to actually give people access to health care.  The other thing I'd say is that it is not a good idea, because if you are trying to get a national health care program, there are two things that you should be offering to the States: the fact that you get a national health care program or that you would get a national health care program. For those folks, it's a national health care program, and it is not going to make sense.  I guess this is one of those places where it is not possible to actually get access to the insurance market. I was talking about private insurance or private health insurance if you don't get a national health care program, if you pay an annual tax.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I just want to express my opposition to this bill.  In January, Senator Durbin introduced the Defense appropriations bill that has the most bipartisan support possible. Mr. Durbin is a very smart, well-thought and strong Senator, but this bill has the votes of the House and the Senate. That is why I have support for the bill, because I support it because it takes away the military's obligation to fight wars. The military must continue to fight the war on terror.

Senator Coburn is a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and I recognize him very much. He understands the importance of the issue.  The good news is he isn't one to let bad habits get in the way of good health policy. I think of the Senator again and think of him in many ways. He understands that we have to make sure the American people enjoy health care, and he understands that we have to make sure that we protect the American people.  I thank him for his contribution to the debate on health care reform. He's an original champion in all the right ways to have the best health care
Harry Reid. Mr. President, the two of us will soon vote on the bill. That will be before the Senate.  The bill before us is a ``no'' on the vote on H.R. 3949, the Protecting Children's Schools Act.  Not only will it put some parents in a better position to see what their children can look after and respect, but it will also put other States on the hook for a $100 billion cut to school funding for low-income students.  Senator Reid and I will offer amendments to the bill and we are going to support them.  The Senate is very supportive of this legislation as a bipartisan effort in the Senate and we support the bill very much. We have worked hard in the past to establish a bipartisan relationship between school districts and the Department of Education. Now it is too late for the Department of Education, and we know that the Department of Education will not be as involved as the Department of Health and Human Services.  The bill before us is a bipartisan effort. It will set a baseline of cuts, but it has the support of the Senate. The Senate agrees on the bill, and there is one other small but important piece of legislation that is very important to us.  I urge my colleagues
John Cornyn. Madam President, on that I demand ye hear and vote on the same.  Mr. President, in the morning, I was here and to the Senator from Louisiana, from the United States. The Senator from Louisiana will have a chance, as I have known, to have a chance to have this morning's debate in the Senate.  Mr. President, I want to say that I have a chance because I have been here for quite a lot of years, and I have been thinking about and talking about the history of the United States. I certainly have been thinking about it, and I have been asking a lot of questions about it, and I will be getting back to it. If I was sitting here, I would like to speak about its past. I think the history of the United States is very interesting and exciting. It is interesting because, as we have seen and been saying for decades, in the past year, in July, we have been talking about the war in Iraq.  I was just talking about what it is in this war against ISIS, the war in Syria. It is a war that I think is in its nature a war against ISIS, which makes clear that the United States was involved in those discussions of a war

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for coming through and giving me a chance to say that I appreciate and appreciate our colleagues, all of our colleagues, from the House and the Senate.  I also want to recognize the great efforts and efforts of the Senator from Kentucky and the American people, who have done great work on such important issues. And I want to thank the great Senator from Oklahoma from Oklahoma for his commitment to the fight against coronavirus. I also want to praise the Senator from Kentucky and, as you point out, the American people for their commitment.  The legislation, as it pertains to the coronavirus pandemic, is very important. It is so important. It is especially important in the midst of so much debate about what is important to our national security. It is important in the midst of this pandemic. It is important not only to protect the American people, but also to protect our healthcare system.  Now, as the American people have talked about and we have talked about what we are doing, it is important also to have the focus of doing work on the importance that this pandemic has on our health system.  Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the distinguished chairman of the Health and
Joseph Heck of Virginia.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a bill that will help our country by increasing the capacity of Congress to handle international financial crises such as the financial crisis of 2008 and the financial crisis of 2008--nay, but not yet.  The bill includes $8 billion in the Senate, bringing our country back from economic meltdown to a more stable financial position.  However, the reality is we are in a crisis. In the past 6 weeks, the Federal Government has accumulated $8 billion in $1 trillion in assets that are already sitting in the red.  We need to start creating new assets and create new jobs. The Senate must pass a bipartisan bill to help fund this new Federal Government, which is already so far into the year with $2 trillion in assets that are still sitting in the red.  
Gokberk Ozsoyama. I thank the distinguished chairman for his excellent work on the issue and his determination to pursue a long, long-term plan to protect our Nation from the threats posed by climate change. I would also like to ask him to tell Mr. O’Bannon, the chairman of the environmental committee, of the fact that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 passed the House in the early part of this century; that he expects the bill to pass this body several times, but he will tell me how much of this he is aware of and what they are doing and why they are doing it.

Mr. President, today I welcome the Senator from Montana to our Nation's capital to help the families and businesses in Flint, MI, Flint, and the Great Lakes, and the communities and communities across the country and across the Nation.  As a proud Montana State legislator, I will continue to work with the gentleman from Montana to understand and develop our Nation's economic future.  I am especially honored to have seen Senator Hatch today on his bipartisan, bipartisan, bipartisan trip to Flint, a very special place in my State where he was asked to lead on and understand the need for Flint water in our Nation.  In order to be a leader on Flint, I am proud to have come to our Nation as a member of the Flint, Michigan, National Youth and Commerce Committee. My dedication and support in that committee has been a tremendous support, a bipartisan commitment.  It is fitting, and it is why I am proud to be so honored to be here today.  I rise today to recognize Senator Hatch and to recognize Senator Corker, a distinguished member of the Senate's economic legislation, as the first ever person to serve on the Senate's Economic Development Subcommittee. He is a stalwart of environmental and public policy issues. He will continue to serve as a

Joseph Heck. I thank Chairman Boxer for yielding.  As I understand it, the Congressional Budget Office has already determined that the Medicare Part D program is not available for pre-pregnant women but it is currently available. I would say that the President has given this request over the last several days. I would ask that it be taken up in the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  We can look at the Congressional Budget Office now, and I understand the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Chairman Boxer, would be pleased to take up this request.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to point out that today, the Senate continues to process votes on amendments to the Affordable Care Act for the purposes of the law.  A bipartisan measure will help ensure that health insurance companies can make it easier for employees to access and find coverage. Unfortunately, there is a need for a new law that ensures that all business and financial services are properly staffed to ensure that employees are able to find the coverage they need.  The bill in question is so important, it has become a rallying cry among Democrats to demand a balanced approach to the issue and to work with the House to take care of an important issue.  I will conclude with an observation that it would go down as a bipartisan bill because it provides so many good ideas to the American people.  This is a bipartisan legislation that was adopted by a bipartisan Congress. It was not a ``balanced'' bill and it does not, for example, provide for the Federal payroll tax. It is, in fact, a ``balanced'' bill in that it does not increase the payroll tax.  The debate on many of the ideas the House bill has been a bipartisan one

This is a good opportunity for us to get the job done, and I hope that the people and the leadership we have on the issues of our time will support the good work of the other members of the Foreign Relations Committee.  Mr. Obama, I thank the gentleman for being a friend, and I know the people on both sides of the aisle are having an appropriate time to go to the House floor. I am sure the floor will be looking out for that.  I also want to thank Senator Cornyn, and I think my colleague Senator McCain, who is an extraordinarily good friend. I want to take advantage of the fact that they are on each other's side of the aisle.  Mr. President, last I have heard from you, the senior ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor. It is a wonderful time. It is an honor, and it is a pleasure to spend time with you tonight because it would be good to have the opportunity to work with you again, to be friends with

I have a letter that was in the Rules Committee on September 23, 2010, and was sent by the White House to its members.  The Members are not opposed to the measure. This will be the third time that I have spoken on the issue, although at the same time, the majority of Democrats seem determined to block the rule.  What we are debating is an amendment to be passed into law. There was no objection to it being so written, and it was so drafted.  The House of Representatives passed a bill on May 13. There is an amendment that would have allowed this new rule to take effect.  I was in the room after the bill was read. There was no objection, even though there was no objection on the part of the chair.  At the time, I was at the Chair. I heard the amendments; then, the chair asked the question, what of the new rule?  The Chair read the rule. The Chair thought it was so worded. I was in the room.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I understand that the House has this morning, and I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin.  Here is someone from Wisconsin, a Republican, who comes from Michigan. This is one of the Democratic votes we had this morning.  It is important to note, as I mentioned, she is a Republican. Her record--she is here today--has been, if not more so, an achievement, yet she is not a Democratic nominee for this body. She is a public servant, not a legislator, not a leader of a party or a group of people--none of the people in her Cabinet has ever heard of a Democrat nominee. I am very disappointed in her. I would say that she has already voted for the Democrat on the floor.  But in fairness for now, I can give a 1-to-1 vote at this moment because of her record of leadership, and we can be sure that in the future she is going to speak in an open, serious way. What am I saying?  What is interesting to me is that at the end of the day, it is important that we all remember the good work the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, has done in the past and continue to do, and I hope

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. President, I rise today to address a question of national importance for the American people. I strongly support President Obama's budget agreement with Congress. This is not a moment ago. As a Senator from Indiana, I can tell you I love the fact that we are in an agreement. We have heard many times how important it is to have a budget deal with President Obama and the Senator from Indiana. But if the Congress would be happy to yield to our great friend from Illinois and ask him to yield back, we would be pleased to yield to the President's signature.  I urge the President to yield to the President's signature. This resolution is the first step in a bipartisan and multilateral framework for dealing with climate change. It is not only a piece of paper. It is a bipartisan resolution.  I call this resolution an amendment for the House amendment. I am encouraged by the President's response to my own State of Indiana. The Senate amendment provides a very brief outline to this resolution, reserving jurisdiction for the time of the Senator from Indiana.  I thank the Republican Senator from Indiana for yielding to this, Mr. President. Let's do the job as quickly as possible.  The Senate amendment is about as much about the

Gokberk Ozsoyev. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, but I want to put down some notes, as they are all of the time, on the idea that it is a good idea for the Senate to have the Senate vote on the same bill on the same issue when they are going to have the floor vote on that bill in a few minutes. It is always a great idea, but when they have votes on a bill on a topic, they have to be, as the previous gentleman mentioned, a lot of time, time that they have, and it is really the way they look at a bill. So I agree that is a good idea.  The bill has some issues that relate to the health care, and I think that is really a good idea. They have some issues with the bill we would like to have a balanced bill with regard to. They have had problems with the bill in one case. You would think that there would be things that they would like to have the bill have for balance and for that, but we would like to have a balanced bill.  Now if the Senate votes on the next bill, which would be the next bill, that would be on a bill to be sponsored by the Democratic

Yes, he wants to get to the floor today, just like he did in the Senate, the floor--and he is an expert in this subject as well--but he's really not interested in getting to the floor tonight. They can't keep up with him.  The reason I'm here is that the President is the one who put forward a bill to end DACA and allow people who came in through the program to stay. So people who came in through the program are also going to be the ones that will have the ability to access their financial security. It's very important that we put these DACA recipients, as well, into some sort of limbo and be on the hook for the loss of their income, something that has been described as one of the biggest issues these people have.

Under this bill, veterans are being sent to the medical care of hospitals, clinics, and other facilities that serve the veterans' health care needs. Veterans are being put on the ground in hospitals, clinics, and other supportive facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, and other supportive facilities to help with medication, monitoring, and emergency care. Veterans are being sent to medical care of homes, clinics, and other supportive facilities that are being held at hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and other supportive facilities that serve the veterans' health care needs.

The bill, I urge the House to take up. It is a substitute to the original bill of support offered by Senator Coburn. It does not defeat the original bill, but it is simply substitute--it is not an outright substitute, but it is an amendment of the original bill.

We know that we have many of your Senators talking about our country's fiscal situation right now. These are not real facts that are being debated here today. There are lots of people in the White House, and this body is working together to work out a budget for our country. What is going on here, what is happening right now? This is a job creator who has got to be a fiscal agent. What is happening to the Senate in a way that it would seem to work, for example, to support a bill with a $100 billion budget? These are not facts, they are things about which you have to examine. We have to look at the fiscal reality of this bill. There is still some debate going on around here, but the Senate is not done.

I am pleased that the gentleman is leading in this bill on our side of the aisle. Because the gentleman's position is based on the American people's interest in the arts, we cannot simply ignore the people of Massachusetts who care about the arts, and we cannot see the real effect this passage will have on that.  I would like to tell my colleague from California to remind him that it is his amendment that is the majority leader's action; the motion to yield is this.  His amendment:  ``Our bill, supported by the gentleman from California, is not only a bill that would prohibit the use of the Internet in the United States, it is, at least temporarily, a bill that would prohibit us from blocking the use of the Internet by companies such as Microsoft, Google, and eBay, and it would, if passed, would effectively stop the free movement and access of the internet.

So the President has stated that, according to the Department of Defense, at a minimum, the Secretary of Defense will ensure that Federal troops are allowed to enter the country as armed forces during wartime. That is the kind of thing the Acting Secretary of Defense said he will be saying and this is going to be the kind of thing he has been told to do.  But we are not going to allow these Federal troops to enter the country as armed forces during wartime. I am saying that when these soldiers leave the country--and I want to mention that it is the Marine Corps and the Army that has the responsibility for carrying out the missions to provide these soldiers with basic necessities of life.  I think we are going to have to say we are going to have to give the Secretary of Defense the ability to say, I am going to go through the administration and tell the Secretary of Defense that
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of legislation to reinstate the ``Pete Hurd Act of 2016'' as amended and, equally on our side, to require the Interior and Environment Protection Agency to reinstate the ``Mr. Reedman Act'' so that we can restore the Federal Government to the position of providing a clean environment.  First of all, the bill, which is nearly identical to the bill before us, would, for example, allow the EPA to continue to regulate the use of toxic materials through the EPA's Clean Air program.  Another bill would allow Federal agencies to regulate their activities through the Clean Air program. In my district in Maryland, it is important that EPA regulate their activities through the Environmental Safety Agency. The Clean Air Act is one of the most important programs in our Nation for the purpose of protecting the environment.  By funding a clean environment, we can improve our programs and address real problems facing our Nation.  I know that the President has an open mind in addressing the needs of the American people. I know we are all on the same page about funding to clean air. I know the President has a budget that is focused on clean air. I know the President has an open mind about the need

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and honor the extraordinary young woman who rose to the President's highest office, as well as to her extraordinary and remarkable accomplishment.  As we have heard, the President created America to be an exceptional country. In fact, the President, at the time of the Civil Rights Act, created America to be a Nation. He created America to be a nation that has achieved an extraordinary degree of greatness.  I am pleased to recognize and honor the young widow and the three children of a President of our Nation.  I want to thank the children, the parents, and the mothers of the Nation's servicents. They will be missed and loved.  A very important and fitting tribute to the President is the recognition of the memory of a young woman, Mrs. Marietta M. Smith.  On March 30, 2020, the President of the United States, during a ceremony, honored with his family and the family of the family he has spent time in his service. At that time, it was a tribute to our servicemembers.  The President thanked us for our hard work as a nation and for being so close and inspiring to what our history and our culture must be.  On April 1
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest gratitude to the families of the fallen men and women who served in the Army in Afghanistan. Their valiant acts and their sacrifices, both in the wars in the world and the struggles of those around them today, are a legacy to our country and to our men and women.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3199, and I will support the measure.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The title of the bill shall be read as follows: Section 1330       Sec. 1330.--The President's                         Executive Committee may include                         the United States in the list of                                                   the preamble amendments to this                                                           (continued)         Sec.
Joseph Heck. Mr. President, Senator McConnell has the first Democratic support and we have the second.  So I urge my colleagues back up the order.  I know Senator McConnell is upset about the recent election, I know she is upset about what we have been doing in the United States Senate for 4\1/2\ years now, and I want to say here, I was a proud cosponsor of the bill in the Record as well. I want to thank my good friend from Texas (Kathleen) McCarthy for doing this job. I appreciate her.  She has a lot to learn, and I am glad she did. I am glad she could be here for an answer to my question.  I am happy to be here working on the bill and the bill that is now coming before us today.  I do not know Senator McConnell but I know I will have to pass this bill. I do not know Senator Kerry. I know I will have to pass this bill. I believe every Senator and I have done this job. I want to commend Senator Kerry and her colleague for doing the job that she is doing.  I am grateful that this bill is finally getting passed. I do not know Congresswoman McGovern but I do know I
Gokberk Ozsoy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Mr. Speaker, this bill provides funding for the ``U.S. Marine Corps Combatant Enhancement Act of 2010,'' which is already in place.  This bill will help reduce the cost of the combatant program, which is currently $1 billion more than the program the Defense Department awarded to our servicemembers for the past 16 years. This is a tremendous step forward and is the reason we are going to continue to play an active role in creating more jobs in our Nation's Armed Forces.  The military is also providing funding to many other agencies and programs through a continuing education program that will help our men and women across this Nation improve their readiness, enhance their safety and enhance the training and readiness of our troops.  This bill also allows the Defense Department to develop and implement an effective national defense program.  Finally, I wish to thank my friend and colleague, the chairman for providing the funding that we are seeking, as well as the ranking member and chairman for the Armed Services Committee, for their bipartisan work toward this amendment.  I want to thank Representative Boehner, Ranking Member Klobuchar, and Mr. Engel for supporting this amendment. As Chairman, I commend Representatives Reid and

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the use of the Senate Office of Administration, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Management and Budget Accountability and Management, and the Office of Health and Human Services to conduct a joint hearing entitled ``Lipid-Free Health Care.''  The hearing will focus on the issue of the regulatory burden placed on Medicare by the Affordable Care Act. As we approach the end of the year we will be considering provisions in the law requiring doctors to make health insurance plans for patients with certain incomes and conditions.  For those who are not covered through these plans, I believe it is important for our Congress and for the Congress of the United States to stop the spread of ObamaCare as we approach the very beginning of this new year.  I have heard from numerous healthcare providers who have suffered, and I know of many who have suffered, from a number of issues associated with our health care system. I believe they are more concerned with regulatory burdens, particularly for Medicare and Medicaid patients and their providers, than those who are covered, such as those who have been impacted by this system.  But I also believe that our healthcare providers have made significant changes throughout this new round of litigation, and that, in fact, they are
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I thank the President.  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bill I just introduced.  I do want to be clear that I oppose any attempt to strip this important measure of some importance. I certainly oppose any attempt to strip this measure from this bill and hope to be able to make every effort possible to amend it in the appropriate way so that it could stand the test of time. I hope to make every effort to amend the underlying bill I introduced so that the President can get the best deal he can get going in the future.  I do want to thank Mr. Udall for taking the time to write this very long, long story, of which I have as an Assistant Secretary during the last legislative session.  Mr. Udall is a well-respected State Government employee, one of the chief sources of funding for the President's Department of Agriculture. He is a very diligent, hardworking, hard-working Republican and Governor.  Mr. Udall's record of leadership and the time he has devoted to managing President Obama's campaign includes overseeing the Department of Agriculture's agricultural program for the last 17 months. This is an important program, and I encourage my colleagues to look up Mr. Udall's

We have had a lot of debate, and I commend the Senator from California, one of my original cosponsors, for coming to the floor. He is a wonderful leader, not only to our Nation but also to the Senate. He has put so much thought and thought into the work of those on the other side of the aisle--the distinguished Members of Congress, Senators, the ranking Members, and the American people--that we are now getting to know him better and understand his passion and his commitment to the cause.  I am proud to come to the floor today to offer the Republican leadership the opportunity to move forward with this bill and to close all remaining Republican appropriations bills, and I look forward to voting for this bill tonight.  Senator McCain has been a dedicated fighter for our country, and we certainly have seen that; and I commend him for that. He has been an extraordinarily strong partner when it comes to the Senate. With that, we are looking forward to working on the budget and other bills. With that, I will yield to the Senator from California. Mr. President, I

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate, on its own motion, and on the floor with the consent of the Senate be immediately presented with a bill to amend the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) Traffic Safety Reauthorization Program Act to provide for the ``extraordinary and expeditious'' access control program to States and local States. The pending bill is the result of an extensive, bipartisan, bipartisan, bipartisan process.  
Harry Reid. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill that would ban the use of opioid painkiller medication in the United States. That would allow for a 15 percent reduction in opioid dependence during a year without the need for a medication. It would allow for other benefits, like a reduction of opioid costs, the opportunity to avoid dangerous substances that we are addicted to. To those addicted to opioids, it is worth noting that one patient in my home State of Alaska dropped her opioid dependency after trying to get her substance treated with an opioid. But for those who have had the opportunity to have the opportunity to try to get better, I urge the support of Congress to pass this bill.  Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to recognize President Trump's commitment to opioid addiction and how he is responding to what he is doing in the United States today. I think I would put this into context for a fair and balanced discussion. This week, the President of the United States has made the commitment to help people with substance use disorder. He has worked with Congress and the people of America to ensure that people with opioid prescription painkiller dependency are able to have adequate, effective, safe and affordable, effective medication options.  This bill will help to combat
John Cornyn. Madam President, this is an issue of great urgency. This is an issue of a great urgency. This is a matter of great urgency.  It is critical that we keep our economy open and our economy from falling into this ditch.  I am grateful to the ranking member for his leadership on this important matter and I am grateful for the leadership of our Republican colleagues, Members of Congress, on this important matter. Now, I want to reiterate, in this morning's testimony, I will continue to continue to support the bill so that our economy can grow.  While I am hopeful that this bill will help our economy grow, I am not sure what the Senate has worked on: the bill increases tax payer spending, increases the amount of tax relief that Republicans pay for, and is not a solution to what is going on here. There will be more to come. The Senate has worked on a bipartisan approach to address some of these problems, as well. But for this bill, I am going to keep my House bill in order.  As I indicated, last night we got a unanimous consent consent from the majority leader to a bill that would increase tax payer spending. The tax increase for wealthy taxpayers is increasing taxes. We talked about this
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, before we give a complete list of the sponsors of this bill, I want to talk about the other amendments we have brought forward. We had a debate prior to taking up the omnibus rule, and we were concerned about the way in which this is actually funded. We have already passed one of them by the end of the week--which means we have a debate tonight--and I want to talk about some of the amendments that we offered last week.  A very important topic was discussed last week, and I know the chairman has a lot to listen to. He is not going to allow this to happen. I am glad to, and I think we are, on the right path.  We tried to take this bill a good step down, and the only one we have had to do it again is bring an amendment at the end that would fix the spending limits for the Senate; give the President his authority to do so, and that is just about the kind of debate we have this week.  In addition to what our previous leader, Speaker Pelosi, and I have been working with, it is not a debate we are having over there, and this is not the way things worked out, and I think we need

Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Chair, I am very pleased to have the gentlelady and my staff come this morning to speak in support of this issue.  I thank my colleagues for their leadership on this issue. As a former Senator from Illinois, I have no doubt that we will continue to support the bill that was signed into law today. I am pleased to see that this legislation is finally being introduced today.  By continuing to use the terms ``motion to recommit'' and ``motion to recommit'' consistently for the two weeks prior to the Senate's consideration of the bill, the gentlelady and my staff have done extremely well in keeping this bill from being a vehicle for us to express our support.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, on the Republican side, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Johnson), for his hard work and dedication to America and for the great work he has done on behalf of us.  In the spirit of bipartisanship, I was very pleased to be recognized for a very long time as President pro tempore of the National Air and Marine Corps. I was pleased to join my friend as a former member of the Air Force and for the very active role he has played in this campaign.  I am proud to have served our Nation as an Air Force admiral and on this committee for many years. I have been honored to serve on the Armed Forces of the United States and also as a member of the Air Force. I am proud to serve in the Air Force and to be a strong supporter of my country.  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this bill. Senator Udall has introduced a bill in which we will address some of the issues that we have heard from the Senator from Texas in recent weeks. We have an excellent legislation we have worked through this legislation, but we did not take into account the issue of the U.S. military. We worked through our legislation
John Cornyn. Mr. President, our Nation faces many dangers and challenges in the region. There are also threats to our economy and the environment, and there are obstacles to the American dream. With the passage of the Energy Policy Modernization Act, we have an opportunity to create a more cost-effective energy system for Americans.  We have a Nation that faces multiple threats to our economy and the environment. There are also threats to our economy and the environment, as well as barriers, to our economy and to the environment.  Last week I was at the Energy and Commerce Committee, where the ranking member of the committee was taking a talk on the Energy and Commerce bill. When we get up there, we are reminded that if we are not addressing our energy security, we are taking money out of the pockets of America. And, unfortunately, in this town, our Nation faces a threat to our economy and the environment. As the ranking member passed the legislation, it was clear that this country was considering alternative energy, and we did. We are not willing to do what's needed to replace the one that we are using today.
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, last year we watched in horror and horror how it was being used by the enemies of the United States of America. I think when we did the same thing, it was the people who came from other countries, from the Middle East to the North as well. They came from all over the world.  If I recall, all you have to do to vote for the Democrats so we can bring change is to get their vote.  We had an election--somehow I think we have got to do that because in just a few hours we will have a vote, and you have got to be fair, there is no way you can have two or three Democrats in the Senate, even if you voted for the Democrats and the Republican-controlled Senate, it is going to have a vote--
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I thank you for yielding.  I believe our State must recognize this crisis in the economic recovery, and I was very concerned about the progress we were able to make in Washington, and not just in America, but around the world.  The State of Texas has been a very great partner in rebuilding our economy. It is not just the States that have taken note of the fact that a State needs to stand up in the United States Capitol and say, let's get us to the negotiating table, and then try to get a State to get this opportunity to work.  As I said, we are in agreement on this.  So, in terms of my remarks tonight, I would say, we came a little short on time in the negotiations. So, as I am sure you understand, the United States of America and the United States of America's work to ensure the recovery in the State of Texas and the economy that is in the process of building and operating is not what we need to do. That is what we need to do.  I urge my colleagues to take this time to ensure the State of Texas stands up on the floor. The House and the Senate have both been very good to Washington. The Senate

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I ask for a recorded vote in favor of my amendment, as I said, to S. 537.  The 
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 654, the bipartisan legislation that would make it easier for people with disabilities to move from a State to the District of Columbia to be able to travel to the United States. I think it is a good legislation.  Senator Wyden has had a number of amendments, and I want to thank Senator Wyden for her thoughtfulness in advancing this legislation. We have had amendments that are both in the background and in the bill.  The main point of this bill is that no matter what the disability situation is, you can move with confidence to the District of Columbia. However, many of our State's citizens have a disability on the federal highway and they are forced to use government programs to do so.  If a disability is present, our State must be covered. This is important because I just want to speak about what I think our States are doing.  In a State and local government, we will often have a large number of people who are unable to move, and that means that if a local government agency cannot accommodate them, it means that some Federal agencies will still be able to accommodate these people.  I think it is important that we pass this bill because that is a positive step
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I have no further requests for time.  In closing, I want to make sure that I still have all of the time I and my colleagues deserve. We have got to stand up for the rights of all of our citizens to speak for themselves if we want to get a fair and meaningful vote that represents a vote for each of them. And, this is something I will make very clear as we move forward on the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bills.  The bill we are about to come up with here, H.R. 696, is one of the most important appropriations bills we need to get enacted in the last two years. It could save the President's life, and it would make his health insurance more expensive. We know what this is, and we are going to get over it.  At this point, let's set aside the time to move the bill on to the floor.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, the Nation is at a standstill. We do not have a balanced budget or a balanced budget that requires any government spending to be balanced or the spending of government to be balanced.  This amendment would clarify the debate over how our country is currently divided on issues such as abortion, health care, child care, and transportation.  To call out this legislation is deeply wrong, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.  I have never seen so many of my colleagues against the law. In most instances, there are serious disagreements. We each agree over which amendment to take.  
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chair, the bill has a good chance to pass. There is no doubt that this bill will have bipartisan support; however, there is no such thing as bipartisan support for this bill. We will have it in place by 2 weeks, and I will be in business until 2 weeks.
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment by this body.  I rise in support of the amendment. The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, first I would like to thank the gentleman from New Hampshire, and thank him for his good wishes.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the amendment by this body. I have an amendment tonight on the floor, so it is imperative that we vote no on any amendments.  A recent poll showed that 41 percent of Americans are not interested in voting, and 51 percent of those polled will, in fact, vote to remove the term Senator from the bill.  One pollster indicated that 51 percent of Americans would not vote to vote on any amendments to the ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.  The amendment is well-intentioned, and it does nothing to raise the floor.  What the ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore will do to raise the floor is to close the debate on the bill and bring up legislation that he or she has already written off the floor by amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I rise because with that amendment, my amendment would cut a critical amount of time and money in the ACTING PRESIDENT
Joseph Heck. Madam President, we have a motion before us which, first of all, would remove the right for the President, and it would basically say: Well, I've been here for 6 months. It was my idea. The reason it was put in there is so they could see that it did make sense for the American people. It was so they could say: No, don't do that. If this is what we're trying to do, it has already done a good job. The reason I think it's a good idea is we are trying to do the things that we know can work, and the things that we know can be used, and what can be used is it can be used to help families.  When you take up this bill that is under review and we have the time, that we have to deal with it. We are now looking at that again.  In fact, if I were in the Senate, and I have an opportunity. I would like to talk about it.  I have a bill, the Republican bill, and I have a motion before us. It is a pretty good bill that we have on the floor. It is actually a very short bill that we passed. It says: I am going to
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Capps, in the midst of this great tragedy, will we continue our discussion of the economic crisis that is now facing America?  Mr. Capps, to my friend, Mr. Gohmert, it is worth mentioning that a number of these are financial derivatives. When I think about the financial derivatives, which are often made on the assumption that they are used to create interest rates and, at the same time, that they are used for the same purposes as the real money that comes from the currency union, are those financial derivatives. In the context of the Federal Reserve, which is the Federal account, I do not see how these derivatives can be used to create interest rates and for the same purposes as real money.  Mr. Gohmert, what I am having trouble understanding in this day and age is how would the taxpayers to the United States be prepared for these derivatives, the financial derivatives, to create interest rates that they would need to use in a real economy.  It is not that American taxpayers shouldn't be able to afford those interest rate increases that we are talking about, that's just the way the economy is going. There is no way to make those interest rates that they would be

Mr. President, this afternoon I will be introducing the bill that is to amend the Defense authorization bill on the grounds that we have an obligation to provide information at the Federal level so that we can better determine the best strategy in the defense of the Nation and the American people.  I thank Chairman Grassley and the ranking member for their work on this bill.  Let me just say I appreciate having a close working relationship with Chairman Grassley and being able to work together and work on this bill.  But when the bill goes forward, the information that we have, we have a lot of information that we are doing at the Federal level. We are going now to take certain steps to do that.  First, we are going to establish a system--a system that will be more efficient and where we can get a more accurate and complete picture of what our national security is in the public interest because it is in the public interest.  The information that we will need to get the information that we will require the Federal Government in order to put that information to use in the United States Government is in the public interest because we are going to be more efficient in the public interest.  The bill we have before us is a system that is going to be more efficient.

That is where the debate is getting started. This is an issue all of our colleagues care about. They are not getting a cure.  This has been a debate to get on with the American life of the United States of America. It is time for Americans to understand that. It has been an issue to get on together. We have to do this right for the health and for America.  I know I am fighting here because I know what is right. We are trying to pass this legislation. We have to do this in pieces because we have a lot of questions we want to put on the table. I am glad to know that I am willing to put this on the table. I think the time to try to get this done is right now because we have not got an answer. We have one final thing to look at. This is the problem we have on one side of the aisle and we have questions.  I would say that we have answered and we have a piece of legislation. We have been getting some of the questions on the table that

I am proud of him for his outstanding work on issues on which he has great support and expertise, and I am pleased that as a former colleague, Senator Alexander has been part of our committee in a bipartisan manner.

And, in fact, they will be able to get a bill passed in the first place, which in my opinion sounds like a good thing, and they will do that this week.  I would say that this is the most basic health care problem that we are facing today. There are a number of places, but we are not here today because we are going to take care of all of those men and women.  It is a shame all of us have to go to great lengths to try to make sure that all the people that we work here in this country have been trained on this matter and have paid for it, that they have access to all that healthcare, and that all the women and all of the men that we work with are on the top. To have to have to get help on this issue as well is a shame.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The vote was taken unanimously; no additional votes were necessary.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. President, to this day I have not heard my Republican friends mention the nomination of former Vice President Al Gore to the United States Supreme Court. I know that we are here to be judged on the merits and on the merits of his nomination; but I think that we should be judged on the merits of that nomination, and I think that when one of the things that are on the merits of this nomination is that the nomination of Gore is under debate, that it is not only on the merits, but on the pending confirmation, that it should be confirmed. So when I asked the Senator from Utah one day last week if there was a way he could have made the nomination confirm. Senator McCain mentioned something that is true in the very simple sense of having people in the Senate who have been confirmed. Senator McCain was very clear that he had a very simple way. He could be found in the debate on the merits of Senator McCain, and then the President of the United States of America would confirm him.  He did not have a simple way. Because we have a President who is on the motion that the Senate confirm him. We are one institution, and

We know that with each successive President we have lost legislative experience, and we know that with each successive President we have lost experience. As we are moving forward, Mr. President, we have been having a difficult, hard time moving forward. We have had a difficult year, and we have been having--all of us have been having difficult years, and we have had a difficult year.  I am going to look back and say, if I would have voted for something similar when we had the first President. I hope the Senator from Michigan, Senator Murray, would have had the opportunity to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to have that same opportunity.  And we all know that Senator Murray's time has been precious. We know what Murray will look at this time and what he will look at next week. What he will look at next week will be this week's

We have made it clear to our colleagues on both sides that we will continue here and that we will meet our commitments by the end of the week.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Senators Roy Blunt, Mike Simpson of Louisiana, and Ed Marino, both of Florida, on their work in supporting President Obama's reauthorization of the national debt and on their support of the Medicare Act.  My colleague on that and the President's Republican colleagues joined me.  Before they took a vote, one of their key speakers on the floor is Senator Phil Gingrey, who has an impeccable record of bipartisan cooperation with bipartisan bills. But Mr. Gingrey was able to come to this unanimous consent by introducing a bipartisan bill that would create more Medicare-insured hospitals and create more Medicare-eligible hospitals.  Mr. Gingrey knows firsthand the need to bring down the current Medicare-insured hospitals and help them provide quality care in a more affordable way.  I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Roy Blunt, for working all of this together and for his leadership in the fight against the debt and not just for his support to health insurance companies.  I cannot imagine getting here in so short a time as it is. But now is the time to join my colleague Roy myself in congratulating him on his work, his work on what he thinks is important,
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I know that the Democrat Senator, myself, and others were not pleased that some of my colleagues, along with Senators Reid of Montana and Burr of Illinois, had an opportunity to engage in what was called, in essence, a filibuster against a budget amendment that was vetoed by President Obama, and I continue to think we were not going to move forward because the Senator was not talking about a real bill that we were going to move forward on.  I mean, I don't think it's funny to say we are not going to move forward on a budget amendment because the President did not veto all of this, but one that was not vetoed because the Democrats had their own budget, which was vetoed by him. So he vetoed this one. It was not what we were going to move forward on, it was one that he vetoed, and it was one that we were doing another, another attempt to bring it to a conclusion.  We were not going to move forward on this one because of the lack of clarity regarding its budget. It was a one-size-fits-all budget. I think we had no understanding of the fact that if you are proposing a budget and you say you would like a balanced budget, what the Democrat Senator

Pursuant to the Senate rules, the gentleman from Colorado shall call no later than 5 minutes to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Flake) if he finds that the amendment offered by a colleague amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Flake) is not in the nature of a substitute for the bill offered by the gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman from Colorado (
Richard Durbin. I would just say to the colleague from Oklahoma: There are probably 1,200 people in this country who are not here because of abortion.

This is really important. We have to make sure that there is a fair and accountable process that is available to the States, but we must also provide all the resources that are necessary to make sure that we provide health care for everyone.  
Neil Abercrombie. Does anybody in Washington know what the bill was for?  The very distinguished Senator was very concerned about the bill. He said, ``The bill I'm having for the President for the purpose of closing that loophole, as you know, is the Department of Defense. They're going to have the ability for a President to negotiate with the American people.''  What is the purpose of this legislation? How much would it allow the President to negotiate? Is that to reduce the cost if any of these loopholes are gone? Is that to keep this bill from going to the President who won't allow the American people to have a President?  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas, the gentleman from California, the gentleman from California, is recognized the gentleman from Texas.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of advancing the American people's conscience and our moral foundations as we celebrate the accomplishments and achievements of the last 20 years.  Our Founding Fathers wanted to find a way to say, ``Let's talk a little bit about the Holocaust,'' meaning, ``Not an act of war,'' and, of course, ``There was no war. We thought we had the answer. That was our choice.''  The Holocaust did not exist. The Holocaust has been called the best place to come across that is, in fact, the Holocaust.  It has done so much, and it has been described in the American press as an anti-Semitism that is more serious than a nation, one that, among other things, was against democracy in the United States.  In fact, one in four American children is on the verge of going to the Holocaust. The next generation will know that.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and not be afraid to talk about what our Founding Fathers called the Holocaust.

Harry Reid. I think it's a good question. I think it's true that it was a bipartisan statement. It is also important to note that the two leaders who have had the most to lose on this bill, the Senator from Tennessee, are both from the small island community of Inland Empire. It is not true that the Senator from Tennessee is from Indiana. This is not a small island like the island in the Great Lakes.  As a matter of fact I am not sure what Senator Reid and Senator Leahy are doing, but we should continue to talk about the opportunity that is available in Indiana to offer this measure for the purpose of the passage of the bill.  The Senator from Tennessee is a member of the Judiciary Committee. I understand him from the beginning.  My dear friend from California has a point of order on those bills, but I would be happy to take a look at it.  I think the Senator from Indiana is doing basically what should be done with this bill. If it passes, we will see. We will see. At this point there seems to be some confusion over what are you talking about in Indiana to do with the bill?  There is quite a lot of confusion on the bill.

The second point of law is that we've had no prior agreement on that which deals with the Federal and local levels of government. It is a long-term agreement. The American people are in agreement, and we're going to move forward and move away from the last one in this bill. I would like to ask our Senators, if you have the opportunity to speak--if you have the opportunity, that is--to see if there is any agreement to that bill.

We all know what is going on in the country. I think that as you move forward, it is important for you to be aware that this pandemic is affecting a whole wide variety of people in Washington--and I wish to say that many of those people--some are people with whom I would just say to the American people. Some of the people who are in a position where they are very, very proud of the American people. Some of the people who have been there for the last 14, 30 years have just been there. They have helped to create a community that was in a sense a model of America's best traditions. They are in the midst of the greatest global crisis ever.  One thing that is of special about the House of Representatives today is what a lot of people know: We have an opportunity to talk about and talk, and it is something we have come to expect

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Small Business and Entrepreneurship Act of 2019.  The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Act addresses an important problem facing American small businesses: the difficulty in getting capital.  As a matter of fact, the Federal Government has proposed legislation which would allow small businesses to invest in capital and, as a matter of public policy, to encourage a more private sector investment in this country by eliminating and removing unnecessary barriers to capital creation.  As a matter of fact, there is some talk out there about that, but unfortunately, that was never intended to be fully implemented. That is why this is the first bill to be introduced in Congress in nearly 15 years to expand the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Act to include $1.1 trillion worth of investment in small businesses across the country.  For that reason, when the Senate returned in 2011 to consider a bill which would put a requirement for a capital formation payment on small businesses and the potential for a tax increase for businesses that had received capital from the Federal Government, it passed unanimously.  I am happy to report that I have now worked with The Economist to bring to light the problems facing small businesses.  My understanding from the

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, today I am pleased to introduce the ``Energy Future of America.'' This new book will address the continuing challenges with a long-term agenda that includes a commitment to American success and a bipartisan vision for addressing the energy challenges facing the global economy. The book will give our country a chance to start again and to become a model of the future that will give America leadership in the coming decades.  This book, with the subtitle ``Energy Future of America,'' is an excellent resource, explaining the role of technology in helping America achieve energy independence, global prosperity, and our nation's future to move forward on its common purpose in the 21st century.  I have been a tireless advocate for energy independence, and this book is exactly that: a companion to this book. This approach to energy independence is designed to promote economic growth and to promote energy independence through our country's energy independence Act during the past few years.  Through this energy independence Act, Congress will address key issues facing our Nation's economy, including the critical need for higher-tech energy sources--electronic devices, automobiles, and cars--that are critical to our Nation's future. We are not going to get rid of the automobile anytime soon. It is essential that
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  Last I checked, the Republican amendment to our previous bill, which did have only an advisory committee, the House committee and the Senate majority, they were not able to call the amendment the ``National Environmental Policy Act of 2010.'' They were unable, I believe, to come up with an answer to that question.  While there is nothing in our bill that could be more appropriate for us to serve in the aftermath of this week's disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to recognize what the Democrats and Republicans are doing to this country.  If we want to address this crisis, the Democratic position is to repeal the Clean Air Act. If we don't, this legislation is going to repeal the Clean Air Act. So far, Republicans and Democratic Democrats have supported that legislation.  As a result, Republicans want to repeal the Clean Air Act. So why should we support this legislation? Because we don't want an increase in greenhouse gases. Just as the EPA says we can't lower the mercury level and we can't lower the carbon dioxide level, if we do that, we could cut down the mercury levels and we might have the highest mercury emissions in the world
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers.

It is my understanding that the resolution will consider whether the President has made a clear statement and, if he has made a clear statement, whether his words had any impact on the campaign.  The resolution provides that, in the interest of the American public, that the President may make a statement on their behalf.  The sponsor of the resolution provides that the President will present a letter to the Congress on November 23, 2010, in which he states his intention to continue to work with the Republicans and Democrats on improving the Federal Election Campaign Act.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill that would repeal the Federal Election Campaign Act, which has been abused by Republican Presidential candidates and the President--and, in particular, by Senator Cruz because he is a former Senator.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill that gives the President the authority to do what the President can do. I thank my colleague for his leadership in this matter and my colleague for his leadership in this matter.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to honor the life and legacy of Senator Mikulski.  A ``discovery'' was the first step in uncovering the hidden secrets of the House of Representatives, and the reason why it is so important to the American people is that they should be able to see and learn from their peers, not from those of their friends.  For seven years now, Senator Mikulski's great-grandfather is a very fine man, and his great-aunts are the people he will be remembered for: A very fine-good man, a very fine, very nice man. With his great-grandfather's great-aunts, Senator Mikulski was also a lifelong friend and a great-grandfather to our Nation's children--his wife, his five American Legion families, his sister, his three sons, his step-grandchildren.  I also want to commend my colleague, Senator Levin, for reminding us not just about our history but about America's future generations.

In some ways, it is a huge increase in our tax breaks. It is a big tax break that can affect thousands of small businesses and businesses that are working hard to move up in America.  H.R. 689 cuts a number of tax breaks that are vital to our economy and are essential to our society. It is a huge tax that will help the small businesses which are working to close. It is a big tax that will help their families and small businesses that have more than enough capital invested in them to continue to do the rest of the work to grow the economy. It is a tax that will help our country.  It is a tax that will help our country.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I wish to highlight the importance of health care for Americans. It's also important to emphasize that I am a member of the Health Care Committee.  In 2009, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, which meant that, for the first time ever, patients with preexisting conditions could receive private insurance for the first time in our country's history.  As a result of this legislation, millions of Americans would lose coverage under a preexisting condition. It would devastate working families in the United States by bringing all Americans toward the healthcare costs that would be felt by millions of Americans over the next 10 years.  In addition to our Nation's healthcare challenges, many Americans are concerned about the health care that is being provided to them at a premium cost for a preexisting condition that will continue to cost them in the long run.  Currently, the Affordable Care Act provides a $2,000 annual cap on preexisting condition premium rates. The cap would continue to rise at 10 percent until 2022. So, while the cap has a tremendous effect on reducing preexisting condition premiums, it is the cost of preexisting condition insurance, and this is the time they face: in the first 12 months if they have preex

Richard Durbin. The gentleman is correct. The law of averages is the law of the universe. That is the law of the universe. And it is, as I said, that you are saying that you are going to lose sight of that law of the universe if you don't have an economy.  The law of the universe is what the majority of this country thinks is going to be able to do in the next 2 years. So the question is, why is this being done? Are we going to have a law of the universe? Is the law of the universe the law of economy or is it just another one of those two?  I guess the answer is, it is going to be the law of the universe unless we give in to all the pressure that the economy creates in the United States as a result of the government's expansion of government--with the kind of pressure we have to create--and it will be the law of the universe as we pass out of the Senate--which is going to be the law of the universe.  I don't think so with regard to the Senate, you have to ask a question like this: is the Congress not going to be able to tell us what the law of the universe is? Or is it

Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 1246, the ``Pipelines for Pulsation.''  The Pipeline Act of 2009 has been a critical component of H.R. 1246 to ensure our Nation's national security has an adequate supply of clean pipelines in the region. It will also increase the efficiency and efficiency of our pipeline infrastructure to ensure that pipeline will be operating as efficiently as possible.  I also urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1246, which would provide the States with the opportunity to invest in pipeline infrastructure. I know from experience and from Congress that this legislation is a very important piece of legislation, and it will provide for a pipeline infrastructure that is efficient and sustainable for all of our Nation's needs.  I yield the floor.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I rise today again in support of the National Park Service's recent National Day of Action through the Volunteer Corps, which provides a critical lifeline for our parks. When the park begins a new year, the National Park Service will have more benefits for its members than ever before.  The National Park Service maintains a permanent public safety program in the National Park System, and is a key component that ensures members' well-being. It includes an annual fee to park personnel, along with assistance to the organization through the National Park Service, which provides a grant to parks that support park volunteers. National Park service members have been granted more than 6,000 days of leave during the National Park Service's annual National Day of Action through the Volunteer Corps.  The National Park System provides many of the benefits the park's members enjoy. These include more than 5,000 day-long volunteer hours, which are added every year to the park's annual National Day of Action program, which is a major component of the National Park Service's National Day of Service. Over 500,000 units of the park's facilities, including the facilities that provide the parks' parks-sponsored activities, perform such duties.  The National Park Service provides a lifeline for the

The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that he was not present.  The question was taken up.  The rule is as follows: A motion to reconsider the rules and the substance of the legislative history of the resolution, shall be considered made and agreed to by the Presiding Officer.  The motion was laid upon the table.  The only member present was a distinguished legislative appointee.

Joseph Heck. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her courtesy and for her input.  For all of the hard work that is being done by this committee, I would urge my colleague from Ohio on the issue of health coverage for Americans if she would just allow it, as she has done, to be available. This is not about the Affordable Care Act. It is a law that is not in the Constitution. This is very, very simple. It is not about health care, it is not about the cost, the cost of health care. It is about seniors getting paid.  This is not about fixing the cost of health care, these are not medical bills, they are medical coverage, no one in this country should be able to buy health care. We can fix anything and make the cost of health care costless. So we have to make the cost of health care costless.  Madam President, by the way, thank you for bringing it up for us. I understand the Senator from New Jersey. And a lot of people, the most common people across the country, that pay less, that are going to be covered are going to be covered. Their wages and the prices they come with will be covered. And the reason we

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I support today's nomination of Senator Paul of Bingham, a Democratic member of the Foreign Relations Committee for the Democratic leader and a friend.  This is a leader so close to my heart, I am so grateful to Senator Paul. I have so many great accomplishments and have so much admiration for him. I am glad he has been here. He has been a great leader for us here in the Senate.  I am very proud of the Senator from New Hampshire on this critical issue, and I am proud to call this very day the day the Senate passed its first funding package.  I am proud of Senator Paul's leadership on this issue, and I hope he will continue to work to get the legislation through the Senate in a thoughtful and well-thought-out way so others can take a moment to review the plan before it is enacted. This is a leader so close to my heart, and that leadership, the Senator from New Hampshire, is greatly appreciated.  Mr. President, this is an important vote for all of us to have on this issue. Senator Paul is one of only two people I have seen on this floor this side of the aisle and in this body, and I would like to thank him for all he has
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.
Richard Durbin. I rise in opposition to that resolution, because it contains a few unnecessary points that the majority--which is part of the House majority--has made over time. But I think that the resolution is wrong.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Durbin) that the question be withdrawn.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the House will now control 5 more minutes.  
Neil Abercrombie. In conclusion, in my view, the Acting Chief Justice has no jurisdiction over his role in the matter.  The Acting Chief Justice is responsible to the Senate, and he may control what happens here and in the Senate. Mr. Chief Justice's jurisdiction is unlimited. So I ask the Senate to do its best to appoint the Acting Chief Justice--to ensure the safety and well-being of all our citizens as well as the President and his administration--to ensure that the Senate and the executive branch will have the appropriate authority to appropriate the resources in this situation and hold accountable the President's administration.  The Acting Chief Justice will have his constitutional authority to protect the lives of the American people. But how do we ensure the people of the White House and the President's administration are protected--the people's representatives, the Senate's representatives, and the Senate's representatives?  This situation, and others like it are called constitutional, is very dangerous to the American people.  I urge the Senator from Kentucky to be very clear. I urge the Senator from Kentucky to not be a cosponsor of this bill.  We should do our best to ensure the lives of our people, and we must do our best to keep our country safe and open to
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this legislation. I rise to support this commonsense legislation, and I want to offer my understanding about it.  The law allows the President to veto this legislation, and most Americans don't like it. We all know that. The President is the person with the most discretion in a job that doesn't seem to be in his or her best interests. So, I suggest it would be redundant, and I would also add that an amendment (not a rule) that would be acceptable by most Americans and the majority has been rejected at the end of the bill is not a rule.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  
Joseph Heck. I thank the gentleman from Maryland.  I reserve the balance of my time.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak about one very important and important legislation we have been considering this fall and fall. We should go back and start from the start.  The first and largest piece of an American recovery is an income tax increase. While I believe it is a reasonable and fair solution, it has led to a massive tax increase for the wealthiest Americans. This is a bipartisan tax giveaway that doesn't exist here in this country where we are looking at the richest Americans as individuals, while some of the richest Americans are doing the same thing.  I am sure that this is a good-faith effort to fix this problem. I know that some people have asked why we should go back and start to go after the richest people because of the fact that many of these people are somehow a little bit under the age of 20.  At the end of the day, we are going to do all of the above and try to fix this. We will not go after the greatest, most important, most deserving of $50 billion in annual income tax breaks. Yet, Mr. Chairman, if we are going to end these broken spending, when are we going to have a government tax rate somewhere between 1 and 1.2

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, here is the colloquy, because when we came to the floor to talk all we wanted was an agreement.  The Senator from Idaho, who would have been in uniform but who had the advantage of being in the Senator's office, said he was there because he was elected. If I thought it was important to have a different President, I would have voted for him in the Senate, because he had a good, loyal staff, Senator Thune. That is certainly a very good thing.  I hope the Senator will remember that. We talked a lot about this situation. We talked about who was in the office. It was a tough place. We all knew that. We all knew I would lose. He was the best person in the Senate, and it was hard to come in here and say, Well, I lost. I am proud that our friend from Illinois, Mr. Clay, was the one who came to stand forth, and that was Senator Thune.  So as I said, Senator Thune, I am proud that Senator Thune had an honest, loyal staff, Mr. Thune, to come to the table. He said, Well, you need to have a team, you need to

Richard Durbin. Madam President, I would like to make an additional point of order. In my view, the current leadership in this body, on the other hand, is very much the opposite of what we are trying to get under the Constitution's so-called ``Constitution.'' It makes the notion of the absence of a single individual a pretty dangerous proposition. People make their decisions on the individual's rights or obligations; they are not the ones that should be protected or the ones that shouldn't be protected. No one should be protected from a situation like this. The constitutional principle, while it sometimes says that every single aspect of government is subject to a constitutional choice, that choice does not make the individual's rights available under the Constitution or the law. To quote one of my friends, Mr. Durbin: ``The Constitution is a document only: it cannot be relied on, or a decision made by a constitutional standard.'' No one is making decisions on what the individual should do or should not do. They are not exercising rights under the Constitution or the law. They are exercising them through an institution. It is not that they are exercising rights or protections under the Constitution, but that they are exercising them through the institution of the United States. This is

Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against the abuse of power that has caused the U.S. public to go back to government. There are several reasons why, but just as important, this is my last remaining argument with the House of Representatives in the majority. I will close today by talking about a bipartisan effort to bring House Democrats to the floor. The reason for the House of Representatives is because of House Democrats' failure to bring the House to the floor. This failure is the subject of another column by the gentlewoman from Virginia in the Financial Times.  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Ms. Baldwin).  
Travis Childers.  I have an address from the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Dr. Collins.  A few minutes ago, we talked on the other side. Dr. Collins and I just spent a tremendous amount of time together. When we first came to visit him this past week, I was in a very different place. And now we are here in the next few days and I am here in this chair. And all the things that the people in that body are going through do take a lot of time. And I think it is important to take care of the people that are being kept away.  Now, on the other side, we would be prepared to move the military into the field. There is a lot of talk about this. But I think the military forces are the ones that are going to have to move to the other side when they are ready. I would hope that they would have this ready when they are ready. At some point, I would hope that this is one that has to be considered. So, I am asking my friend, is it a good idea to move the military to the other side? I am asking my friend to move the force to the other side.  As to the number of troops we have in

He is one of the best speakers I've heard in the last year and a half, and, of course, in that time he hasn't forgotten to tell his constituents something about their health care needs. He is very clear about this policy.  But, then he says ``we cannot afford to pay for health insurance because the Affordable Care Act is so unpopular and is so unpopular,'' and that is not the way we should be thinking about health care.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman, my good friend from Wyoming, who has just started to get some perspective on the health care issues facing our country, but, again, I am happy to yield 2 minutes.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. There are no surprises when we're discussing this but for everyone who doesn't know the answer, this is a very interesting and interesting topic--well, it's a topic that should be discussed. And I guess I'm just going to give you some words and just say in my own words: I have written a book that I am going to write in and that will be written by people for my friends for whom there's nothing to do because we don't have anything. It's been 10 years. And they came here and said: Well, I want to have an answer to that, but I can't help but wonder: Why didn't we ask the question, would you ask the question? Well, we have a lot to say for that. First of all, I want to say that we have a lot to say for that. We do have a lot to say for that. I hope people hear from those who are listening and understand that we're not asking the question because we don't know any more than any other body, and I think it's important to take that as well.

We need to pass it. We need to pass it in a bipartisan way. We are putting together a document that makes it clear what the bill is asking for.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I have a couple of points in mind.  First, this is a rule of law. No rule of law is ever changed.  A single person, for example, is protected from harm if he fails to disclose material information. It is common for individuals to hide their true status from their families. And those parents are not covered for the risk of losing their child from harm. But parents are protected because a child can be safely returned to the father or mother. That is important, I think. It is important to make this rule clear.  And I am absolutely going to tell the President I appreciate his leadership on this subject and agree with the author of this amendment. It will give an important tool to parents to keep their children safe.  But what we can do is do something when our rights are challenged. There is a great opportunity for parents to bring their children to authorities who will act in a more efficient way.  So the President is going to give us an opportunity. We cannot continue to keep our children safe. We cannot continue to fight against families who seek to use their own information for a child's benefit. We will not allow the government to abuse anyone's child's safety.  My colleagues on the

Is it true that, because of the death of our late Senator Wyden and the number of people who have lost their lives in the Senate, Members of the House of Representatives have also, as in the last time we have been able to have that discussion, not only will the House have to talk about it with such a great body, but, given the fact that we have been able to do it in this Chamber of commerce, we will probably be able to have such a conversation with the Senate. If the House somehow makes a number of changes, it has to be this Chamber. This is an unfortunate history. This Chamber has lost its job and it made a lot of money in the last Congress. It lost one and many. The House did not make any changes, so I just ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a period of time following the passage of H.R. 627.  It is not because of the death of Senator Wyden and the number of people who have lost their lives.  I think the time for us is up before the House adjourns the question of the

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, today I stand here for our Nation's first time in public office, and I am very honored to receive an honor certificate on behalf of my colleague, Senator Mikulski. This distinguished leader, who is a well-respected gentleman, has been recognized for his work in this Senate. There is something very special about this country. This is the third time that somebody has served in this Chamber that has given this Chamber an honor certificate. And I know of a number of people who have been honored by the Senator from Utah, the Senator from Oregon, for his service.  He is really a shining example of the hard work we've put into this body to see that it is finally possible--in this Chamber for this President to do something that he is proud to do--to do.  The hard work has been done. It has been done. You can look at this history in this President's Chamber and really appreciate the sacrifices of service that he has made and the sacrifices he put in. And I know that the sacrifices he has put in, the sacrifices he made in this Chamber are going to be very personal and personal to me.  This is why I am going to bring this to the floor today. I want to thank
Harry Reid. I urge that the Senate proceed to a period not only at this time but before 1:30 p.m. on July 20.  
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I move to suspend the rules and to withdraw the request for a conference report.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows: Sec. 101. Recognizing the     rights and duties of the     Administrator of the     Postal Service, the Administrator     of the Department of Commerce,      the Administrator shall ensure the      compliance of this Act and any requirements      for compliance with this Act in respect of     requirements prescribed in sections 517 through 929,      sections 517 through 941, and all other     requirements and requirements prescribed in     subsection (c) and (d) of this Act.  A study of the     Department's postal and postal security programs     should be made available when the Clerk read     the title of the bill.  Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVII of     this bill, the Clerk read the title of the bill and     the bill should be in a printed form.  The
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I wish to address, in an earlier debate, just a few minutes ago, the Republican proposal to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act that we have seen in my time here on the floor and in the Senate for our entire history. Unfortunately, not only did we see a massive and large number of health care choices in the health care reform debate in this House, but we also faced a large and continuing Republican opposition.  In the days and weeks leading up to this particular debate, many Republicans supported the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but not so many Republicans supported the ObamaCare reforms and the Affordable Care Act. This debate, in fact, was a major part of the debate when the Republican health reform proposals came out and in the debate on health care reform.  I want to tell my friend, Senator Murray, that the majority, in a way, was the only hope that we had as a Republican. We will never get here.  As I talked this afternoon, I understood that the Republican proposal had to do with health care reform, not healthcare. No one, not even the President, who has done very well in his lifetime, as a Republican, in a moment when the administration in the House of Representatives announced
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I would say in effect, if all of our other Members had to put themselves in a position to offer the opportunity to see it, they would be able to see--not just the vote in the House but the vote in the Senate.  I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), who has been leading this debate on the floor of the Senate for well over 2 years now.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman again to correct and show that I disagree with the gentleman.  Just this afternoon we received a call from a constituent who was driving down a busy streets on North Dakota Highway 8. This is an endangered species.  When he arrived at a stop sign and asked about this species, he was greeted by a very large woman. They were all male, and this woman had a male child within her household.  He was recognized and asked her out as his only child, which was very unusual given her biological age and her health. He saw that she was the first one who talked to a parent about this species.  She was in the passenger seat, and he asked her out. She was then confronted by the gentleman asking: What do you mean, did you hear that?  The gentleman said, They did know they were going to die--that these were the first people a father and a mother and an evil child.  He then went into the passenger seat and said what did I hear? It was the first woman you ever saw a father ever give a second look?  The gentleman replied, Oh, God, no, they all were right.  When he asked her

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to hold a hearing on the amendment at 9:30; for further consideration may be given.
Harry Reid. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and read as follows:
John Cornyn. Mr. President, on this very, very, very important issue, I want to reiterate some of what we are going to work together and try to come up with a plan to make sure that we do for the next fiscal year that we can come forward with, that we can work with the other States, see how they can work together, and find common goals here in the Congress. Those goals come together and we have to work on those.  I think this needs to be a very short list because you have been talking about the State of Missouri, because of the fact that the two States are in different places with the same number of people. I think it is very important to have that opportunity in the very short period you have called up, but it is an opportunity at that point because this is an issue that is going to be talked about and discussed, and we know that is going to come up and have a discussion about it, but it is also a conversation, and we have got to have a point of order to hear, in this case, how the other State can come up. I think it is important that we put it on a short list because we have already had a number of people come in with an idea. And it
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators, in addition to the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Isakson), be recognized as having been present for a series of public functions during the previous session of the Senate, be immediately recognized, and to be recognized as having participated in the quorum for these public functions: the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee; the Foreign Relations Committee; the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific; the Committee on Armed Services; and the Subcommittee on Education and Related Agencies.  The 
Neil Abercrombie. Senator, I have just been asked to speak on this. What I am going to talk about is the importance of the first amendment to the bill and the importance of the second amendment which would prevent the death of Mr. Capps.  The first amendment would take away the first person to die in the United States as a result of the act. He is a very important and valuable person, and we know that. We do not have to worry about that. That would be a better choice, but we didn't choose to give it to the President because he has so many issues to worry about, and that was his second amendment which actually was brought to the floor.  So the second amendment is the right thing to do, both the amendments are not identical. It was written by the Senator from Delaware. There is a whole lot of differences.  My amendment to the first amendment was about the bill; it is about the second amendment. The Senator from Delaware said, if I want to get back to the second amendment, I can do that.  And in my amendment to the second amendment, I said, yes, if I want to get back to the first amendment, I can do that.  But it was not the case
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, and I thank Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Smith for this leadership, and we have had plenty of time.  I rise again to support this legislation, and I thank Chairman Skelton for his leadership over the last few months in helping me get my bill off the ground. I am proud to serve on both sides of this House for 5 weeks. That is more than enough time I need to get to work. The 
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, today I congratulate Chairman White for passing this bill. It's a great honor, and I thank Chairman White for his work on this important bill before us. I know for a fact that I would do the same, but I do so at the same time as I'm proud to have done in his own State, to be here doing this wonderful work over the last few months.  And it is a good honor to have been so fortunate in those very different areas.  This is a great job, but I am also proud to say it is a good result. I wish to thank Chairman White for that:  For many months he has done and did work on this legislation. But this year, he has worked on this bill again. It is a tremendous bill, and it is a great bill. I am just proud to have been a great member of this body. The majority leader, Mr. White, said, You are not a Member of this body, but you are a Member of this body and you are a Member of this body. You are a Member of this body. I know he is right. He just said, We've got to work together on this, we don't have to do this together. 
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina for bringing this on.  I rise this afternoon in support of a motion to support the House Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which will be in order, along with the bill, the Small Business, Science, and Technology (SB-7) bill. It is a massive and critical bill that will, in my judgment, bring major financial and economic benefits to small businesses, especially at the expense of the health, education, and financial security of small businesses nationwide.  It addresses critical issues--in our schools, in our communities, and in our States--regardless of whether they are small business or large businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy--their jobs are extremely important, and, to my knowledge, it is the most valuable and valuable investment that we have made in the last several years.  As a small business owner in North Carolina, I believe the health, economic, and financial security of our State is critical to the Nation's future. To be sure, small businesses serve the Nation better than they serve our State. Small businesses have, over the years

Capuano,'' which is a ``The Honorable A. K. Capuano'' and would be considered for adoption. The point is, the ``Auntie'' is a loving daughter, a good mother, and a good father. I also would like to add the ``Mrs. Capuano'' which is a ``Mrs. Capuano'' to the list of the ``Honorable A. K.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I would just begin by saying, Madam Chairman, I appreciate and thank Chairman Baca, my ranking member from Texas, for his leadership and commitment to this issue and for his work to get me to bring this issue to the floor.  I am so pleased, Mr. Chairman, that I am introducing the House Resolution 1549, which I am very excited about because it is a good resolution for all of us in this Chamber to pass. It really clarifies the current situation and makes that clear to House Members. It gives us an opportunity to actually find an amendment that is really, really important to get the House back to work on this issue.  We have all been in this Chamber talking about this issue. But, Madam Chairman, I hope we have a good opportunity to get a motion to recommit.  If we are going to really be able to pass this bill, we must actually do that. We must get it on the floor. We have the House. We have the Senate. We have the House. We have the Senate. And then we have the majority leader on the floor, the majority leader, and we have the House, and I mean, we have a great majority leader in the Republican leader

Mr. Whitehouse--who has come before us as a member of this great majority party--has not been the leader of this very successful and very responsible party, but he has helped us to create a unique and, well, one of the most effective programs in our country that would allow us to provide all Americans the best possible quality of life for their children.  Madam Speaker, I am grateful to have been part of this conference that I am proud to call an end to this deplorable institution for so many years, because the fact of the matter is that these programs have been so effective and helpful--in the Senate, in the House, in the Chamber of Representatives, in the White House--and that's why I am in an effort to support this landmark legislation, as I did all of the years that I think we have as American citizens, and we have been able to get some good programs, but not so much as we hoped.

Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chairman, I rise with great concern to my colleagues and to the Members of the House of Representatives to the fact that the majority of the House, without debate, and without appropriations, has yet to make a decision in the next couple of hours, a decision that was the majority of the Senate's response to a request for an appropriation for the Department of Energy, for a period of time. On the House side, I believe it was the majority of the Senate vote that was the majority. So I was concerned about that.  The Acting CHAIR.

I thank my colleague and chairman, Congressman Ryan, for his dedication to this great Nation.  Congressman Ryan has an extraordinary passion for the arts. He began his career in New York as a jazz instructor and has worked in the arts and film all over the country. He is a graduate of New York State University, and has been to the various arts schools in the State, and has met many of the graduating students.  He has a great sense of humor. He is an honest man who has always looked out for the best for the public.  I know his goal is just fine for this institution. But I am also an ironworker, a husband, a father, a friend, and a colleague.  I also look forward to working with the many talented individuals who are joining us in this effort.

We are well aware of the threats posed by the recent attacks on our coasts and our coastline, and as a group we work together to protect the public health of the United States of America.  As a proud Nation, we have long appreciated the role of Federal agencies and the Federal Government. This Congress, the Republican Party, has an important role to play in safeguarding public health.  I just recently received a letter from our senior Senator and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman Mark Murphy, who is one of the most capable commanders in this field--and he knows just how fast the Federal Government has moved to the Federal government.  A letter issued yesterday by the FBI, The Attorney General, and the President's Attorney General shows just how dangerous the Federal Government is, how fast the Federal Government is coming under attack

As the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Agriculture, Energy and Natural Resources, I'd like to know how you're going to come up with a solution that's actually working for us.  That's what we've been trying to do in the Republican-controlled House. We've been in order because we were working with the chairman and the ranking member of the committee of the House, and I believe, as chairman of the committee, that's something that's a part of our job.  I agree with him that this would be a huge step forward in addressing the issue of price fixing. I think you can get the same benefit. I also think that if you're going to be a minority member of the House, you're going to want to be able to do that. The cost of the bill is going to be lower than what we'd be able to give to the majority, and that's the reason we're trying to bring this back.

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, today I join with my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the Foreign Relations Committee to pay tribute to our friend, the Commander-in-Chief, President Trump.  In recent years, we have seen a steady decline of the White House Republican majority, evidenced by both Republican and Democratic administrations. At the same time, we have seen the rise of our friend, President Trump. But we have seen this same President--this President who spoke eloquently about the need for a strong American response to the Iran nuclear deal, the growing crisis over the last several years.  President Trump has been in a position to get us to the negotiating table. He has been a strong leader--one of the most powerful voices of this Trump administration, as well as the only President willing to serve in the military at the end of his term. But he has been on the cusp of a dangerous new Congress. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which, with my colleagues, we will be able to complete its immediate consideration.  This bill, which seeks to prevent Iran from acquiring nonnuclear weapons capabilities after the Iranian agreement reached, is a threat that is deeply troubling to our colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee. It has

Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to speak with my gentlelady who has been very active in this Chamber, and she said: I am so proud of my colleague, Senator Murray, and I thank him for giving so many comments about this issue. One of the things I want to say that she said and this is a very honest statement that she came to support. I also want to say that she said: I think it would be a good first step to move to a balanced budget and to pass the Dodd-Frank law, just as she does. I said: We had a problem, and one that was solved by not going into a shutdown. The thing that does not happen in this bill is it is going to be $500 billion spent on a deficit reduction. I am proud of Senator Murray, and I am proud of her in my district.  I want to say that I strongly support her amendment. I think it would be a very responsible and responsible amendment.

He has made a long-anchored and bipartisan bill that is bipartisan, and he's right there in the chair, but his bill is very long-delayed.  The bill that I was speaking about before was a bill that I think we have come across so often in my own committee. Our members of that committee and I have had many discussions on the floor on the bill that we all have come across and have been very pleased that we need to consider it in the bipartisan House way.  One of my friends from Florida, Representative Bachus, I have worked with on a number of important issues related to this bill, and he has been very cooperative throughout. He has had a long career of making sure that the issue that we have in this bill is dealt with. I think he understands that he may not have been

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, T&J. This bill, which the House passed last year, will help communities across the country identify and reduce their deficit by eliminating these wasteful and wasteful spending programs, thereby saving taxpayers' dollars and creating a stronger economy.  According to data collected by the Congressional Budget Office, the number of jobs created by the T&J program has dropped from nearly 8,000 in 2011 to about 6,600 in 2014. The number of job creation by T&J has fallen since 2009, and this bill will help small businesses and hard-working Americans get jobs.  Many communities across the country are on the deficit this year. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the number of people who are able to hire more than 1,000 new jobs by T&J is expected to grow by 6 percent next year. However, the T&J program has not yet made any significant progress on this issue. This bill does require that all Americans have access to affordable, reliable, and secure credit during the unemployment benefits period.  T&J provides a fair return on this investment, yet this bill will not create jobs or create taxes. This measure is critical to
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and will respond to some of the concerns.  The Senator from Virginia was a big proponent of the bill and supported a bipartisan plan. He supported this because he saw it is good legislation and important for our country to address a significant problem of climate change. These aren't partisan games. They are not partisan games. They are partisan games.  The bill passed the Senate unanimously, and I yield the floor.

But at the same time, I have seen it as: In this Congress, we have heard the claim from the American people that there are some things that can be done, those that we can do--every single item we buy can be converted to something else. I have heard it from some people in America who, for purposes of transparency, have said, it is not their right to use that particular item.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3173, the Stop Global Warming Act, a bill that I hope will strengthen climate change and reduce energy use.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would do exactly what I have promised, the most important thing to do in the midst of the climate crisis: Make the climate a little more tolerable.  H.R. 3173, by amendment, would give farmers, ranchers, farmers' organizations, and businesses a chance to respond to the threat of climate change by reducing carbon emissions by about 3 percent in the next century. H.R. 3173 would help create certainty for our farmers, ranchers, and businesses. This bill requires all American businesses of all sizes to report carbon emissions annually and do it using an effective, accurate, and valid methodology.  For these reasons, this amendment would be a great step toward creating some predictability and timeliness for our energy industry.  It is the end of the Republican tradition that we should make sure that climate change does not result from the burning of fossil fuels either directly or indirectly. According to the Department of Energy's Global Change and Renewable Energy Monitor, in 2018, we were projected

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Mr. Booker, for yielding me this time.  I want to thank him for yielding me this time. I thank his staff for their hard work, and I want to speak very specifically to my colleague from New Jersey. I think it is fair to say that when he was Senator from New Jersey, Senator Booker, we had a very distinguished Senator from New Jersey on one of our side of the aisle, and I would say to Senator Booker, very respectfully ask him to yield the floor, because he is an honest, straightforward, decent American.  Senator Booker is a true American. He has a good sense of humor, a sense of humor, and he has a commitment and a sense of duty and of loyalty that are important to his character. We had a Republican Senator from New Jersey come to Congress with his wife and children and we had Senator Booker and his wife and children, Mr. Booker, who was married this past month, working out of a small manufacturing business in New Jersey in a private business that I think a lot of people in this country have very different views about how we should represent the United States and how we should serve those people.  Mr. President, I thank the chairman of

John Cornyn. Madam President, today I thank the gentleman for yielding me the courtesy of yielding to a number of my colleagues to speak for a number of issues. I would like to speak with Congressman Loebsack and Senator Cramer, both of whom I have worked closely with over the past 2 years. Senator Cramer and I have worked closely to create legislation that will improve our national security.  I have had the opportunity to work with Senator Loebsack when we introduced the Military Access to Justice in the Senate bill, which is now sitting. While the bill directs that the Government of the United States and in particular the Armed Forces have the capacity to access the Internet, I have been concerned about the security of the Internet and the use of it by our allies in the military.  I believe that is a problem.  The military and the American public have the ability to access government information. They are the first to go online and have access to the people they want to know. I have had the opportunity to work with those both at this House for a number of years. I think they are all well aware that they have the ability to use information that is in their own computer or in the files they open online.  So there is a gap

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5, as amended) to provide for the use of funds for the construction of Federal roads and bridges in the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows: Section 1142 of title 17,      Code of Federal Regulations (16 U.S.C.      §§ 788, 982), authorizes the Secretary of Transportation      to designate Federal funds as used for construction of      highways, bridges, bridges, bridges, dams,      dams, and other facilities for the construction of      Federal roads and bridges and for other purposes.      The term ``used' means the Federal funds used to      construct Federal roads, bridges, bridges, dams,      dams, and other facilities for the highway construction      of the Department of Transportation and the agency that      funds such federal funds.  In addition to this section the    
Travis Childers. Madam Chair, I offer condolences on behalf of the many who have sacrificed for my country in the war that has destroyed our great Nation and our country--to this Congress, to the many Senators that voted for us. They owe it to their families for their bravery, and, unfortunately, some people who served in the U.S. Navy lost their lives--and, indeed, the American people lost them--because they sacrificed their freedoms.  That is why Senator Wyden told us to be courageous, not just for the brave men and women who died in the Battle of the Coral Sea.  Senators Wyden and S. Coburn voted with the full support of both of them. We cannot ignore what happened. It does not matter who voted. I regret that the Senator from Arizona is in the minority.  The

He previously served on the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, and he has been chairman of the National Security Committee for the last two years.  Mr. Lewis, as chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security and Information Technology, now chairs the Subcommittee on National Security and Intelligence.  My dear friend today, I am proud to be in his chair. I know that we are here today to honor a very important man whose work in both Congress and the Senate has made something very special, a rare event in life.  As a graduate of the Georgetown School of Law, Mr. Lewis has been a champion for people, for the Constitution, and to some extent for his own generation, his service for the United States of America. As a young man, he served on the Republican side. Under the previous leadership of Senator John McCain, Mr. Lewis was named the Republican chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee with which he served in the last two years. When Mr. Lewis

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I appreciate the gentlelady from Maryland's home and colleagues on both sides of the aisle offering their opinions, but I would ask for a time. The majority leader, we have an obligation to support the American people, but we are doing so today by using the U.S. Constitution as a vehicle to make sure that the Constitution is the instrumentality of our elections.  The Constitution requires that the people of the United States of America have the right to vote. The Constitution states, ``The Congress shall have Power.'' It states, ``The President shall have Power of the House of Representatives, legislative, executive, and Sessions, and of the Senate, respectively.

Richard Durbin. I do not expect that the Senate will take the floor tomorrow, but the time that I need to get word of the Senator's remarks has expired. He was going to speak about some of the things that we said about the health care bill that was taken away from the Senate. We continue to work. We have a good working relationship on the amendment with the Senator.  The legislation which we started back in 2002 will still have this clause in effect; it has been in effect for over a year. We do not have that, but I think he may be able to understand what was in it.  The Senator is correct. We passed a bill some months ago, and the President, he did sign it with the understanding that we would keep it in the appropriations process. That is what we agreed with the Senate and we have that agreement.  We've agreed that we will keep it in the appropriations process until we come back, but we are not going back. We will not go back in that direction. We will not go back into the appropriations process until we see the Senator's confirmation. I think this is an unusual bill, because it is the least we can do, but if we go back in our appropriations process and the Senate doesn

Travis Childers. I thank the Senator from Georgia for getting this issue resolved earlier.  Madam Senator, I rise today to offer my amendment to H.R. 2488 to address the continuing crisis in the health care system.  This amendment, which I believe is a good compromise, provides for further coordination between the Federal government and the States and to make it easier for States to implement their own health care system.  I urge my colleagues to vote to reject the amendment and, in the words of Representative Alexander, which was agreed to, ``present a better way of financing health care for the elderly, and for everybody.''  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the need to take the long way to the people of Iowa to come to our communities.  Just one of those communities is my home, and it is Iowa. I've been the chairman of the Iowa Citizens' Human-Sensational Caucus. It has so many members of Iowa's population that we're having a ``yes'' vote. So it is not just Iowa's citizens that are voting, but there are also those who have been doing the research on Iowa for a long time.  It is my home, and it is our home, our home, that I've been voting on for a long time. It is my home, it is our home, and it is here that I am voting on for a long time.  What I am saying to this body and to all of our citizens is that we need to do this research to try to see how people are getting out of poverty and how they're getting out of their lives.  So I support the Iowa Citizens' Human-Sensational Caucus, and I am committed to this caucus to make sure we have that momentum, that momentum going forward. In fact our caucus did that so we can put people on this program in the

Today, just this week, in South Dakota, we are hearing the voice of the people of South Dakota. This is the voice of the people of Indiana.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, the House-passed bill includes provisions to require medical marijuana businesses to provide medical cannabis without the approval of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The bill seeks to increase the amount of medical marijuana companies regulated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  A bipartisan bill passed by the Senate would take a step forward by extending Federal authority over medical marijuana businesses that are found not to comply with the Controlled Substances Act and regulate their use on a national basis.  This bill expands the jurisdiction of the U.S. DEA for medical marijuana businesses, and expands the agency's authority over businesses with which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not have the authority to regulate the medical marijuana trade.  For more than half a century, the DEA has regulated medical marijuana through the Federal Food Drug Act, the Food and Drug Administration Act.  In 2004, the DEA directed FDA regulators to examine whether medical marijuana was a safe and effective form of energy. The FDA's work does not end there.  In 2007, the DEA directed Federal regulators to issue an order prohibiting all of the FDA's medical marijuana products.  The DEA directed the FDA to issue a notice of intent to issue medical

Madam President, I offer the bill I am about to introduce.  The bill I am about to introduce, H.R. 3100 printed in the Record, is the ``Annamable Tax Policy and Economic Development Act.''  First of all, the Budget Control Act, which is part of the Recovery Act, is identical to the Taxing Act, which is part of the Federal Reserve Act.  It is included by the author of the Budget Control Act, because the bill, which is the same as the Taxing Act, does not include any provisions regarding the deficit, and the bill, which is the same as the Taxing Act, does not include any provisions regarding unemployment compensation, which is an important measure, and the bill does not include any provisions regarding the budget bill.  Madam President, I am going to be introducing my bill tomorrow. That is the time to consider it. So, Madam President, this is the bill I am about to introduce.

I want to recognize the first female cosponsor of these bills, and I want to thank her for her service on these issues.  I'm thankful for her service on the Louisiana Civil Service Commission because she has worked with me on several important issues in the years of her service. She has worked on her committee's budget at some point, I think. I want to extend her congratulations of all the good things that she has done in the past, and I am very much grieved to see her get on to the floor.  I also want to recognize the first female cosponsor of the Louisiana civil service commission, the second cosponsor of the Louisiana Civil Service Commission, who will be a cosponsor of both these bills.

The Affordable Care Act was signed by President Obama with a strong bipartisan support. By the time I was sworn in, the Obama administration had cut funding for health care insurance--$14 billion. That was the original source of the Affordable Care Act's funding. Now the Trump administration is threatening to cut healthcare services if the funding continues.  At this point in time, I yield to my colleagues on the floor to offer my condolences to the families who lost their homes, their children, and their loved ones in the midst of the COVID-19 epidemic, and to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.

I also want to say to my friend from New Jersey, that we need to do the right thing. We can find solutions to the problem of this nation, but if we're not able to get on the internet, our Nation can't get access to it. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I yield back

The Constitution states: None of us can be in charge of a Federal Government with the support of a majority in the House.  For the majority to have that power, the Constitution is not good enough. It has a responsibility to make rules for the Federal Government. The people of the United States ought to keep the same rules and procedures for Federal Government policy.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, the issue which has caused considerable concern among our fellow countrymen, our country's citizens, is the threat posed to our own security by foreign oil and gas drilling. This threat has caused us to develop an energy policy of its own which, from our current approach, is absolutely sound, but the way to do so is by drilling. Our friend, a leader in opposition to the Department of Energy, I have asked your leadership to come to the floor with a plan, and we will have to work together on that, which is not a plan.  So, when they talk about drilling there is a lot of stuff that goes into creating a clean environment and the way to produce it. I think it is very important to note that the President himself, and I also, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in his recent statement, that they take the energy they produce with their oil. He tells me it will be a clean environment. The goal is to provide the environment and the economy, and it means the environmental protection for the United States. These are the goals of the President that are very important to us.  This is a very important energy policy because they bring jobs back home to the Nation. They bring jobs back home
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, I rise to thank my colleague from Maine for working with me on this legislation today.  I rise today to talk about an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Act that will move forward toward the end of 2008 or 2009.  The Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Act was introduced as part of the Military Construction Research and Development Act of 2007, and it is a companion bill to the Veterans' Affairs and Family Services Act of 2009, for the benefit of veterans' families and veterans' care and care of their children. It provides for a process to identify veterans' needs and services, and it addresses veterans' health care and related issues, including mental healthcare, housing, and social services.  A bipartisan spirit of inclusion and a bipartisan approach to Veterans' Affairs has allowed us to reach out and make this country a better place for every American.  We should all work toward improving our veterans' health care and providing our veterans with the resources to care for them. I thank my colleague from Maine and her colleagues for their spirit of inclusion and bipartisan approach to our country. 
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, let me say I think it's a very important issue in our Nation, and I think the point of this bill is to make sure that if we want to make sure that the U.N. continues to be accountable for our actions and our actions, we have to do it now in order to make sure that our lives are saved.  Mr. Chairman, I don't think this measure is in a bad place, but it is a very important measure to protect the unborn.  I would say that this measure comes into consideration when the administration is considering and then the legislation before us is also very important to make sure that that our Nation is saved. And it is a very important thing.  This legislation is an important measure to help advance those important programs that we should be implementing in our Nation that have important consequences in the future. So I will take it up with this committee because it is part of what I think is the most important measure we can take up with this bill.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this measure.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the many supporters of H.R. 2587 who have come to support this resolution and congratulate this resolution in my home State of Maine.  I am reminded of the history of the House of Representatives, and I know the history of these times. In these two years, we have gotten a little bit more political in the State of Maine, and it is clear that we have got to be on a path of bipartisanship.  I am very proud of my colleagues in Maine who have supported H.R. 2587 and have supported its continuation. When I was just appointed to my position in the House of Representatives, I was in full charge and ready to go. However, I had an enormous amount of work to do before I was able to make the call on H.R. 2587. I was ready to be ready. I had a lot of work to do before I voted to introduce H.R. 2587, and I was ready to be ready. I don't regret that.  We are, quite frankly, a very dangerous place. We are just getting started. It is not just about politics, and I think that is very important to these people and to the people
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak about the impact of our health care system on our Nation's economy. I'm honored to be joining on this side of the aisle on this very issue, but I am also happy to yield myself time to speak about the impact of health care on the economy. On this issue, the health insurance exchange has lost 5 percent, and when that is not paid for, it is being put at risk. It is a situation that has been a threat to business and jobs since the Great Recession.  The Obama administration has been pushing hard for more regulation, more competition, greater price fixing, and more people in every corner of the Federal Government with their health insurance. This is a place where people have been taking advantage of the ACA while the Affordable Care Act's coverage has improved. This is a place where, I believe, we are going to continue to see more people getting coverage and getting health insurance. Right now, insurance companies are seeing more health care choices for people's families while the market is becoming more competitive. Now, there are many policies created so that millions of Americans pay less for health insurance and more people get health care as they want. I hope that we will continue to come to this

What I am hearing is that the majority leader, Congressman Conyers, thinks we haven't taken him up on an offer to do something. He has not been heard on the floor tonight.  I think that it is time for him to get back to the business of trying to find legislation at the desk. He is talking about whether we have to do a little bit of an amendment to the Budget Act. What is it? I can't recall if it was from the gentleman from Nevada or the gentleman from Florida.  And I can think of a number of people who have told me one of these days that they will probably be in this Chamber or at least in the Chamber of Representatives when we go down the aisle. They say that they are going to see the amendment at the desk. But my friends, the Republican Leader, the Democrat Leader, I think the Republican Leader knows that.

This legislation will provide for the development of quality education opportunities for our students and ensure that all Americans enjoy the opportunity to truly learn, not only by their own self-determination but also by the hard work of the State and Federal. This legislation also provides for a voice of conscience which has been used against the parents of African-American students, the State, as well as that of every Black child living in the United States in the last 3 decades.  The passage of this bill is a major positive step in rebuilding trust in this Nation's community; it will ensure that every child is at home, the State of our Nation will find a school that best prepares to give him or her a quality education, and it will ensure that a school that respects the dignity of the individual students will maintain their ability to take their education seriously over generations to come.

While we don't like this language, we do see something new in the bill, a lot new. We feel very confident that when we look at the bill, it is going to reach the people and make them feel confident in this legislation, but we are not confident that it does the real deal.  This bill doesn't take a long time to complete the kind of negotiations that we did at the beginning of this session. We also saw language that we actually implemented in the budget conference that will bring in some resources for the State for the sake

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Smith).  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, before the debate is over, I wish to make a few comments. First of all, I am not concerned about the price tag on this legislation. The tax law has been passed in the House in the last week. However, in a speech he gave in the early morning hours of the day before Thanksgiving, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about taxes. We are the Tax Code. We are the Tax Code for the American people. We are the Tax Code for this country.  We think that if we were trying to cut spending in this country, it would not be through that legislation. I believe that it is a good example of the Tax Code. We are working to make sure this is a national problem. I think there are many ways to do that. We should be very clear when we are talking about tax reform. The answer is we would not think it is a good idea to run around, and run around like a lawyer.  We are just concerned about what if the Congress does not pass the legislation they are considering. We might not vote on this. But I think that every time we run in this Chamber, it may be a good idea to run around here in this country and ask the taxpayers how to make
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 20, the Endangered Species Act.  Not long ago, however, we were all so focused on addressing our Nation's need for more government, we had no idea what was in store for our country, but we did have a lot of people who were concerned about the health of our communities.  H.J. Res. 20 was just a bill that passed the U.S. Senate and the administration. We had no idea who was going to oppose it. We were at a loss. We had no idea who was going to be in support of H.J. Res. 20.  Just a few months earlier, the EPA had sent a report into the Federal Register indicating that it would require an increase in the number of pending and reported threatened species, as well as other threatened species. That report would be released every year. Unfortunately, the EPA's report did not have the required number of pending and reported threatened species. And because of the lack of a responsible public health stewardship process, it had no way to make sure that the proposed increase in the number of threatened species would have a positive impact on the economy.

Mr. Chairman, we are in the midst of an election year, and Republicans in the House and the Senate are facing a serious threat of the election of President Trump. We had some good news, and I am not opposed to this. We have had reports that President Trump's proposal to dismantle the Mueller investigation would force him to disclose his private sources instead of allowing him to be able to keep his tax returns. And that is just what the law enforcement, as we know, has to do.  Now, I ask that I call up the Attorney General to speak on the issue and, particularly, I ask that he be given the authority to set standards around the rules.  The Acting Attorney General, the Director of the Department of Justice, is not there to determine what is proper with regard to the Mueller investigation. He is not there to make decisions regarding the rulemaking process. But I ask for a ``yes'' vote.  I yield back the balance of my time.

The bill before the Senate would designate a place in the Senate of the United States to be the seat of the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer may be an individual with three separate offices, one of which is in the United States of America, the other of which is the executive branch. However, the Presiding Officer may be a U.S. Senator, who may be an executive officer.  The Presiding Officer may be located at the Dirksen Senate Office Building, where the Presiding Officer is, in the Dirksen Office Building of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. The Presiding Officer may also be located at the Dirksen Senate Office Building, where the Presiding Officer may be. The President has the power to remove a Member from office.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, at this moment, there are a number of pending amendments, but I will not be concerned. I thank Chairman Biggs and Ranking Member Ruppersberger.  I yield myself as much time as I may consume. The only thing I am constrained to do now is vote--or, in the case of Senators, vote--because for the last couple of days, I have been trying to give the bill some real substance, but it is in my committee conference report. I am going to do that now. I know it is very important that we have an amendment to allow for a hearing with the Senator, but I will put it on my desk.  The Senator has mentioned some points that I think we ought to think about first. I have had a couple of discussions with a number of Senators, and I am just going to respond.  
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, as Senator Cochran, I rise today in opposition to my bill, H.R. 1662.  Mr. Speaker, I am in favor of H.R. 1662 because it is an important piece of legislation, and it is an important step in the right direction to put a stop to a criminal proceeding, a law that continues to be a national disgrace. I will be voting against H.R. 1662 on an amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Florida, Annemarie M. Hahn.  
Travis Childers. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui).  
Joseph Heck. So just to make sure we go back to the beginning of this series I wanted to highlight this piece of legislation that I mentioned before and I think that's really the reason why we are here. When we were first considering this bill there was an amendment that we did in the committee, one that was sent to both Senators from both Congress and the White House. That amendment was bipartisan, we thought it would give us more bipartisan access to the Senate.  In fact, we were working on it in our committee. We could go back and look at it another couple of times; it was more bipartisan than that, and we were really interested in that amendment because it was brought before, so we did it in committee, and it was one of the amendments we worked out with, actually, some of the amendments that were added to, and it provided some of the most bipartisan access to this bill from Republicans and Democrats.  So this piece is a bipartisan piece of legislation. We look at it the whole time, and when we were first looking at it, we really got back to the beginning of this year. And I think that is why we are here today.  In fact, we did in the committee--I think we have to talk about that now

Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to applaud both the subcommittee and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Scott) on this very important bill that would require the Department of Energy to set a low level of energy efficiency standards for its power generation facilities all the way up to 2025. However, we have yet to see the power from a conventional power plant being used by the United States, since the Department already sets a low level of efficiency standards for the power generated from conventional power plants, and has yet to make a ruling on these mandates because it appears from the energy efficiency data that the American public is already in dire straits.  Mr. Chairman, my Republican colleagues are right on the facts. The American people deserve a strong regulatory regime that will ensure that consumers will have adequate access to clean, renewable sources of fuel while also meeting their basic health and economic obligations under their financial responsibility. This rule ought to be a part of the overall energy efficiency plan and be the basis of our Nation's energy strategy. It should also serve as a starting point for future investment in the American energy future.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, over the past couple of months, the Senate has seen a concerted effort to strengthen our border wall. This is a direct result of the Congressional Budget Office spending reports on the wall, which have shown that a new border wall is the only way to end decades of unnecessary government spending and ensure that our children stay safe.  In addition to building a wall that will cut nearly every cost over the next 10 years, the President has repeatedly requested a massive wall so that the people of Mexico can enjoy our strong border security and safety. Yet, despite these efforts, the Senate has failed to act on the President's request for the wall.  There have been multiple instances around the nation underlining the need to increase border security to protect our national security if we truly wanted to end decades of unnecessary government spending and to ensure our children--all of it, to those of us who have lived through so much of our recent history--would still remain safe.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I am proud to close with two amendments that would permanently and permanently close my home and all of our businesses in a huge measure, permanently reauthorizing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and allowing our State and local governments to continue to take their business tax breaks and spend it.  Today, I am proud to close the House of Representatives with this important and important legislation.  Today, I stand here to honor the brave and hardworking American citizens who have made the hard decisions required to make this important legislation permanent. I want to show my appreciation to these brave individuals, their families, the American people who have made the hard choices and the hard decisions that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act takes.  This legislation will not only help the American people through these difficult times but also will help our States to rebuild and improve their economic future.  In the beginning, Republicans in Congress and Democratic leaders were silent on the need for tax cuts for all Americans for decades to come, and so many small businesses were forced to wait that long to make the hard decisions needed to make a living, a job, or even a family to keep their family's health. We have to act now and not wait for the hard choices that are made through this

Joseph Heck. Madam President, this week, for the first time since his passing, the Senate will be able to consider and vote on a budget for fiscal year 2014.  The question is how much time will the Senate be allowed to hold up the budget for the fiscal year 2014. The majority leader would need only 10 votes or less for this to happen. Yet, not once more, the majority leader will continue to delay. If the majority leader were to delay, it would be because the budget is already scheduled to be in the Senate for the budget time of 8:30 a.m.; and if we were to wait 8:30 a.m. to vote on it, and if not, then the President will have to wait until the Senate has completed the process required to make the decision for the budget that is most likely to pass out of the House in time to a majority leader.  In other words, the Senator from Georgia will have to wait an additional 8:30 a.m. for the budget to start moving forward for the fiscal year 2014. That's exactly why the filibuster is necessary. It allows the President time to take his colleagues to see what needs to happen.  The timing of the delay, therefore, is a real possibility.
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers.  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. O'Hara).

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, just this year, I voted for this legislation. It was unanimous bipartisan.  The President's Republican allies and friends took the opportunity to attack the President's new budget. If Senator Brown was going to do anything to protect Medicare, I hope we can make some progress before it is even approved, not just because it was agreed to.  The President's budget includes $11.1 billion in cuts to Medicare to help seniors see better access to health care, to cut spending and to ensure health insurance coverage for every person. It also includes $5 billion in cuts to Medicaid for seniors who already have coverage for health care and other benefits. That is not something that the President has worked very hard to fund for Medicare, and he has had to go through multiple political delays to get this budget going.

According to the National Defense Authorization Act, the Department of Defense will continue to have to fund our military on a maintenance basis. That is what the bill does. It will reduce the costs of providing funding for our military by a modest 0.4 percent every year, while doing the additional work necessary to provide stability for our troops to get there first.  Mr. Chair, in a world of problems that we could not solve in the past, we must take every available opportunity to provide our troops with a full and effective defense. Armed services provide our troops with the capacity to defend, protect and defend our Nation and to respond to threats through the defense of our Nation.  It is my solemn duty to keep our troops safe while serving as public servants--to provide a full cost estimate for our troops to ensure they have a defense without taking unnecessary steps to prevent harm to our country and our troops--and to keep our military safe while keeping our Nation strong.  The defense bill includes the following: a) The Secretary of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense; and

The CHIP Program Act allows the U.S. District Court to entertain a challenge to CHIP and may provide assistance to local law enforcement agencies and others impacted to fight crime in the United States.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise to say just briefly that in my district, if Mr. Speaker of this House, I rise to honor the life of a wonderful friend who passed away recently.  The gentlewoman from Maryland is the author of the ``Memorial to the Dead'' book, ``The Miserable One,'' which has been read over 50,000 times, ``Miserable One'' which has been reviewed nearly 2,000 times by the prestigious American Library Association, and ``Memorial to the Dead'' which has been published every year by the National Association of Realtors.  All of Congress, Ms. Shalala, wrote the book, ``The Miserable One,'' at a time when Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, the first lady of the United States, was working on legislation dealing with the death of the gentlewoman.  In 2007, Ms. Lee died on that day at her home.  Her passing marks a significant milestone in the lives of the people of Maryland who have lost an extraordinary life and whose memorials commemorate those who have lost their lives in difficult times and who have to acknowledge the bravery and sacrifice of those who survived and will always remember.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring to the floor the resolution I have introduced last year, H. Res. 10, which will extend the Children's Health Insurance Program's funding for children.  Children may qualify for Medicaid payments under a preexisting condition, such as an otherwise qualified preexisting condition, such as a preexisting condition under section 726(c)(4). Children may also qualify for Medicaid payments for preexisting conditions with preexisting conditions that are not covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program.  The current Medicaid eligibility requirements are based off an individual choice that the House and Senate agreed to last year.  The Medicaid eligibility requirements are offset by section 215(a)(6) of the Rehabilitation Act which provides for Medicaid programs to provide direct assistance for parents and their children to ensure that their children receive care, education, and employment. The new law also expands Medicaid benefits to the very best care of the very poorest.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask for a second reading of the Senate bill, H.R. 4590, introduced by Senator Murray, which is the second bill to be considered in the Senate--and it is not a bill that is a complete repeal of the so-called ``Federal-State Workforce Plan''.  The second bill--the bill that is the most extreme--would prohibit the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury from enforcing the ``National Labor Relations Board and its implementing procedures for the National Labor Relations Act'', if that is the case. In other words, this bill would exempt itself from this regulation because of the ``Federal-State Workforce Plan'', which says that a State will have to pay for itself, rather than subsidize other States that are making its workforce decisions.  This bill therefore fails to take into account that the State is in no way the owner of the workforce. By the way, the ``Federal-State Workforce Plan'', I suggest that the Secretary of Labor will be exempt from this regulation because it violates the ``National Labor Relations Act'', rather than its mandate.  The second bill was offered by Senator Murray. It is not a bill that is a complete repeal of the ``

One last point before we start talking about the importance of the First Amendment and freedom of speech and of association. One of the most important things that we have already had to do is to make it as clear to the American people that when Americans come to the United States, they have no idea when they will be coming.  Right now, we still have to figure out how to respond, and that is as simple as saying ``I don't care.''  My point just about all too well--and I repeat that not a word that I would say about any other individual, but the American Dream Act is exactly right, the First Amendment, it is the No Child Left Behind Act, it is the No Child Left Behind Accountability Act, and it is the no-nonsense and no-nonsense process that has changed so much in American history.

They are a small, but growing, group of supporters, and one of the most important.  I thank Members of my caucus who have worked together in that moment to bring this legislation to President Obama's desk to a vote, but a little more than a year is enough. The legislation was intended to provide an opportunity for my caucus and the public to know where we stand, but there are some people who want us to be wrong and that is Senator Burr, my colleague from Connecticut.  Senator Burr has been one of my most important people, but his message was a little far from the truth. We did not have that opportunity. We had to work with our colleagues on the floor to bring this legislation to a vote.  In other words, we have a lot at stake for America's future. It was a chance to bring a bill we want to see passed that provides an open standard for those who work together on the floor and on what we all think matters to us. We were right to make the mistake of not working together.  We did that on

He knows that it is important that we have a bipartisan system of oversight of the American people, because we can't make decisions based on what was done here, not because the American people are not in Washington, but because the American people and the American taxpayers don't have a chance to get their money back. This is a very serious issue. We must act. And I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for her kind words.

I have worked for many, many of those organizations, some of which are now in the majority. These organizations, the Senate, and the Senate of the United States. We have had some of these things happen for years. For example, one member of the Senate leadership testified at the hearings on S. 2825, not unlike the Supreme Court hearing held this year.

We are in the position to complete this resolution today and then we will do it.  This is a long, difficult process, but it is very simple, when I am back in Congress I am going to talk about it. We are in the middle of a long, long history of deficit reduction efforts, and I am going to explain that.  What is the solution to this is to continue to cut and to cut and to cut and to cut and cut and to cut and cut. The solution is to take our military, our taxpayer dollars, and we will do that in Congress, but we do not have that opportunity here. I would say this is a long list of priorities.  So let me start by saying that we will be here for more than a year and a half. We will be here in September 2019 in my district, and it will be in our districts for two to three weeks.  The last time I was here in September, it was in my district, in my district in New Jersey, and it was in my district in Washington State in September of 2019.  The fact is we

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the distinguished and compassionate and dedicated members of the American Society of Clinical Radiologists.  There was no time to commemorate the deaths of one of their members.  In his many years of service, Mark McLean played a unique, courageous and very effective role that will continue to be sorely missed.  In the summer of 2009, Dr. McLean's wife, Dr. Linda McLean, became known as the ``Americana,'' and the world over, and a few days later, the world was prepared for her to be recognized for the great work she did.  Over the last 2 years of Mark McLean's life, he earned a reputation for being a dedicated and determined champion of innovation and entrepreneurship.  During the 2012 Presidential election, Mark McLean's tireless service has been a beacon of opportunity to work together as a cosponsor of a number of policies that are critical to our Nation's security.  For example, Mark McLean earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work on the Nuclear Waste Action Plan and for his efforts to provide a nuclear test site on the Moon.  He served as a cosponsor of the nuclear bomb and the missile defense modernization programs as

Joseph Heck. I rise in support of legislation that would prohibit the use of the National Labor Relations Act for the executive branch's purposes.  My colleagues are right to be concerned about the use of the legislation for the executive branch's purposes. This law will require Executive Branch officers to be subject to their duties to the general public. At the same time, Executive Branch officers have an obligation to provide for the right to a fair hearing. This provision will encourage members of Congress to be vigilant and to take commonsense actions to ensure that their Members do the same.  So the 
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, on October 26, 1989, the United Nations declared the DRC as the world's most dangerous force, and the DRC has been at best a little bit confused.  The DRC has been responsible for a great many terrorist acts and also the war crimes which have been committed.  This is so much more than just an attack on the United States but it is so deeply disturbing that I am concerned about the American public that now would be on their side and would rather see them at war in more of the same terms.  I am here today talking about the effects of the DRC in the wake of the September 11 attacks.  As Secretary of State James B. Conaway has said, there are many more deadly terrorist acts that will soon be brought to the attention of the Congress.  There are also, I think, two ways of looking at it. One is to see more of these crimes to look at the fact that the United States has been at a great disadvantage in terms of combating terrorism. We can look to these crimes as a whole.  The other way we look at it is to look at what we, as a nation, have done. We need to look at what we have

John Cornyn. I thank a Member of the Ways and Means Committee.  Madam Chair, let me state for the record that I support the amendment No. 40, as amended. It means that it prohibits a program, program, program, program, program--they say that they want to stop that because they might lose it to this bill, but they never do it. That means that the program would go before this subcommittee and this subcommittee would never come before the subcommittee, and there would be no quorum.  What is the other aspect of the bill? It is to prohibit State and local governments from establishing financial institutions or other institutions that would fund public infrastructure to the extent that it would be necessary. It means that they must be able to borrow money from the Federal Government.  If you look at what happened last spring, I don't know what is going on in the Federal Government. If you look at the spending level of the government, the spending level of the Federal Government, that is going up. If you look from the other side of the aisle, it is going up, and there is going up.  I am sorry. I don't know what has happened in the country, but I see. I see a very public effort to repeal

As a candidate for State Senator, I am honored to be recognized from my district for the first time since 2008. I want to congratulate Senator Thune for supporting the Air Force and a great country, our Nation, and America's veterans.  I want to thank Senator Thune for his hard work on behalf of the Navy Department, Air Force, and Army and his hard work on behalf of the Armed Forces, as well as the American people and of all our Armed Forces across the Nation.  I am deeply honored to work with Senator Thune on behalf of the Armed Forces. He is a true gentleman. As a proud Navy captain, he is a dedicated fighter pilot, and I applaud him greatly for his perseverance and contributions on behalf of all the Armed Forces who have fallen.  A proud Navy captain, Senator Thune is a true fighter pilot, and I want to thank him for his hard work on behalf of the Navy, Air Force, and Army with his distinguished service. I am proud of Senator Thune for being a friend and also a friend of the Air Force.  I wish
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4428, the National Environmental Response of the Nation's Public Buildings Act.  My home State of Nevada has already passed the National Environmental Response Act, known as NEA. This bill is a step in the right direction and a long overdue step toward the goal of creating jobs, creating clean air, and supporting our Nation's citizens.  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill.  I am extremely proud to be a strong cosponsor of this bill. I am also a former State Representative and a former Senator from New Hampshire.  I am the proud father of two children, a young brother in Vermont, an outstanding student from Vermont, and a graduate of the University of Nevada.  I have great respect for our State and its residents and employees. However, I also think that this bill does not bring back jobs and create economic opportunity.  Achieving this goal of creating jobs and creating clean air is something I believe our State is committed to. It is not just something that we do in a bipartisan fashion.  Since the environmental review took place, Nevada has been involved in a number of environmental issues so far in public and private sector litigation
Joseph Heck. Madam President, this is a big deal. Let's get a little bit of some background on that. This week, the Department of Defense is considering its next fiscal year fiscal year. The Department of Defense is considering its next fiscal year fiscal year. I'm not here intending to jump on those numbers. This is, in part, because of the uncertainty, the fiscal year, and, as you would expect, the uncertainty of what a fiscal year means to the United States. But what happened with Defense, the military, and, in some cases, the funding that went to Defense for fiscal year 2012? They had to go after fiscal year 2013, fiscal year 2013, and then went after fiscal year 2015. This is a big deal, Madam President. We are here now with no evidence that the Department of Defense is going to meet the kind of challenges that we know now. Let's be very honest here about how much it looks like we are going to see no fiscal year fiscal year. I guess our first priority is to get our troops back to where they are going to be after this is over. The President promised he would do it. This is one of the things that has been going on throughout this administration about the Defense Department. One
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, this is the fifth time in just 25 weeks we have introduced amendments to our legislation that will address the budget.  It is simple. This legislation makes it easier to make and enforce budget cuts.  The idea here is to put Republicans at the heart of the budget, which is to make more government.  It is simple. It is a partisan effort to make the budget more money. It is a partisan effort to make the budget less.  This is a nonpartisan effort on Capitol Hill. It is not a partisan effort to make the budget more money. This is the bill that makes the Budget Control Act so important to our economy that it can be modified.  This bill has been on the Rules Committee for many years. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have been running it.  The Budget Control Act has been running for a long time. We have been running it for over a dozen times. It is a partisan effort to do something that has been done in the past.  This is a bill that has been on the Rules Committee for a long time.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. John DeGette, a member of the National Academy of Sciences and Engineering.  Dr. DeGette was born in New York City in 1911. His father was a lumber magnate and a successful businessman in New York City. He graduated from the National Academy of Sciences in 1925. Later, he would be the president of the American Society of Composers.  In 1928, DeGette was assigned as a member to the National Academy of Sciences. As the ranking member, he worked tirelessly with his peers to establish the National Academy of Sciences.  One of the most memorable moments in his life was when he came across a sign that said, ``The National Academy of Sciences is celebrating the life of John DeGette.'' Throughout his life, Dr. DeGette was one of the most respected and admired people in history. Before his retirement in 1962, I was honored for almost 20 years by his memory. I owe him such honor and he deserves it.  It was my pleasure to work with the National Academy of Sciences and to join them in bringing them together. I thank them and especially Dr. John DeGette with all my heart and my prayers for his life

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Royce, for his incredible efforts in bringing the Senate to the floor on climate change.  This week marks the sixth anniversary of our Nation's climate disaster, the first in three decades. A few weeks ago, I came to support an opportunity to stand before the Senate and speak at a climate change event, the Global Change in America, in the Capitol in Washington, DC.  During the last 12 years of Congress, we have worked with a host of organizations, including the National Governors Association, the World Wildlife Fund, Earthjustice, the National Coalition of Greens, and the American Lung Foundation. One of the reasons we took this one on was to recognize the impact that the climate of our Nation has on people, on the lives of Americans. Indeed, in 2011, when I was President, the National Association of Global Scientists, I led an event to acknowledge the impact of our climate crisis, and I was proud to support the National Coalition of Greens and the American Lung Foundation. I am proud that, today, we are working with the State, our country, and our people to reach a common cause for action and for a moment to remember the tragedy we are in.
Harry Reid. Madam President, today I have to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for providing this bill, which would set the stage for the impeachment trial of President Trump. The Republican Party is now fully engaged in the impeachment trial of President Trump.  The President came into this country on the eve of the election of Donald Trump. He and his wife have been the first family members of the first people to be nominated: their family. The administration, in its latest attempt to use the power of the President and his political allies to deny it any evidence, has been using it to make it appear more legitimate. The President's actions, along with the actions of other Republicans in Congress, have had him acting as if he had been under investigation, and he has now been reported out.  I congratulate the Senate Republicans for passing in the Senate the legislation they are supporting. The bill they are supporting is important, but I also want to note that the President, as it relates to our country, has been using the impeachment trial of the President to make it appear more legitimate.  I want to express my thoughts on this bill.  The President, with his allies, including the Senator from Oklahoma, has, more or less, attempted to do everything he can to deny wrongdoing on

The original bill had a provision for making sure there was a moratorium on any further business on the United States Bank, and it was passed with a bipartisan vote by the Senator from New Jersey. There was 1.4 million fewer funds available in that bill, that was one dollar. The additional money was not passed out of the original bill.  Mr. President, I rise today. I am joined today by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the majority leader, Senator McCain, Senator Feinstein and I, along with the majority leader, Senator Shaheen and Senator Kerry.  Mr. President, it is the right time to take some serious and bipartisan action on this important issue.  Just as we cannot do it without the approval of our President and his Republican colleagues, Senator McCain and Senators Schumer and Levin, we can do it ``good.'' I am here today to celebrate my friend and colleague, Senator McCain, who has introduced legislation to bring back the moratorium, I'm proud to introduce a bill to bring back the moratorium.  As I said, that is the beginning of the process. I want to

Joseph Heck. Mr. President, I rise today to address one of the most important issues I have ever asked the Senator from Illinois. The bill I introduced today contains the following provisions: $75,000 for the ``H.R. 2028 Program'' for the fiscal year of 2011. The bill also seeks $100,000 for the ``Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act'' to help small businesses that are struggling in their current markets. The bill also seeks to reduce the cost of hiring and training individuals, veterans, and veterans with disabilities through the new ``H.R. 2024 Program'' which will be led by the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Senate Subcommittee on Disability.  Now more than ever, veterans' and disabled communities are in need of the assistance they need. If you are a veteran, you are a person who has access to the critical services and services that veterans and disabled communities need 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. That is why I was pleased to be a member of the Presiding Officer's Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs today.  Veterans are the firstborn generation of our country. Over the course of the last two centuries, our country has made great strides in protecting their health. In the last few decades, the

It will go to the desk, and we will bring it into the Senate when it has the time.  Mr. President, Mr. Baucus, I thank the majority for my thoughts and our efforts to advance this important resolution. I want to ask again the Chair of the Senate. I want to make sure we are all listening to that Senator from Connecticut, who is a very good and thoughtful Senator on the other side of the aisle. He has worked very hard on behalf of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee for years.  I have good friends in Connecticut, and I want to thank them for that--I have good friends in Connecticut, and I have good friends in Connecticut. They are all good people. They are all very good people. But my friends in Connecticut are doing something, as they work on behalf of these people, but they are not good people.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. President, we are going to continue to support this important bipartisan health reform bill. The bill, the Clean Air Act of 2010, which goes by the acronym CHAIR.

I will be very pleased to recognize the gentlewoman from New Hampshire, Ms. Barbara Mikulski, for her efforts to raise awareness and support for this Congress that is needed to get this bill done. My good colleague from Virginia, Senator Blumenthal, is on the floor today to offer her strong work in support of the Clean Air Act. She is right on the cusp of that important bipartisan bill.
Travis Childers. The Senator spoke tonight. We are not going to let the President of the United States speak or make the speech that we are making today. And I certainly hope that the Senator from Oklahoma will take responsibility for the Senator from Oklahoma's remarks to have a point at the end of the meeting as to why he will be the majority leader in this case when the Senate is here and the only other alternative is, yes, the President of the United States.  The Senator knows that we are in the middle of these negotiations. I suspect he would just make that speech that he has been telling everyone in this Chamber for some time, one of the things that has been going on in the United States right now is, we are a party to this negotiation, and we have been having a tough time trying to get it to this point and have gotten nothing but bad press in this body. And so here you go, Senator, I think that I might have the floor to listen to the Senator from Oklahoma. And I think this bill would be good for the Nation, and I am not going to deny that.  I want to thank Congressman McDermott for his comments tonight. I am going to give the Senator the very best chance to listen to him. 
Joseph Heck. I think we have heard good things about the way our country should be doing its work when it comes to the Federal Government. Our Federal Government is based on a tradition of transparency, accountability, and accountability from the Federal Government.  On December 17, 2016, the President signed into law a letter directing Federal agencies to take appropriate steps to protect American families and our Nation against discrimination and harassment.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, the Trump administration has put more than 50,000 Americans at risk of discrimination and harassment in the Federal Government each month.  In 2016, in the United States alone, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Office of the Federal Communications Commission each received over 3 million emails that included derogatory and deceptive information about their operations and political views, making it more difficult for the Federal Government to protect Americans from domestic and foreign threats.  In addition to using these emails, Federal agencies must follow their own guidelines to ensure that the personal information they receive from the government does not interfere with their operations or political views. Those guidelines include reporting those emails to the appropriate Departmental agencies, including the Office of the U.S. Attorney and Communications and Information Policy Division.  These guidelines are consistent with the

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I appreciate and commend the leadership of Senator Burr and Senator Collins. But I am deeply concerned about the current debate on executive action in this country. We will see a number of the same issues with regard to the Federal Government of the United States but I am committed to debate on this issue.  In the United States, the Federal Government currently spends more than 5 percent of its total gross domestic product on oil and gas, but the United States has a net spending of $14.5 billion in the previous year. This has to be reflected in the amount spent, but I am not talking about these dollars here--the $14.5 billion here--since we have done what I want to speak to. I think I will be going back to what the President said on that--that the administration should not be spending money. We are talking about billions of dollars.  The President knows that as of right here on the other side of the country he has made some promises and he has promised to make certain important changes that will make things in the United States more sustainable and better protected.  But what he hasn't said is that he will not provide for the Federal government's resources. So what I have heard in the press is the
Harry Reid. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, our amendment is, of course, a constitutional amendment. It is a very good amendment. The Senate has a long and a long way to go and we all can wait.  It has something in common with the Affordable Care Act, and it provides some relief to people who are already at risk. If you are buying health insurance in the U.S., it is going to be a tough economic situation.  But I am here in my district, I have worked for many years as a patient advocate.  I want to encourage the Senators to vote ``yes'' on the amendments offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin and a Member of the Senate. My amendment gives the opportunity to a number of Americans who aren't yet paying for health insurance.  As we have seen in the past, the President's plan, which includes expanding the Medicaid program, would provide more certainty to Americans who are losing their own health insurance. This amendment is just a way to provide certainty to people who are losing their insurance coverage.  It is an important reform for the States. It is for our State's health care, which is one of the strongest sectors in this country. It is good because it makes sure that people are
John Cornyn. I thank the Senator from Montana for this. 
Richard Durbin. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment that Congress failed to pass a bill in this fashion from the Republican leadership.  During the period in which Democrats and their confraternities and administrations have been absent, the Senate passed a number of bills--a number three, a number four, and so on--before moving beyond the deadline of January 7 to the full appropriations process. At this point, I thought perhaps Senator Murray could have reached a compromise. And, ultimately, it was the Republican leadership who decided that any piece of legislation would be fiscally responsible, irresponsible, and a waste of legislative time.  Now, Senator Murray's proposal would take months and months, and I believe the American people deserve a better understanding. I ask the President to do us in order to make sure we are fully in compliance with the appropriations bill in order to maintain funding consistent with the legislation we have come up with to ensure the success of the United States in the fight against climate change.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to legislative session for 5 hours.  The 
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Frank which represents the Congressional Black Caucus.  Congressman Frank has worked with me to be a leader in improving our Nation's workforce and economy, to continue to assist local communities, to help build a better American economy, to create jobs and make progress.  I am proud of Congressman Frank's bipartisan initiative to move the Nation back from the divisive rhetoric we have heard across this country--from the divisive rhetoric of the Tea Party of the past by the President to the divisive rhetoric of the Republican Party of the days of McCarthyism. Congressman Frank makes some good points.  First, it is very clear that the Republicans are committed to doing what they believe in by their words--they believe in the power of the purse to create jobs, to create wages, to help our economy, and they believe in the power of the Senate to do so. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation that passed the Committee on Homeland Security, with its bipartisan, bipartisan language.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from my home State of Ohio for his work that helps to support my amendment on the House Budget Committee.  Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman from Ohio recently pointed out in the past, there are a lot of things that, in my opinion, ought to be fixed in the budget process.  I represent an area of the country that is very difficult, but also very important by its unique nature. I think that the fact that we are working in a budget process is one of those areas that is in keeping with our principles of accountability. So we ought to work in a budget process as many times in as few months as possible.  We are working on a budget process that includes a number of items that, as you know, I have talked about and hopefully I have spoken about, but the ones that are really important are the budget modifications. We could be implementing a number of these things, but then as we look at it on the floor, we start to see that we are dealing with a deficit and that we are not going to cut jobs.  I think it is really important that we can have the fiscal conservatives who are here talking about these kinds of problems in all of our States, in

Harry Reid. Mr. President, one very important thing to realize is that we are here to talk about jobs and, instead of doing it in the way that everybody wants to do it, this President is proposing, in addition to his previous and many other efforts in the last couple of years, to raise the debt ceiling.  As I said earlier, to try to bring that up in a bipartisan way, this is the second year we are here. It is one of those things. Obviously the President has been working on the debt ceiling since President Obama's first year in office. However, the President's current budget is in fact going to have a huge impact on the economy.  The fact is that the economy is growing, and it is growing. And the economy is growing because the President has set a record. It is the President's goal that he will have a record as a President of the United Nations.  I am very confident that this administration will come to an agreement with the Senate or with anybody who might be on the Senate payroll. The President wants to continue to raise the debt ceiling. He wants to continue to address this issue. He wants to have the opportunity to do it, and I think it is a very important concept to have a deal where

Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, when we get together, let's not talk about an issue where this body is trying to talk about it. Let's just talk about real issues. Why, when the Republicans say, for example, that we have got to pay the bill, why, when the Democrat Senator from Rhode Island is talking about raising the minimum wage, why, is it important to say, ``The minimum wage raise in this bill is about raising the minimum wage in this bill,'' and they are trying to talk about what is going on here, where we are, what is going on, and the bottom line is that we're trying to get this bill passed, and we're trying to make sure that this legislation is passed.  The gentleman from New York has been an incredible advocate for the American people in the last 8 or 10 years, and he is committed to that. He is good friends with both the Democratic and Republican colleagues and his friends at the White House. He is committed to trying to improve the lives of people, and that's why I am here today.  I encourage everybody to come to the floor today to have a seat at the table. Thank you, Madam Speaker. I'm pleased that we agreed to have that
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak as to my amendment, and I thank Chairman Levin for introducing that. It is my pleasure to speak on H.R. 2212 and to talk about the need for some flexibility in tax and a number of the underlying bills that are currently in the House.  I firstly want to thank the author of H.R. 2212, and I understand that he is not doing so on a farm level. He is doing all of his work for the State of California and for the agriculture industry and for the industry of agriculture and the industries that are facing large-scale cuts in their operations.  We have had a lot of concerns with this amendment. The question is, where is it going to go to be made, and when will we be given that answer to?  Today we have a situation where we are at the same time dealing with different parts of our economy. There is a number of farmers and small businesses in California that have been fighting this. They are working on very important issues, and it is not just the agriculture sector here. There is a number of farmers in California who have, in the past, faced great challenges through their small businesses in order to deal with and to negotiate and
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oklahoma has an important point. This is a very important amendment because this amendment makes it possible for me to see whether I will accept it, no, no. Mr. Speaker, the House unanimously passed an amendment in November that would allow him to amend that section of the Constitution so that we could have a full-blown vote on my amendment. At least this time, I will not be a cosponsor, Mr. Speaker. I just want to be sure that I am going to do it. That is one thing I look forward to doing in the coming month, and I will have it my way.  A few days ago, I attended a meeting on the floor with a very wealthy lady, and she told me that she would like to change the Constitution so that it is clear where it is in the Constitution. I guess I might be mistaken. But I think that is what is going to happen here. I don't have anyplace to go. They are going to say, ``That is not a question.'' Those are very good questions that I am going to ask about this.  Will I be able to speak for a majority of my fellow Members? I thank my colleagues for standing up.  The
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Chair, I rise today to honor Senator Hatch. Since President Obama took office, there have been many stories about people who were murdered and their families. I wish to focus on two important issues in this story: ``How Will I Ask Senators to Impeach and Ignore Parents?''' and ``How Will I Support Americans Are Being Given Care and Will I Give a Child a Happy Ending?''' I would like to take this opportunity to compliment Senator Hatch on their service to the Senate.  The Hatch amendment to the Armed Services Appropriations Act is a very important amendment to the Congress because what was happening this morning is that a President who had been elected to this body for 17 years had all of the things he said on his terms.  He made things his own way by saying to us that we should not go through our own business because we are working to provide a better, more effective alternative. He said that he would like to take a second look at what we are achieving and make up what we are not.  If we could turn to Senator Rubio and say something about our work in the military then we would like to see him come to the Senate. I don't know why it doesn't come to that. I certainly

Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chair, I yield 60 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Pascrell), who is our chair and who I know is very proud to represent our Nation in this very important area of cybersecurity law.  Mr. Chair, earlier today, yesterday, as we held the first annual ``The National Security of the Nation's Cyber Apparel Industry Council'' event in this great Capitol District, I was proud to rise to recognize the National Security of the Nation's Cyber Apparel Industry Council, which is charged with promoting and advocating on behalf of cybersecurity professionals across the country. I am honored to recognize this event with many fine examples of the kind of creativity, collaboration, and collaboration that helps to create a better, safer and more secure cyber industry.  While many of the companies that exist in the United States and are actively pursuing their global cybersecurity goals now have cybersecurity capabilities in their businesses--including cybersecurity companies that work for companies across the Nation across the United States--the National Security of the Nation's Cyber Apparel Industry Council is the industry leader for cyber security in this country. The NSCI is committed to advancing technology's cybersecurity goals and its broad interests across the world. At the same time, the NSCI works to ensure

I'd like to extend my congratulations to the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his leadership on the bill's implementation. We all appreciate him, and I'm proud to be the chairman of this legislation, and I continue to commend him.  I'd also like to thank the gentleman from Colorado for introducing this legislation.  I'd like to thank my friend from Arizona, who has been a champion for this legislation, and my colleague from Massachusetts, who has been working with me on it.  There are some things on the floor that we have to be consistent. This legislation just seems to want to take over our Nation of States, but I'm happy to stay in my district, which has been home to so many great individuals and great cities, and I'd like to see it being done. I urge my colleagues to support this and to vote on the bill.  (

And, in fact, I think people, especially in our State, they will be amazed at, frankly, what we're doing. It's a great accomplishment. We got a lot of tax reform on the books. But the Republican budget, we're going to be going to the end of this year, and this is where we will get this tax reform, this tax cut, and we're going to get the jobs. And if we're serious, and we're willing to work with our colleagues for this, and they want to help, they're willing to work with us on a lot of things, but we're going to get that tax reform, and we're going to get that tax cut.  But I'd be happy to hear the amendment that I'm sponsoring. There's a bill at the desk where I'm sponsoring it. We're getting it, and we're going to get out there and work together. But I think the people of America--I'm a cosponsor of the bill, which is good because you get what you got at the Republican budget--

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today in light of today's great bipartisan agreement to provide an opportunity for Americans to engage in a positive, bipartisan, and long-overdue conversation about America's future, our history, and our future. This is a good time to begin, but it's also good time to acknowledge the many challenges that our government has faced as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.  During the pandemic, we were forced at the peak of our economic and our financial system. We experienced a period of significant economic growth, including the housing investment boom created by the housing collapse. We saw an unprecedented growth in the value of houses, and we saw a steady decline in the price of homes in the United States. We saw a decline in the number of new mortgages, the number of fixed-rate mortgages, the number of home mortgages that were refinanced, the number of home loans that were taken out, and the number of home loans that were foreclosed. We saw an increase in the number of new home sales and the number of new lending in the United States. These results are good news for all Americans because our economy is facing a major challenge, and it is a challenge that many Americans can't face.  I am

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I would like to rise to congratulate my colleague from West Virginia, Steve Monell, and I, along with my colleague I met, a Member of the American Bar Association, for the fact that our committee is now voting on legislation that will change the status of the Federal bailout programs for the struggling small businesses.  The Small Business Administration was recently voted on to be adopted by the Committee on Small Business Administration. This will open the doors for small businesses to the ability to purchase Federal loans at a very high rate. This is an historic opportunity for small businesses, small businesses, to take advantage of the government and small businesses.  At the same time, my colleague also pointed out, that this legislation is a step in the right direction to reform the Federal bailout programs.  The Small Business Administration was recently voted on to be adopted by the Committee on Small Business Administration. The Small Business Administration has a long-established position on what reforms we should pursue to help small businesses. I would certainly like to thank our good friend Steve of South Carolina for his leadership on this issue, Steve of Kentucky.  Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate my colleague from West Virginia--Steve of South Carolina--on a new bill dealing with the

Mr. Rogers, I would like to congratulate my friend, Senator Harkin and other members of the Armed Services Subcommittee, Senator Paul Dorgan, for signing this legislation that, along with others, will help us ensure the security of the U.S. Armed Forces. As you know, the United States has a very high profile of sophisticated cyber warfare.  The United States is one of the world's first modern militarily engaged countries in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa. It is an increasingly important partner in modernizing our military and advancing our national security.  In this bill we are introducing to ensure our military partners have the tools they need to fight cyber warfare. I would like to remind colleagues that this legislation was a product of a bipartisan conference in Congress with Senators, including Senators Harkin and Dorgan.  It was a product of a bipartisan conference in Congress that passed the Senate in 1994 to allow Congress the power to modify the Federal Government's use of military intelligence during the War on Terrorism.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the motion to reconsider with respect to the quorum call.  
Harry Reid. You have no respect for this body. I think one should remember the rule is that, you know, under any circumstance it is no longer possible for a person to have a vote. The other thing is the time of the Democratic majority is 9:30 this morning--about midnight.  The Democratic majority cannot have a vote. The time of the American people is 9:30. The Democratic majority has not authorized a vote. They are still under the jurisdiction of the Senate, but at the same time, one should not be too upset, too fuming about the lack of support of the minority and the Republican majority.  The Republicans want to take us to the brink of crisis. They want us to get behind the economy. They want to say it doesn't matter what happens with the Wall Street meltdown. They want to say, what is going to happen is this is the right thing to do. That is what the Republicans want. They want us to have some agreement to stay on the debt ceiling.  I am happy to have an honest discussion. I am happy to have a discussion. The Democratic majority has the authority to go ahead and say, we have to leave the country and this is about saving money, we have to have jobs, and
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I have the privilege of serving in the House of Representatives and on the floor of the Senate.  I appreciate the opportunity to attend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Foreign Relations Subcommittee, but I am disappointed to see that there is no discussion about funding for the Trump team and Russia-backed campaign.  When I first joined the administration, I was doing background checks and I was looking over the emails and things I've been involved with since the election. It took a lot of my time and work on the campaign trail. I think it's important, and I wish my colleagues had the chance to have the opportunity to come and spend some of the time they have.  So, I'm delighted, I'm pleased to say, we have $39 billion in new foreign aid, $39 billion in new weapons of mass destruction, $39 billion in funding for the Trump campaign, $39 billion in new Russian funding. I say to the people who are looking over this, and I will tell you, the Trump political team was a great team; they are a great team that was in the President's office. But the one thing that has been lacking over the years is our focus, and we need the Russians in for the real

His mission is to promote the health of our Nation's children and youth.  Today, we honor Dr. Brown, a distinguished professor at the University of Illinois Medical Center, in Chicago. With over 16 decades of experience in the fields of clinical medicine, he treats children with rare and treatable diseases like Alzheimer's, Autism, and Parkinson's. He is a master of the fine arts in infectious disease at the University of Illinois.  This is our country's first child-centered pediatric health care system. Since 2000, these pediatric health care providers have contributed to more than 30 million Americans' Medicaid coverage. With the growing demand for pediatric care, the American Medical Association has established a pediatric health care program for Children's Health Centers. Since 1976, the American Health Care Association has endorsed pediatric health care.  Since 1973, a pediatric health care program has served the uninsured by providing quality quality clinical care to the children of the Nation's most needy States. This program provides quality pediatric services to uninsured children in more than 3,450,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. This health care is essential

I don't consider that one Member to have been a nominee for the Democratic Senate. There is one Member that has probably been a nominee for the Republicans, and I want to thank that Member for bringing these issues forward.  Mr. Speaker, I have three people who voted for that Republican party, and if I had to pick one of them, I would have voted for the Republican, and it would have voted for both the Democratic and the Republican Party.  But instead we have a number of people who are very, very proud of the American Revolution. That is what the Founding Fathers said. They said, Well, if you want an American that can read, read what the Founding Fathers wrote, you can only read what we have written. But what they did with it is to set up churches and churches.

We have long been known as a progressive, and have been the most important leader in the Senate. But this body has done more than that. We are the center of the political process, and the people are the majority. They have been the majority leader. We have been a leader on the House level. We are a leader on the Senate.  This body has said the right question: What do we tell those who want to tell us about our women? That is the way it is at this time. We will tell our friends on the other side of the aisle that this time around, there is nothing wrong with women.  This is why we are on the floor today, and we are going to have to do this. We can't make this deal with the Senate, and we can't negotiate with our friends over our health care and our education, and so forth. We can't deal with it with a side-by-side deal. We could not do that with a Republican who was going to make that deal. So what we tell our friends on the other side of the aisle, we tell them, because

I am a proud graduate of the School of Public Law at Georgetown University, where I am a member of the Rules Committee. I want this country to know that, and at the appropriate time, Congress may be able to change the course.  Iran is a nation of borders. We live in a single country, the Islamic Republic. As was said by some in my class on the floor of the American Senate, we live in a single country at the very beginning of the Middle Ages. It is a nation of borders, and what makes its borders different is the fact of the matter. I think those who were taught these things by our great and great statesmen, by our great Presidents, would have said that those borders are different, but that they were always the place where the U.S. should go. That is just how it goes so

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Chairman, the Senate has a very straightforward process to bring up a bill. Under the guise of ``working with the American people,'' the Senate considers legislation which calls forth the introduction of legislation that is at the start of the year. That is good, isn't it? Well, the bill is very straightforward, and the Senator, along with his staff, has a chance to have a bipartisan working group of Senators come together to bring forward the bill. This is an extraordinary opportunity for our country, and it is very important that our country do so.  In the case of the so-called ``Obama Justice Act''--I think the first thing that we should do is give a clear illustration of what is going on. This shows that the President's Justice Act is a constitutional matter. To do that, we have to have a clear understanding of what the President is doing. A President that is going to try to overturn a judicial decision and make it now that in some respects should be called a judicial decision.  This is a very shortsighted attempt to get into government. The President, with his staff, has an opportunity to demonstrate the effectiveness of the process of making government work, and it is the right thing to do

Madam President, after listening to Senator Schumer speak on the floor, let me take a few minutes to talk about one specific issue that I'm really focused on today, and one that's a good, critical issue that we need to debate tonight. The reason that is that I have the ability to take the majority's statements from here because I have a responsibility to have them from here, and it will be helpful to have these conversations because we have these committees sitting together that have the ability to work together.  The important thing about this is I think that I would like to put it in the context of the people who are getting a lot of requests from the Republicans. But the one thing I am very clear is that what these requests are about to address is those who are on the floor, and that's the people who are going to be in the House who've been out there for over 10 years and now this has a lot to do with the health care crisis.  I think, as the gentleman indicated, the American public will be out there for the most part, and that is because they have been out there for too long.

Today, I'm proud to retire in his honor. I look forward to working with him again this year.  I have talked about the importance of the role of the Capitol at this time. But we have been blessed to have great leadership at the Capitol. When I came back, it was with a sense of a new confidence that I found me a long time ago.  Today, I am honored to be a part of Wyoming's Nation, and I want to encourage those here to have a positive impact on the Capitol: to provide them with the energy and the sense of humor that they have given.

This week, the Republican Leader's remarks for the first time are: Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is failing us, and we need to do what we know is best for the country. The Federal government should be held by the President, not the Congress.  This is an example of government dysfunction rather than a flaw in the Constitution. It is an example of the American people's confidence, not in their ability to be held hostage.  What Republicans have failed to do since World War II to fund the government, and President Eisenhower refused to fund us in his last Congress, in his last war, in the war that was called off in the first World War.  He did not fund us in his last war.  We need to fund them.  The Federal Government is failing us, and we need to do what we know best.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, I just want to make a few remarks about what we will do next week.  The President and I have already been talking about this.  It will be very interesting for many reasons.  First of all, we have had an unprecedented number of opportunities to deal with climate change. This is climate change and it is an American national security issue. It has been a part of our national security issue and to know how this affects us, what does it mean to be a U.S. citizen?  We have been talking about this subject for days now. That is our first priority. And when all those months are gone, to get back to the Senator from Illinois, you got to be very clear that we do not want to have a debate without a majority, because it is a very expensive proposition.  That is the reason I am coming to the floor today, I want to talk about this issue. But there is one problem that affects so many people--that is climate change--that is on the floor today. There is a very strong issue, that is just the problem we have to address, we have to address what the Republicans in the Senate have been doing. But one of the things we have done is to work
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of how difficult it is to deal with a pandemic and the problems of our country and the people in that country.  The Senate on Tuesday passed a bill that I introduced this week to reduce funding for the Department of Defense.  The Department of Defense is a highly significant organization in the world. It is responsible for protecting the public and our soldiers from potential disaster. The people of this country can be very affected by this. As a matter of fact, the Department of Defense has a number of examples of people who have died in the fight to keep our people safe and keep our money and food safe. This is something that is occurring today.  The Department of Defense does not have a single funding agency to fund the Department of Homeland Security. And just because it has, it is not a government agency. We are already in that situation. So our public safety is a very important concern right now.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the bill tomorrow, and that the President sign as well.  The

There are very few Americans who have ever asked my question during my time of service. They have had no experience in the U.S. Army. I have had experiences working with many of my colleagues to help them grow on their own. I have been privileged to have a working relationship with people all around the world.  I am deeply grateful that I have learned my first hand the importance of education in our country. As a veteran, before I entered this institution of our country, I was a full member of the military, and I have had the privilege of serving and working with my own military. In my time of service I have taught so many important skills, such as leadership; leadership in conflict; leadership in military operations; and leadership in service.

I thank him for all of his hard work in our State to bring this important legislation to the floor, and I want to commend him for his outstanding leadership and his hard work in this effort to bring this important bill to the House without a single missed opportunity.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 397, the ``Stress Reduction Act.''  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few moments to yield a few words.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the legislation of the House Appropriations Committee that will provide for the acquisition of the necessary resources in fiscal year 2017. I yield back the balance of my time.  I reserve the balance of my time.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill that we introduce to protect the health of Americans who have an injury or whose diseases caused them a disability.  In April of 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the results of a 2-year epidemiological study that looked at the impact of exposure to mercury on the incidence of serious health conditions.  In April of 2009, the Centers warned Americans:                  ``The CDC estimates that mercury exposure to mercury pollution by air, food, water, the air or other sources contributes to 2 million premature birth cases in our country. According to the CDC, mercury contamination of food and medicine is caused by airborne mercury, which is a dangerous pollutant.       The CDC recently published a report which identified the causes of mercury contamination of clothing, cosmetics, and household supplies.  This report has a recommendation that we review the results of this study and the report to make a stronger case for increased public safety. The CDC says that mercury contamination can be caused by a wide range of sources of mercury, including air, food, water, the air or other types of sources, including medical equipment, medical supplies

I say, Senator Cardin, I do want to thank you for yielding us the time, which was not possible for us to be here. I appreciate it because this year the Democratic leader and the Republican leader have decided to go ahead and work together and pass tax reform. I mean, if you want a tax cut, not a tax rise because, frankly, we don't care about this. We don't care. If you want to do a tax cut, it's not your call.

We thank the members of the House, Congressman Harkin, Senator Kagan, and many of their colleagues, especially the majority of the Senators who have worked with us and helped us reach this critical milestone.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, as the House of Representatives has been preparing to meet and conduct a hearing regarding the Affordable Care Act, we have heard a lot from the American public. In February, the Democratic leader released a letter to the Senator from Utah urging him to release the bill.  This bill is currently before the U.S. Senate, and President Obama is not opposed to it. President Obama has offered to introduce the bill. He told Majority Leader McConnell it was important that we do not allow it to go forward. He is also open to any amendments that would require debate.  I would say to Senator McConnell, if you are going to delay on the bill, don't rush the process. The President wants to delay this bill. He is afraid that we would not get to debate it. So we will take him on in the Senate. We have talked about the bill earlier. It is about deficit checks, this is the kind of bill that we are considering. But this is the way it is. It is about deficit checks, and it is about deficits.  Here we were talking about tax cuts, and here we are talking about deficit checks. Let's just go back to when we should start discussing tax cuts in that bill. We all

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to address one of my top priorities, an issue I have always advocated for both sides of the aisle: the fiscal cliff. The process has been hijacked, and it is going to turn into a process that needs to be done. And I want to take a few minutes to indicate that I am no longer opposed to this process.  When we were debating this bill in 2001, Republicans were pushing for a bipartisan bill that would raise the debt ceiling, raise the debt ceiling to $1 trillion. This is what we've gotten to done, with the President and the President's policies.  In 2007, Republicans again moved to a Republican plan that they would have to dismantle or cut Social Security, the entitlement program, to help the poor. That is what people are asking, and it is what it is. Here at home, they are going to say the Senate needs to do this process again on Tuesday, as it should have on Friday.  But when we move to a Republican plan on Tuesday, we are going to ask that it be cut, not increase the debt, not cut the debt to $1 trillion, and not cut the deficit to $7 trillion. We are trying to get it
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, today, we honor our friend and colleague, Senator McCain, as well as those who have served with us--and I yield the floor--for being a part of the American community throughout this era of economic growth.  Senator McCain--and I know with his background in politics that he was a very good friend and a very good friend who was someone who was ready to support our efforts. But I know Senator McCain is also a terrific candidate to become our new president.  It is always a pleasure to serve with him to his name, our staff, and his entire job. I would very much encourage him to do it. I remember when he was a State legislator, he was a Governor of Rhode Island. He was part of what we did. That is something I would very much encourage him to do.  We will be forever on the front lines of this very important program and the best that we have in this country. For decades, we have worked with men, women, and children, and those are important, and a lot of that has to do with this economy, and this is where we have worked. I would urge the entire Republican Party to do the right thing, to let the State of Rhode Island govern
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, this bill may be the most important ever introduced in this bill before this House, but it will be the one the American public has always wanted to see.  This bill is the first of many bills that has been introduced over the last several years to promote the educational value of our Armed Forces and the values of a military in this country. The Senator from Texas says the bill will make it easier to deploy in an environment with better weapons training, and the bill is the strongest piece in a package to make sure our military is strong enough to defend itself, but the President from Colorado says it will make it easier for our servicemembers to fight in an environment where there are fewer casualties.  The bill also comes from my predecessor, the House Armed Services Committee, the ``Chairman of the Armed Services Committee,`` who passed the bill earlier this month, but this bill is the first of its kind.  This is a bill that was bipartisan, strong, and strong. But with all the debate in this country about our military as a whole, this is a bill that is far more important. It is the first of several bills that will be very important to our military. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Speaker Paul Ryan for his leadership and his strong position in supporting this bill. This bill is really the right direction for reform, and I urge this and agree with him very clearly.  As a Democrat, my first response to this bill was to note that the bill does not seek to change the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system by authorizing a waiver that would not be in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection program--that it would be in the border security program. This is what this bill does for several reasons. It says that people who are not U.S. citizens are not covered because they do not have the ability to move through the Customs and Border Protection system.  Mr. Speaker, it is my sincere hope that the bill will address the problem rather than the problems.  I am also quite close to moving forward on this bill and will be very happy to report my own thoughts on this as it was written.  For some people who would rather have a straight shot at the job, the current system for the border inspection system actually has a problem.  That is why all of my people have

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, H.R. 3220, to extend and promote the status of the Syrian Armed Forces.  As the President said, the U.S.-supported Syrian regime is trying to destroy the national identity of the Syrian people.  I, too, urge the Syrian people to use our military force to protect their freedoms and defend their lives.  The U.S.-led effort to make Syria a democratic State as well as a democratic Republic is the most dangerous attempt we have ever undertaken, and I urge my colleagues to look to the rule of law and to vote for our country's new leaders.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the dedication of Chairman Graham's district, including its most vulnerable members, with his opening speech with the Senator from Nevada and his opening speeches. This speech was the first-ever Senate business meeting to be held. It was the first meeting held of the Senator's staff.  Chairman Graham is well-known to the Senate, and I admire his work in our State for this important issue. In this Chamber, he is a true friend and a great leader for the Senate and for Nevada. Mr. Graham was a true friend of the Senate. He was a true partner in the Senate business and served as Chairman of the Budget Committee. He is a friend of the Nevada Senate delegation.  I thank Chairman Graham for his leadership on that and for his commitment and dedication to the Nevada Senate. This is the kind of leader we can all agree on. So I congratulate him on this great opening speech.
John Cornyn. Madam President, I think this is an excellent bill that would help my State and my country do better as a nation in dealing with the challenges facing us all in the wars against terrorism.  It would ensure that we have access to the best research on global climate change and our ability to manage and to use the technology that is necessary in trying to prevent the impacts of climate change and to protect Americans, families, and businesses from these potentially devastating fires and other natural disasters.  I just want to close by saying we need to stop the unnecessary wars, but we need to do the very best we can in trying to save lives.  We need to stop the attacks on families, businesses, and communities and, in many cases, our children, by shutting down one of the hottest areas in the world, because it can be deadly. And we need to do the very best we can in balancing our security, protecting Americans and protecting the safety of our kids and of our families.  I yield the floor to my friend the Majority and Minority leader who has introduced this bill, and I thank him and the Appropriations Committee for their tireless efforts in crafting this bill.  This is a bill I have introduced here in my State, and it would allow us
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I now read the remarks of Senator Collins regarding the bill. The Senator from Colorado has an interesting point that I want to make. In the Senate, the Senator from Colorado has more votes on the bill than any of us. Now, if I am not mistaken, the Senate is not counting for the Senate Members on the bill, and we don't even get to the point of passing the bill.  The one thing we are going to get to then is let the Senator from Colorado do it; let the Senator from Colorado do it. So let's pass it.  I have an amendment at the desk. I have an amendment at the desk that says we will vote on the bill. There are 13,000 Senators on the bill. So let's get to it.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate the leadership of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on the implementation of the National Highway System, the bill that is under consideration today. It is a bill that will provide essential funding for this Nation's aviation and other critical infrastructure.  The National Highway System was established in 1945 at the request of President Truman as the nation's first passenger transportation system, the National Highway System. As a result of its unique location at the foot of the Mississippi, it is the most effective transportation system in the world. In 1999, the National Highway System was officially approved by the U.S. House of Representatives, and in 2002 it became the first American transportation highway to officially be approved and implemented.  On April 2, 2002, the National Highway System was implemented to provide critical funding for the Nation's critical infrastructure. It contains the most comprehensive transportation system on Earth: the National Transportation Infrastructure. It supports over 6.5 million flights and over a million workers across the Nation.  This bill provides a critical transportation plan, including the National Highway System, for over a million and a half long-term passenger flights and over a million and a million workers between

We have already done this. We have done it, and we have done it, and we are not going to vote on it.  We will not vote on it and we do not support it, the Republican majority has done that. We have done it in a bipartisan way. We will not vote on it.  The amendment I offered and the Republicans now ask for its immediate consideration.  The bill passed by unanimous consent today includes two short-term tax cuts. They propose a 3.5 percent cut from the tax cuts before the budget deadline and an 8 percent cut after that. These cuts will result in an additional $600 billion for Medicare and $1.3 trillion for Social Security. The Republican bill is also included in the bill. These cuts will result in 2.5 percent unemployment benefits and an 11 percent reduction from the 2.5 percent tax cut.

If I may, I wish to thank Congressman Costa and my friend from Arizona. We are committed to working together to get this passed; I would like to give a brief description of how we are doing this and how we are moving towards a resolution.  I appreciate the work of Congressman Costa's and Congressman Mize's efforts and I am proud of them because we have the opportunity to work together to bring the bill to a vote.  In this bill, we will pass two amendments. To put it simply, the amendments will make absolutely no amendments.  To begin our work on the bill, we will move through the committee and we will move on to the reconciliation process to get that done,
Joseph Heck. I rise in opposition to the amendment. It would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to be a government-funded, non-Federal employee.  The law that is contained in this amendment simply says that the Secretary of Health and Human Services may have no authority to certify that a Federal employee has no legislative authority to waive its statutory mandate. It does not say that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is not authorized to certify that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has no authority to waive the statutory mandate to declare a public health emergency by issuing a certificate of emergency.  It is interesting to note that despite this amendment, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has no authority to certify another Federal employee, because that was the rationale for the current law. What is interesting about this amendment is that the underlying legislation is the only one that has been passed by Congress and is a law of the United States.  The underlying bill of the underlying legislation includes a provision, H.R. 3254 (the ``Statutory Calendar'       of Emergency), which makes clear the emergency mandate by the Secretary       of Health and Human Services that has expired and the Secretary of       Health and Human Services
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill that would authorize the Defense Department to provide and administer a waiver of Federal authority. This waiver would be provided by the Department of Defense. This process was delayed and delayed until it made available to Congress the mandatory authority to authorize the Secretary for fiscal year 2012 to administer a waiver program.  This amendment is not controversial; it is simply a way to get things done. This bill would authorize the Department of Defense, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Homeland Security, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and other agencies to provide and administer a waiver program to Congress. The bill would authorize the Department of Defense to administer this waiver program and for the first time in the history of the Department's history, Congress had a mandatory waiver. This waiver would be authorized by the Secretary of Defense, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs.  This bill would authorize the Secretary of Defense to administer a waiver program, which is a critical component of the Department of Defense's waiver program in the United States. This bill would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Indian Health Service, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs

Mr. President, I have more than 1,200 pages of the Senator from Kentucky's Record, a privileged collection of writings which have provided a wealth of insight into the issues facing Kentucky's post-war economy.  This is an extraordinary piece of work, and I wish to thank the Senator for her comments that I have just had time to read. I have just read a little bit of her piece, from one of the most prominent and most conservative thinkers of our time. She has had that experience as a young journalist, as an academic, as a young academic--she has, I am very certain, been an outspoken critic. And I don't think there is any question that she is a fine person to work with.  She has shown extraordinary leadership and integrity in her thinking and in her ideas, as both Senators and their colleagues have, and she was an inspiration and a champion of this issue--but she left a mark.  I want to talk a little bit about what I think people here in the Senate are thinking about. It just stands to reason we are going to end up with the deficit this week because we are going to have a deficit of some sort, a deficit of other things, and I don't think you can say
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, since my time in the Senate, I have been the author of several bills that have been debated and voted on by the people.

It is an honor for me, with the history of the Senator from North Carolina, to help him and me on the Senate floor during the debate of Senator Obama's health care bill. We just got to working with the Senator from North Carolina. I am going to tell you about the health care bill that we are debating now. So far, it has been an effort to help people who have health insurance if it is already in place to protect them from preexisting conditions. I will tell you, first of all, the idea of the health care bill, because it really is a political move and this is an attempt to push people to do this kind of policy that they do not need to do. This is a political move. It is a political move because, actually, as the senior Senator from the Conference of Presidents said, if the legislation has not been brought to the floor, it is not going to get brought to the floor. It is not an
Neil Abercrombie. So I can read the transcript here in this. So I'm not going to read it in that fashion. I believe this is a matter of debate. I believe this issue is going to be dealt with, and I think that is something that is very, very important to the American people and our country. If you look at our immigration policy, we have got an immigration issue that impacts every State in America. And if we look at the jobs being created, the wages being paid, the jobs being provided, so those are things that I think are going to be very critical in American life.  I think we're just beginning to work to address that in the next couple of months by the end of this Congress. So we can't wait to close the door on this issue.  One of the problems we face is, we know how to deal with it. So I've kind of looked at this legislation now.  One of the things that we've tried to address is we tried to start with a bill that's going to be in effect at the end of this year. And I think we've tried to work to create a strong, bipartisan effort that, hopefully, we could, in effect, create.  In other words

Joseph Heck. Madam President, we are here to discuss immigration reform, and we are here to debate immigration reform. I think it is important that we understand the issues before us.  The reason I am not here is because I think that if the President has had enough opportunities here, he will have gotten the opportunity to get all the things we have in the system. But, frankly, if Mr. White is going to get all the things we have in the system, I don't think he would get the opportunity to get to things that are not in the system. I want to talk about a couple of things about Mr. White. There is a lot of debate in the media when we talk about the things that we will be in in the coming months. But now that we hear that we will get to some of the things that are in the system, we're going to be able to take the steps that are being sought out and take to take our efforts to get to that level, both in the United States Senate and to get out of here and try to fix other, more complex things that are affecting our country.

Mitch McConnell. I thank the Senator for his comments on the floor. Madam President, what this is is an attempt to say that if you are really worried about the deficit, you can take a risk. To take a risk simply means to say that we can't take risk. And we are not willing to take risk, no matter how we think on the other side. That is what the majority's position seems to say.  It is not hard to understand why so many Americans are afraid that if they are going to turn to the other side and vote for the President, they will have to face the fact that they have the money and the ability to get the job done. This kind of a position that takes a risk is extremely important.  And it is very important that we try to fix this as soon as possible. I hope tomorrow we can do it tomorrow and say what we think, but we cannot, unless we have to get the job done.  This is a serious problem, and one that I hope we can solve sooner rather than later as we try to fix it. But I hope we can have a debate about it, and I am glad to take the time.

Since then, I have made several changes, but it is fair to say that I have now been away from the Capitol for more than 3 days.  I wish to thank the Senator from North Dakota for her participation.  The Senator from North Dakota is a well-known lawyer who is distinguished in his own State and his office. I want to say that I was struck by the absence of any opposition time or point of order. I will go through his amendment with the Senator from North Dakota, as they are talking about what they have done.  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.  
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, this week, we are going to hear an important moment from the Senator from Texas. Two weeks ago, Senator McConnell, after months of debate on the bill, and after I indicated the same to my colleagues, brought forth the bill. Now, there are a lot of issues in our country that we don't have time to debate before this weekend. The President is in a budget crisis going through this week. He is in a budget crisis. He is in a budget crisis. The President is going through a budget meltdown and the next budget is scheduled to be postponed. No matter who the President is at this moment, it is clear to me that the President will not put us back to work on that issue of keeping the economy going.  The American people do not have a choice. They choose to spend and get their health care insurance paid for. They choose to keep their money going.  The Republican budget will end. The Republican budget will end. The Republican budget will end.  For some, the best way to keep that revenue is to eliminate the deficit. The Democrat budget will end because the government doesn't give up. The Republican budget will end because the economy does not pay as much as we expect from the deficit
Neil Abercrombie. I wish to thank my friend from Maryland.  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8, the I-130 appropriations bill that is now before us. I am honored to be working with my fellow Members in the Judiciary Committee to support my amendment.  It is a good amendment. It is well, both for transparency and fairness. It is a good amendment. I am also very pleased that the Senate has been clear that we do not care about the lives of our citizens, the people of the United States, or those who live within our borders, and that we should support the I-130 legislation.  This bill is a good amendment, and we are working with my colleagues to provide transparency for families and communities across the country.  Mr. Chairman, I send my amendment to the Ways and Means Committee for its consideration.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk, having taken care of the amendment, e-mailed the a copy.  
Travis Childers. Madam Chair, H.R. 3238 is just today, but it is critical that we continue to work together and pass commonsense measures for both sides of the aisle to ensure that the bill is truly effective and that it is not a vehicle for corruption and abuse of power and corruption of the Senate.  The Rules Committee has already voted on a number of amendments that the Rules Committee and the Senate are considering to address corruption and abuse of power, including three of the most significant amendments I have seen on this bill.  One of the most significant amendments I have seen is a provision that will allow the United States House of Representatives to use the executive budget authority of the United States Senate to pay a ransom in an open and transparent manner. I applaud the House for making this provision, and I also applaud the United States Senate for allowing the Treasury and the President to use that authority when they don't like what's in the budget, which is a very important provision to ensure that our hardworking Americans are able to make smart and responsible decisions when it comes to their lives and their jobs.  This amendment would allow the Secretary of Defense to utilize the executive budget authority of the Senate to pay a ransom to help keep Americans safe. I would submit my

The Tiberightment will create a new bridge to access public transportation, which would make it possible for residents in my State to get to work. This new legislation would make it easier for transit systems that can only deliver a single vehicle to a certain point out of your State to serve your economy. It would make the transit system more efficient so that motorists would have access to transit without having to have to worry about their own transportation. This is a perfect solution for our city-stateside communities.  The Tiberightment is being reauthorized for three transportation needs: job, housing, and student financing.

The question is on the motion offered by the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cushing) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4437, as amended.  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and the bill was passed.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
Joseph Heck. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and service of the distinguished author of the ``Hanging in the Deep'' novel and author of the ``Sorrows'' novel, which was written in the memory of a dedicated, loving husband and wife who passed away last month at the age of 76. Her life and legacy will be deeply remembered.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to honor the life and service of the distinguished author of the ``Hanging in the Deep'' novel and author of the ``Sorrows'' novel. His novel was deeply emotional and bittersweet, and I am deeply honored that the novel is now in the possession of his loving family and friends.  I will share the story of a young mother who struggled through her financial struggles and chose to stay with her husband, a man whose life was about to unravel. Mr. Chairman, I have an important part to play in tonight's discussion of this story. We all know what it took: the financial meltdown and the challenges of economic stability. I would like to recognize the author of ``Sorrows'' and ``Hanging in the Deep'' who passed away late last month at the age of 76. Let me tell you about the author of ``Sorrow

I am very happy to be here today, especially because I want to thank Tom Cotton for his service, good work, and for his willingness to stand up and fight for our farmers.  The Senator from South Dakota, let me tell you that Tom has a lot of experience, an excellent resume, and he has a lot of good things to come up with. He is a true legislator. I appreciate Tom's character and the kind of character he has. I was a veteran, a strong warrior, and I will always strive to be a true legislator. But in doing a case such as this, Tom Cotton stands up and fights for the farmworkers.  I was away from the office last week, working with an intern who went into the farm business with his dad to do a project for a farm and he wanted to see it done. We got him out of the office, and he was doing a farm project and he told me, Mr. Chairman, that he wanted to see the project done.  It is really hard to make a difference. Most of us have a farm budget that is

Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank the chairman for taking a very professional look at what the health and education secretary should cover, and I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue.  I would like to thank our colleague, Congressman John Heinrich, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, as a friend, Congressman Heinrich made great strides in bringing together the health care reforms we want to do. His staff at the Health and Human Services Committee knows the importance of getting health care reform moving, and they know how important an important piece of legislation is to public health.  I would like to thank Representative Heinrich and Dr. Phil Pittenger for their leadership on this issue.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the Federal Government and what it means for America. This is a fascinating discussion, because there has been a great deal of debate on our Federal Government.  This is the first time I've been to Washington. We have a long standing debate and debate before us, and there is a lot of misunderstanding and a lot of debate about how we are really living and working. Our State and our country have been hijacked by Big Business, the new Republican President and his Democrats who are trying to distract us all from the American way of life and the way that everything is going.  We are not just talking about the State or the country; we are talking about how to spend what we have. The reality is that we don't give in; we give in to Big Business.  What this means, I think, is that this has been a lot about what we are all about: the way we are doing our job; the way the country is doing it; and the way we are living and governing, the way we are living because we are making progress.  I want to remind everybody, in this debate over the Federal Government, we are the country and we are the country.  Congress is not the
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, while we are debating our immigration bill, our immigration law is becoming outdated and outdated. A year ago, in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut and another year ago, the President of the United States of America announced his intention to designate his troop surge, a strategy that is working.  One of the things that happened, according to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Reform Affairs Committee, was that an immigration amendment that was rejected by the Senator from South Dakota had some bipartisan support from the people of South Dakota, who are very hard-right, not that of a Member of this Congress, but that of a Member of the Congress who I had to send to our district in order to help the President in addressing the national deficit.  The President then requested that we stop supporting these appropriations bills or any other immigration bill that is going to be going overseas.  I am hoping that this bill that was introduced by the President will pass this body because we all know that what happens at the border is very difficult to do. We know that it has a very narrow border.  So, I hope that the President will act

The Senate was scheduled to begin its consideration of this bill on September 20, 2019. The next motion of the President's motion to proceed to the S.

The Child Abuse and Neglect Prevention Act of 2009 contains the first priority for Congress and the Federal Government, as outlined in the Congressional Health Improvement Act of 2009. The Child Abuse Prevention Act includes a number of important provisions, which are intended to improve prevention, treatment, and the resources available to victims of domestic abuse. These include enhancements in prevention, treatment, and care tools, including prevention and monitoring.  It is my pleasure to congratulate Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton on this very important legislation.  I thank them for their hard work on this issue. I am pleased that this legislation extends critical resources for victims of domestic abuse throughout this country.  I am happy to say I have participated in the House Judiciary Committee to ensure that our Nation's child victims and victims of domestic abuse are safe, provided that there is sufficient funding for services and programs that support their recovery.  While there are some areas in which the Department of Homeland Security is providing resources to victims of domestic abuse, including the Safe Neighborhoods in Texas Project in Houston, the Violence Against Women Act is a bipartisan effort.

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a commonsense commonsense amendment.  I rise to defend the lawfulness of the proposed amendment.  The underlying legislation is called H.R. 2590, the Response to Unauthorized Adoption and Reentry Act. It is based on language that authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs to initiate and promulgate a program to help encourage a safe and responsible adoption procedure for children. The underlying legislation is also called the S.D.C. Program Act. The underlying legislation is called the Department of Veterans Affairs Sexual Assault Prevention and Treatment Service Act.  The underlying legislation was created in March 2009 and was put in place earlier this year, when Congress passed the Sexual Assault Prevention and Treatment Act, and it was subsequently reauthorized; the S.D.C. program was later put in place when Congress passed the S.D.C. Act, which was reauthorized in 2014, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Sexual Assault Prevention and Treatment Service Act was created later this year.

He can be very critical in making sure that we work together to secure our border.  I am concerned about the border security. It is not on our side of the border, and it is not a serious issue.  The border is a very important issue. It makes a big difference in a country we are a part of. Whether it is with the United States of America or with the United States of Pakistan, it is important. If we do not act now, we cannot act now. Our Border Patrol will be monitoring the people in our country who have no choice but to come forward and say that the U.S.-Pakistan border is safe. If we don't act now, we are in a situation where our Border Patrol will be in very dangerous situation that they are doing the job right.  As a former border worker, I will be very clear--and the Senator from New York will be clear by voice vote.  We all know that the American people are at risk, and, of course, we all understand that.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, H.R. 2525, which is the so-called ``Permanent Substitute for a War with Iran.'' And what is new in this bill is that the Secretary of State is now taking up Iran's request for a war with Iran.  The Department of Defense has been trying for 5 or 6 more years to expand the sanctions against Iran and then to create a war with Iran, and in many circumstances Iran has the right to continue to do so, even if the administration doesn't like it.  The Secretary of Defense is now using this request to fund a war with Iran in order to be used in a way that would allow Iran to continue to exercise its right to continue to fight over the U.S. war with Iran.  This provision, which was intended to create a war with Iran, is also a provision that allows Iran to continue to wage war with Iran.  But it is a war that Iran has in Iraq and Syria, and more than 3,000,000 American troops are stationed in Kuwait and Afghanistan.  The administration has used this provision to support the U.S. Government, yet, in all of the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, it is my privilege to speak today about a number of issues we all must work toward. So far, the first thing we are asking is to be able to have something the public believes to be a serious challenge to the United States and for our Nation. I am proud to be very clear that there is a lot of potential that can be explored when we put pressure on the United States to be more responsive to the needs of those countries in our region.  One of our current requests would be for the U.N. to ask the International Monetary Fund, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, what it would take to be an acceptable exchange rate for an exchange rate of 0.01 percent. And that is exactly what the people of the United States and of the world believe to be a serious challenge to this country, to our Nation, the world.  This is an issue that should be taken up very swiftly by us. If you are willing to look into a proposal that is acceptable to the United States, for instance, the U.N. should ask the U.N. the following: Do you think it will actually increase GDP?  Do you think it will actually increase the cost to the United States?  Can

I do so not out of concern that the State of Texas must suffer this ``unspeakable economic hardship,'' but to give our State a clear sense of what the pain of that has to do with our entire economy is, and how we would respond to that.  The Department of Justice told me last year that the pain--that the pain of the Department of Justice is that the pain has to do with what the State of Texas is doing but the pain has to be what the Department of Justice actually goes on behind closed doors and to put all of those who are involved with this whole effort together together, who are involved with what is going on behind closed doors, and that is what will certainly be one of the most difficult economic challenges of all time for our State of Texas. It is unfortunate that there can be that, as Representative Sessions said this year, there are a long list of people who are involved in the economic development of Texas and they know what's going on behind closed doors, and they know what's going on behind closed doors because of that and because I've been able to work with a lot of people who work in the Texas Chamber of Commerce and
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am on the floor here today talking about the health care bill that had been coming to Congress, the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, this legislation does not have the same basic health care reform that is necessary for all Americans. It also contains a large number of health care fraud claims which are used to justify the Federal Government's budget cuts.  The Republican Party has to be aware of this fraud in this bill and, indeed, that the Federal Government cannot afford to take it out of the law. This bill is unacceptable.

In the days and months following the 9-year anniversary of the Holocaust, it became clear that we were witnessing a growing effort to defend our democracy and freedom in a time of unprecedented authoritarianism, tyranny, and corruption.  Since the Holocaust, the United States and Israel have been fighting for freedom and democracy. At a time of increasingly oppressive governments and international crises, President George W. Bush made clear his determination to hold Israel accountable and to be a force for change in his life, a commitment to defend our freedom of thought, conscience, and ideas. But unlike most of the other nations, Israel has not been able to defend itself in a moment, nor has America. In fact, during the last several years of Obama's tenure, Israel has received more than 7,600 direct United Nations sanctions attacks. Israel continues to be a force for the change that is taking place, and it has received the most sanctions from the world.  In addition to destroying Israel, the United States continues to be involved in a conflict that has made Israel's standing, along with the world, far more precarious. President Obama, in light of the devastating attacks, asked Israel to

Travis Childers. You have a lot of questions. I was just speaking for this group and for the people. And all because we are trying to get to a place where we know this is not an easy situation for a lot of people. We got it done. It certainly did not happen overnight. It made a difference. We have more people in the service area, in the private sector, who are frustrated with this bill. One of the things this is, I think, the most profound thing that happens in this country is that you know it's coming. People come to work, there are more jobs created. People come and pay taxes. It is not done. And, really, it is not done. It is very hard to get into the process. But I think the Congress should be listening to what the majority says. And we shouldn't just pass this bill, but we should make these difficult decisions. We should get more people in the service, more people in the private sector, more people in the public, and more people in this country who need this, which is the American Way and that it is a good idea to move our country around. The American Way, which is the American way of life, is at its core a good idea

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from New Mexico for yielding me the opportunity to represent New Mexico.  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his leadership on this resolution that is going to end this year. So I think he is right. This resolution was written by a gentleman from New Mexico. It was written a few minutes ago by a gentleman from the State of Oregon and was signed by two Senators. It is a very important thing. It provides opportunities to make sure that we do not get into the same business. I want to thank them for the efforts on behalf of the American States of America about the critical need for us to improve accountability and accountability for our States and, in particular, all of the States in the State of New Mexico.  In a year that has been coming, this resolution will pass the Senate. We will now set the goals and start moving forward. It will be a very important measure. It will be a very, very important step forward to provide for our State and for the U.S. economy, the entire economy, and to bring about an economic recovery that will not stop, and I think it is important that we do this right now in Congress.  My
Richard Durbin. Madam President, on I-75, a new bill was introduced on which a lot of time has been wasted on this bill. This is the subject of a major debate on the floor today because it is the bill that passed the Judiciary Committee in the Senate. It is not the subject of a debate on the floor that the Judiciary Committee was unable to vote on today. The bill, I believe, is the bill that would allow the States to get rid of our nuclear deterrent programs. This bill would allow State regulators to be able to get rid of these nuclear deterrent programs if they do not want to allow the nuclear deterrent programs to be deployed to protect their citizens.  The U.S. Department of State has done a very good job regarding the security and security of the Nation. There have been several bills that I have introduced on this bill that have been in the public domain. It does not mean that all of us do not have a great deal of expertise on this aspect of nuclear security or on the security and security of our Nation's water resources.  Again, if we are going to keep our country safer, we must do it together. We have got to keep it safe. We have got to keep it safe. We have got
Neil Abercrombie. The gentleman from Florida is an expert on the economic issues facing our Nation, the most critical issues facing our Nation.  Madam Chair, I have to say that I think it is very important for this House to do very, very, very well, in a bipartisan Congress.  There is a lot of economic growth being built in this country that have been built on behalf of all of the American families.  I think it is just not enough for Members of Congress to vote on this very important thing that they should do. I think it really is a very important thing for the American people of all ages, and we need to do a very, very thoughtful and bipartisan vote as we move through this year.  I would encourage my colleagues to vote for this legislation.  And if I had to pick one of them, I would pick the one in my hand that I think is right for the purpose of making this bipartisan vote.  Let's help the American people and the American people across this Nation work together.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas be recognized as the author of the amendment.  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.  The ayes prevailed.
Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, let me yield myself the remainder of my time.  The bill in the House is no longer just a bill. It is now all that is left in the Republican playbook. It is not just the Republican playbook. Let me just mention one thing. I have heard good things about this bill, even a couple of days after it was signed by the U.S. House of Representatives. I recall going through the House Committee on Finance. We had a couple of good things going on with the Senate, including the fact that, like every other country, the U.S. House of Representatives did not even have a vote on these bills. I do not know what the Senate Republicans are thinking. But I believe it is something that this bill has done in a way that is not the same thing as anything else we do. The President and President Clinton in the House of Representatives didn't even have a vote on this bill. This is the opposite of what a person of our time would think.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.  The question is on the motion to recommit.  The SPEAKER pro

Harry Reid. Mr. President, we are here today to welcome the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Durbin), the leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to Capitol Hill for their historic evening of legislation and bipartisan support.  Today is something special to us. It was in the last Congress of the two Presidential administrations. It was a year that saw the first Presidential election. It was a moment when we had the first debate on healthcare. It was a moment when we had the first debate on healthcare.  Our country's health care system is deeply flawed and that is why it is particularly important to bring the Senate back to our country. In the Senate, we have a Senate that is much closer to the American public than anybody in our country. We have a Senate where we can make a lot of good investments and invest and create jobs. At the same time, we have a Senate that is in an even bigger crisis than we have in here.  Our Nation faces significant economic challenges. We know that job losses are widespread and that the economy is at a very good place. We know that jobs are growing and that the economic situation in America is at a critical turning point. Our economy is going through a very tough recession that is hurting our confidence in our democracy
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. We know we need to do more for jobs, and that's why we're introducing legislation today, in the Senate. We can do a lot of good work for what's right and what's wrong. And I think that's important.  I am proud of the work that's done here. I thank Chairman Pallone for his hard work.

He is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  He is someone well acquainted with the issues at stake here, someone who, if I could just say how much I appreciated his energy and his commitment. It is a great honor to thank him for all those hours that he has given to us as the executive branch and the entire Senate. I certainly appreciate it.  I want to first say that I am not happy that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee has chosen a bad precedent, a bad example. It isn't so bad, but the majority leader has made a bad precedent. I think we may now be a good institution to be part of, and I also want to acknowledge the fact that he has presided over the most consequential of our constitutional amendments and those amendments that we will ever consider.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, we are very pleased to see the United States Senators on this legislation today in the debate and pass it.  Well, there is a lot of good news coming out of Washington. We have the largest troop number in Afghanistan--with over 2,000 servicemembers--and they have done much to help us. We have spent a lot of time working with the Afghan police in the aftermath of the earthquake and we have heard from them. We are doing a phenomenal job in the country. There is a lot of interest among the State Department and Federal prosecutors. We are doing a tremendous job. We are doing great. We are committed to making money. I don't think anybody expected us to pass this legislation this year. It is time to do more money and we are trying to do more.  Last year the Senate passed a bill that would allow the State Department to develop new training programs and hire more military personnel. That is about making sure we do this. We have a $1.4 billion bill that we are working on. We are working on several programs that are going on with us.  The question we are asked--or do you think are we going to pass? Of course--is the question to the

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3350 and urge my colleagues to oppose this measure because it conflicts with the mission of the National Park Service.  The NPDES Act reflects Congress's commitment to protecting the historic and national importance of this magnificent National Park, and the NPDES Act is particularly appropriate for the long-term planning and the long-term support of the Park Service for its historic and economic expansion.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3350 is based on the principle that the NSN should serve as an agency, not a police force. It is the intent of the Congress to protect the National Park Service's important role, and it is a principle of the Nation's service that the NPDES act should not be interpreted by our States by the law.  Our State and local law is well-established in the National Park Service, and while the law does not apply to the Park Service, it has always been a fundamental principle of the National Park Service to operate the Park Service as the agency of the National Park Service, not as a police force.  That is why we need a National Park Service agency to protect the physical, cultural, and economic diversity at this important National

She is currently the president and CEO of the San Diego Public Schools.  I would like to talk briefly about my personal connection to the issue.  What can I do to help my wife?  I do not think that it is my best career approach.  Madam Chair, my best career experience is with the education of the women's basketball program. They have the lowest college graduation rate in the country and go on 3-year academic probation at 6 years of age. A woman who works at a large, well-equipped, high-tech college in San Diego is getting married and living his life. This is what I mean: the business and the education of the women's basketball program.  I know what it is like. I mean it is a school-level experience.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, when President Obama spoke about the need for more troops to fight the Islamic State, he used that speech in part on the economic front and the threat it poses to our Nation. He said that the U.S. military forces in Iraq could face no more: no more terrorists, none. Yet they had to pass their weapons to war. He told us: ``If we don't act now and act now, we won't be in war again.'' Now he said: ``The only thing you need is a smart country, a world that gives that country the stability of its own destiny.''  That was the speech.  So what happened? Well, to this day, President Obama has been absolutely unequivocal that he never would have said that in my State of Oklahoma. He was absolutely unequivocal that President Obama never would have put his troops in Iraq. And he said: ``No more terrorists.''  But President Obama didn't just say: ``That means no more terrorists.''  And then he brought in the terrorists. He said: ``Now that is wrong,'' and he said: ``When we give your troops a lesson, it is time to change things.''       We're talking about how much
Richard Durbin. I would say that we need to be really careful about the use of our money. There is an awful lot of that going on around here. I want to be very clear about that. If we are going to expand the Federal Government, we understand, we want to be spending too much that we are holding to go on. This is very clear to me as a citizen of my State who is concerned that we are going to grow and we will expand to do that.  I am prepared to work with my colleagues for a better understanding of what was going on. If we want to expand for example, if we are going to do it on a bipartisan basis, if we want to be better able to do that, I am prepared to do that.  I think I said it in that passage. I have to say that I appreciate the gentleman's strong leadership, and I think we all appreciate his leadership. But we will need to work really hard to get to the bottom of that.  I would say that this is an excellent opportunity to go into it. We have some great issues that we need to address. I think an example of that would be to put together a plan that would put in place the following: we are going to

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I was very disappointed to hear that Senator Hatch' s amendment to the Trade Improvement Act of 2009 would cause the U.K.'s economy to default on its obligations under the Endangered Species Act. So as a former legislator, that legislation simply wasn't appropriate.  We have to end all of this on the front page of here. We should all be asking the same thing.  I understand there are two different versions of this bill in the committee. One, which I believe this amendment to the Trade Improvement Act requires, is to protect American jobs. A lot of our colleagues have said that we have to fix the economy and the economy must grow and that is the most important thing we can do, to help our economy. That is the thing that works for the American economy and the American job market.  I urge my colleagues, and I also urge my colleagues who are concerned with the deficit, to pass this amendment.  So I am going to join with my colleagues on the House and the Senate on passing an amendment. I want to thank my good friend, Senator Hatch, for her work on this bill and her bipartisan support. That is the only amendment we have left to the committee here today to ensure our economy
Joseph Heck. Madam President, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  I rise in strong support of Medicare. That health care is not enough.  I rise in strong support of the President's executive action, the so-called emergency plan, as I call it, Medicare, which is one of the most important health plans in the United States, which is the one that is more than half a century old.  This is an opportunity for Americans to come together to find common ground, to come together to move forward and to try to lower the cost of health care that we have and take action.  I commend the chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works for their work on this, and I thank them for their efforts.  While I am not opposed to the Emergency Plan, I do not believe it is appropriate for our insurance industry to act as if there is no health care and that there is no health care available.  My point is that if we do deal with the uncertainty, the uncertainty that insurance companies have given health care to consumers, that insurance companies can't be responsible in providing care. My point is that if there are concerns that the insurance companies are going to provide healthcare, it is the insurance companies who are

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I wish to take up the two-part question.  We have been asked to answer by a lot of Americans who have been on the edge of their seats--not in this Congress but in this board of leaders. There are, I think, 50,000 people on the board of leaders waiting to be voted on how to vote on whether to do business with a foreign country, whether to buy American products, whether to work with the U.S. Government in a cooperative effort, whether to allow foreign companies to enter into our contracts, whether to make our products available on the Web.  And for the American people, when we say let's be open, let's be open and open and let's put American businesses in the game. Let's get a company into the game whether it is America or Canada--let's do our business in Canada, export what we have, make the U.S. currency, and then let's do it in America through all our good and bad contracting contracts.  There's another option, Mr. President, which is to build the infrastructure of our Nation. We are going to build a new Nation, and that is going to be an economic and political game.  The Nation is

Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  While not the first time that I have had to work against this bill, I will continue to work on it.  If you have a question about the law that is put forth by our friends on the other side of the aisle, you will not find it on the floor today. There is no question that this bill is very, very important to me, and I look forward to having it passed.  I think it should have been cleared that way. As we go ahead of time, though, things have gone pretty mad about this bill that I hope we all will continue to fight on.  I yield back the balance of my time.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I wish to continue to close by mentioning that this year I introduced a bill, the ``Vacation Expansion and Inclusion Act,'' to allow the Secretary of the Interior to begin consultation with Native American tribes, and other stakeholders, on the development of the Biodiesel Project to explore the potential of coal-burning fuel, which has been used for many thousands of years for energy needs.  The bill has two important recommendations. One is the following: For every 100 Americans who live in buildings and use coal-burning fuel, the amount of gas required to power them must provide at least one kilowatt hour of electricity. In addition, the Biodiesel Project will expand the use of natural gas. It will also develop more environmentally friendly energy options for the Nation's most environmentally friendly energy sources.  Second, there is a bipartisan bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to expand the scope of the Biodiesel Project. This bill will allow the Secretary of the Interior to expand this project to include oil and gas exploration, in addition to energy, and new technologies. The United States has now invested in oil exploration and development, but this project will be a good investment for the Nation. The Biodiesel Project would also
Neil Abercrombie. Again, if you look at the recent chart in here, it is a sign, I presume, that we are in a period that is coming to a conclusion.  I just want to make sure that the fact of the matter is that the Republican tax cuts came to fruition as a result of our current tax rules. That is a sign, by the way, that the fact of the matter is that the Republican tax cuts came to fruition as a result of our political philosophies and our economic policies. And the reason is we are going to have to look back at the entire year and years and years of Republican policies and the Republican policies and the Republican policies that are not the basis for the Republican tax cuts.  So you are hearing what these Republicans said, I think they are right. They seem to be right, I think, back in 2007. They said, Well, what the Republicans said, let's do something like that.  We have heard some of our Republican colleagues are right this year, and we have heard them say, Well, we don't have a tax relief on this and we are saying we are going to have a tax relief for 20 or 30 years, so we want to do something that can help people in all
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Smith).  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute each and every one of us who serve our country, our families, and our community, and my colleagues, my colleagues from Wisconsin, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Texas.  I rise to honor a veteran whose legacy and dedication to service will be forever intertwined in the fabric of our Nation's service today.  On July 28, 2016, President Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, honoring and honoring a veteran who served America. This is a significant milestone for the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families.  This milestone is especially meaningful in light of the fact that every member of our military family and the communities they serve are the greatest. For this reason, I think it is fitting that the Department of Defense budget for fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2030 is this year's appropriations.  Although our Nation is one of the greatest for its brave men and women, the veterans I serve need not fear the costs associated with service. This is all about taking care of our veterans and their families.  Each and every military family has a voice and a spirit of service, and today, I am proud to
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, following are words from the House of Representatives that President Obama has spoken several times in support of the amendment.  These words should be a reminder of the deep concern that families who have been torn apart on Wall Street are still suffering. A strong response by the White House, to the recent $14 trillion stimulus package, would provide that strong relief and confidence that the families on Wall Street, as they have been left by their American brothers and sisters, would be protected by a strong American public debt limit.  I urge all Americans to support this important measure.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I wish to honor a lifetime of service to America and its people, and wish to extend my appreciation to our Nation at large for providing leadership and an exceptional foundation for our Nation's future.  I am not a native of the United States of America, but I am a native of the State of Texas--the State of Texas.  I am also fortunate to be a member of the National Guard, a veteran of the United States Army, and an active-duty Army Air Forces veteran, and I am a member of our National Guard Air Training Center.  I am very proud of my service as the first African-American marine on the National Guard and Honor Guard, and I am very proud that I chose the opportunity that my parents and I have done for them.  I am grateful and wish my life to be a part of that mission. 
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I want to make one final point that I reserve the balance of my time. We are having, apparently, the most tragic and difficult time in our caucus. The House of Representatives has to decide in which area the Federal Government decides. As I said earlier, I think we are in the wrong year. We can't afford to be out of step with the Federal Government. We can't afford to be out of touch with Washington. We can't afford to have our elected representatives on the floor and the House of Representatives in one place, yet when they get together and come together they are going to try to figure out a way to reduce the debt problem.  I believe the House of Representatives has to be prepared to deal with this.  The truth is that it is going to be a long day.  At the end of the session, the House will pass a resolution. We know that the Senate has passed a bill, and they are going to have a chance to hear it. This is going to happen. We are waiting to vote. We are waiting to hear what Congress has to do to help put together the necessary appropriations bills to deal with the looming debt crisis that is affecting all of us.  I am hopeful
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. President, as long-time chairman of this body, I rise to bring the Senate to its knees. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I have always wanted to take care of our country's interests with the most appropriate measures. As I listened to my colleagues, we are not going to pass the most expensive sanctions that we can find, but we are at least going to pass the most comprehensive economic sanctions, which is going to cost billions.  Let's not let the President of the United States take us into the worst nightmare that we know as a nation. Instead, this body has been given the opportunity to pass a bill that is a little too expensive, but that has been put before us on a bipartisan basis.  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in cosponsoring the most appropriate sanctions that we can find at this time.  No Member of the Senate can be more than a little confused by the fact that our friends have not been afforded a great deal of the information in the intelligence community. The information is wrong. These are the facts of the matter.  In this country, the greatest intelligence gathering unit in history is located in a high-tech field in Moscow. For the first time since the
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my comments, and let me just mention that I am well aware of all of the other issues that are going on behind us in this Chamber and I find this one particularly troubling. I am particularly troubled as to why some of the gentleman from Texas and gentleman from Texas Members are being detained in order to be sent to the other side.  A little while ago, I was with my colleague, Senator Burr, who is a strong advocate for the Federal Government to keep us safe. He and I were talking for a minute. He said that he would like to be allowed to speak just for the purpose of debate.  I was on the floor today, as I was, when he was asked if he was going to be detained. Not only was it about the other issues. I was on the floor and he was asking me whether I could bring an amendment to that amendment, and I was in that exact position. So if that amendment were to be brought, I would be glad.  I think, at this time, I believe the gentleman from Texas has made very clear that he is in a position to have a strong sense of urgency in the minds of the American people about all issues.  I yield back the balance of
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to the gentleman from California, Mr. Thompson, from the chair of our committee, the majority leader from New York, Mr. Nadler, and ranking member of the committee, Mr. Shaheen, from the distinguished Foreign Affairs Committee.  Mr. Speaker, in a letter to our distinguished colleague from California, Mr. Thompson, I want to thank him for the work he has done for over a decade, the work that has been put into this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I ask the House to extend 1-year-long support for the amendment offered by Mr. Harkin, who is well-known for his commitment to the hard-working people of this country.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, this is a remarkable opportunity. It is a privilege to be here today. Just as President Obama was prepared to make his visit and to take up the theme of the hour, the same opportunity to visit the Capitol with his friends, the Republicans, in concert with the American people, will be on offer.  This opportunity is a perfect opportunity to serve our friends, our families, the American people--some of us are certainly friends of the President of the United States.  We have had a great opportunity to see the President of the United States firsthand. I know the first thing that comes to mind is that when he sees in his mind some of the most important issues--the President of the United States, the President of the United States, the country, even the Nation--our friends and the American people, the people that they are supporting, the American people believe, that one of their greatest, the greatest, the greatest moment, the greatest opportunity, is given right now by his wife. And we have all been, quite frankly, a little bit touched by his heart.  And my wish is to give this opportunity to every American citizen, so that the American people, and those of us, will know that we have the

As the chairman of the Budget Committee, I am fortunate to have a good friend who is an expert on this issue, Senator Alexander, who has been a leading voice in this matter for some time. I was a committee member on both sides of this particular issue in the previous Congress. While I have been very involved, I have been very involved with this bill from the beginning. I would like to take a moment to thank the chairman for his leadership and for his hard work on this topic, and I would also like to thank the hardworking staff of the Budget Committee for their tireless efforts to provide needed funding to us, to the Defense Department, and for their hard work on this issue.  I stand in strong support of this bill because it is so important that we get to know our enemies, and we need to know their ways. It is important that they don't hide behind the walls of a defense room. That is why I am sponsoring a bill to strengthen and protect our military. I commend members of the Armed Services Committee for their leadership on this issue.

Thank you to the Senator from Minnesota for offering--in my home State, Wisconsin--a voice and encouragement to all folks on this border.  I will continue to support our State's efforts, and I will continue to support the progress that we are making. But I want to thank my friend, Mr. Ryan, for all of his efforts. He has worked hard in the last few years to bring us this important bill, and he has helped us to move this forward. His advocacy has been very instrumental. I admire his commitment to public service. We will continue to support our State's immigration policy if it is implemented.  I just want to thank my friend Senator Mikulski and Senator Blumenthal for their work on this. They have been really helpful. I appreciate them. The bill also included provisions to ensure that all children are given the appropriate legal status and that we keep children safe. That is the focus of this bill, and I want to commend them for their hard work. That is what I would like to see them continue to have for their families and for our State, especially with this bill.  I yield to the Senator
Neil Abercrombie. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I appreciate your support of this legislation.  I am pleased and honored to see this legislation passed, and I thank you for that.  As you know, on May 1, 2011, the House of Representatives, under the law on which this bipartisan bill was passed, approved, and passed by unanimous consent and through the Senate, was able to reauthorize the law for the first time.  We recognize that we do have some differences in the House and the Senate on this subject, but both the House and the Senate are unanimous on this. When we voted on this the House passed the legislation, and it was the only one that had adopted the bill and that passed by a vote margin of 89.6 per cent. So I am happy to see that, as we move forward in the years ahead, and that is the first vote on this bill.  Under the law on which this legislation was passed, I am pleased to see that they passed both at the same time.  I thank Chairman Waxman for his leadership and the support to get it done. It is important that I do that to encourage others to pass these bills. I thank you and all of you for helping us work through

After a very long day in which I had hoped to do the Senate business, I am now wondering why Republicans on the other side of the aisle think I should be talking about the $500 billion that could be appropriated for infrastructure. I think it is clear to me that this fiscal year funding will create a long way for it to do its job, and that we will need the same kind of funding that will bring the money it needs to the Federal Government.  In the months that this budget is over, the only way I can find out the names of the major projects the government can spend on infrastructure is to ask them: What are the numbers you think they need to spend on infrastructure and how do you give them the money that they have to build, to provide for the infrastructure? How much money are they going to spend? How do they know how much money each one has to spend? How much money are they going to spend?  I have never met someone who asked, ``What are the numbers?'' I know of only one. This isn't just the fact that their name has been changed, I know of only one. But I think it is time to ask the taxpayers to pay

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 100-year-old founder of the Federal Land, the Land Grant Program, and to honor his life and legacy as the original landholder of the country.  Since 1983, the Land Grant program has provided grants to hundreds of Federal wildlife refuges that are needed to support wildlife research in our communities around the country. Over 80 acres of approximately 1,800 acres and hundreds of thousands of acres of habitat are in the Land Grant Program. I am proud to recognize the Land Grants Program, which was started in 1973, and which is now held under the Antiquities Act, and which has been funded by the National Park Service under this legislation.  I have long enjoyed the opportunity of the Land Grants Program, which helps to provide funds to small to high value refuges and to many State and local grants to sustain them. However, the funds that have been appropriated to do the work of the Land Grants Program have not been fully utilized, and I am grateful, as well, for the continued diligence of the Land Grants Program.  I am pleased to have worked with the managers of the Land Grants Program, and I look forward to continuing to support this program.  For the last

He is still alive, and he is the longest serving member of the Republican leadership, a true friend, and a true colleague.  Mr. Speaker, this week's roll call vote from the House will also allow me to express my condolences in mourning for the loss of someone who will live to regret over this most difficult and painful day. I mourn the loss of John T. Duffy, a 21-year-old intern in our district in rural New Jersey, who was killed in Tucson, Arizona, last September 9 days ago, while trying to navigate a maze of dangerous, overcrowded facilities.  I mourn the loss of the former colleague who has lived alongside him and who will miss him greatly. He will be missed very much. His family will miss him. He is beloved and beloved, and I love him.  Mr. Speaker, we have lost a great and beloved friend. We have lost a wonderful colleague. I would like to thank him and his family for their support of our Nation's veterans, and I can't believe what they have done.
Travis Childers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your question and for all the great work you did.  I would just say again that this isn't just about you--the gentleman's and the Congressional delegation--but to the people there, and to the people around the Nation.  It is about our children.  I think we all agree we ought to stand up for them. It is about the people who have the responsibility to make sure we know the facts and are responsible.  Let's be honest with each other as to whose fault this bill is. Let's be honest with the people who are concerned about the safety of our children. Let's be honest with the people who are concerned about their safety. But that is why it is important to keep the government accountable.  So would you yield to my good friend from Iowa?  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote on a resolution that will rein in our debt, which our hardworking Americans have become taxed over the past 10 years.  Let's not repeat what we already know so we can keep our people debt-free. I am going to be one of 3 Republicans to vote against that resolution. So let's vote together. Let's not repeat what was already spoken for, but let's keep the promise of the health care reform that is going to be a reality for the next 2 years.  Let's keep unemployment rising because we are stuck in a cycle we are going to lose a lot of us here in this Congress to borrow every time our President tries to borrow $5.3 trillion or more. I want to talk about the debt that I think is currently at $3.2 trillion so all this discussion about debt is going on at the same time.  This is a serious issue because you have to get used to the idea of borrowing. You have to pay your taxes, you have to earn income and get a job, it is a huge responsibility that these people have to get into those loans. We have to learn that the money we borrow is going to support our children
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, as the Republican leader knows, it is the Democrats trying to get people to pay taxes on the rich.  It is not an easy task, to be honest with you. But you can achieve those victories.  I would like to ask my colleagues in the Finance Committee, when the legislation is coming up, to please explain to us some of the problems that are encountered when trying to get people to pay tax on their income. We will address them when we come up for debate, in the committee, today and on the floor of this House.  And in the process, I hope we have a good understanding about how we balance the budget.  I would really like to thank my good friend with the greatest mind on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, and the Finance Committee for their dedication to bringing this legislation forward so it is here and so that all Americans can have a wonderful, happy life.  As you can see, some of these issues are not being addressed. But if we do some meaningful work in this regard in a bipartisan way, I urge support of the bill, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for her outstanding leadership on this issue.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, we rise today to honor the life, legacy, and legacy of Dr. George A. B. Whitehouse. Dr. Whitehouse was a renowned physician in my hometown of Lewisburg, Illinois, where he passed away recently of complications of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.  Dr. Whitehouse was a leader in the fight to make sure that our health and our health care system was preserved and our financial health system was protected.  As president of the National Community Health Association, Dr. Whitehouse was instrumental in making the National Community Health Center a true community health center that I believe was essential to our Nation.  The National Community Health Center is the largest, most comprehensive, and highly effective community health center in the Nation. It was named after Dr. Whitehouse, who founded the National Community Health Center in 1892 in my hometown of Lewisburg. This historic center is an important part of our national security and our Nation's prosperity.  In the year of his passing, Dr. Whitehouse spent his entire career working for the National Community Health Center in Lewisburg. It was a great honor for him to be part of the group that brought his name to life and to become the leader and first chairman of the National Community
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator Brown and Senator Reid for their efforts in passing the bill.  In 2014, Mr. Brown, a State senator from Texas, fought to help our communities by providing affordable healthcare and public education and training. On April 30, 2014, Ms. Pascrell received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Youth Council.  The Lifetime Achievement Award recognizes the highest distinction in the life of a young person. The success of the Lifetime Achievement Award is reflected in every State in every area, and we have every State in every year.  A true young person deserves the recognition and support of parents and caregivers to put their children in good health. This recognition is a strong foundation for all Americans to be able to care for themselves and others who live in this country.  The Lifetime Achievement Award recognizes the American public who are able to contribute to the American way of life by contributing to healthcare and education.  Mr. Boxer's contribution to the National Youth Council is an example of the dedication that we all strive to do--to take care of people who live in need and who need them most within the very meaning and importance of their lives.  Through his leadership and support, Mr. Boxer has helped thousands of

Mr. Speaker, the House will do whatever it takes to protect the citizens of this great country, but we cannot continue to do it without addressing the underlying issues we face every day. Our economy is facing another economic crisis that will never end, and our Nation's future is in danger. Our military is preparing a devastating military invasion.  Our seniors need help, but they need to be protected from potential future dangers.  Today it is time to pass the Energy for Choice Act.  In response, I am introducing this bill to ensure that the House and Senate has the resources necessary to meet the needs of the 21st century.  This is a bipartisan bill that provides funding for the Energy and Space Agency and other programs funded by the Department of Defense. To that end, we have the authority to fund a continuing education program for low-income teachers, children, and senior citizens throughout the country.  The Energy for Choice Act is a $1.6 billion investment aimed at protecting our citizens from future threats. The bill seeks to give all of the funding to the Energy and Space Agency to support two-
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, this time we must use the time in the House to do something significant, but not a year, not a full year, but an hour each. We have a long and proud President.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, today we recognize, along with the country's senior executive director, Mr. Peter L. Rummel, Jr., the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Postal Service that begins with the start of the postal business, the postal industry.  Mr. Rummel, a postal technician from New York, is the proud head of the postal industry. Over the years, he has worked tirelessly on behalf of the Postal Service. He was in the U.S. Postal Service when the Postal Service began. He began his career and eventually became a dedicated postal technician.  Mr. Rummel is a member of the National Association of Postal Service Executives. Since 1993, he has been the postman at the U.S. Postal Service. He is well known as a consummate professional and has spent much of his career dealing with the Postal Service's needs.  Mr. Rummel had a long career in the postal trades and as a part-time employee, he had access to the mail for over 50 years. He has spent over 50 years repairing, installing, and cleaning the mail machine to keep the postal system within its current status, to ensure delivery times are acceptable.

If the Russians, as the President has said, do not give them the money back again, is it true that they are going to give us back the hostages back to us?

I would like to thank all the staff in our office, the leadership staff, the people on the floor of the House, and the President and especially the President for the job that they have done and I thank you for the job you have done.

This amendment is simple, straightforward, and will save taxpayers $10 billion and provide a more transparent and accountable process for health care decisions.  Americans should know that we have a very important moral duty to provide health care for all, regardless of where the illness or damage it will affect, regardless of what the doctor is doing.  The American College of Physicians is a profession of honesty and integrity.  Americans should not see that our role is to give credit to the American College of Physicians, and that is not a mistake. Instead, the American College of Physicians is protecting our rights with a straightforward, straightforward process.  Let's take the opportunity to help make sure the American College of Physicians understands the reality of how we are dealing with the American health care

I also have many questions that I have for my colleagues. I am concerned that by taking this important step, Congress won't be taking more effective steps to address the problem. I am concerned that the Attorney General might choose not to follow his predecessor's advice. We all recognize that.

I have come to the floor, my good friend from Texas, and this is what Senator Byrd brought to the floor.

We know we have the right to debate at the U.S. Senate; but we know as a nation that it is not a free country. We know we can debate and debate and debate, in the most basic form, without having to go abroad.  I was a freshman member of the committee before joining this body, and I remember reading the bill before it passed. That bill would have made sure that we could have a fair debate without having to give up their right to vote in the Senate, and I think this bill was a good idea.  I am proud to say that this is a bill that has worked. It worked before and it had a good effect on the government. And, I think it is very well documented that it has worked; that the bill has been passed by a very good vote, and I think it has been a very good bill.  If we look at the bill before this bill that we are passing is about the border, we are passing this very important piece of legislation. It is not a bill that is intended to do anything, but it is about trying to move forward and we are doing a great deal.

As a leader who understands a number of issues, Ms. Loeffler has helped to craft a strategy to move our Nation forward. She understands a variety of issues impacting our energy, including many that come from many different perspectives.  I wish to call attention to one such issue that was raised by her own staff.  Mr. Speaker, this is not an isolated incident. Ms. Loeffler was charged with being an extremist, and that charge has been thoroughly debunked. That charge was charged against Ms. Loeffler, who was named the lead on the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House.

I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2794, our Nation's Children's Health Risk Availability Act.  This important piece of legislation, the Children's Health Risk Availability Act, is the largest Federal health insurance fraud bill in the country. It is especially important in my State of South Carolina for young people to have access to affordable and quality insurance for their children.  Last month, I traveled to the United States to join this bipartisan bill to help provide the best coverage for our children and to provide a good opportunity for their parents to have access to affordable health insurance.  I have been encouraged by what I learned from this example. It is in my mind when I think of the child from Illinois and my daughter from South Carolina, who have all suffered financially from this attack.  The bill also includes reforms that I will be introducing next year, including one simple amendment, a critical safety net that will ensure children with early stage injuries and children at risk of autism can have a safe, affordable private medical insurance provider.

So how can we do a good job on this issue because we don't want to do a bad job doing what we can to help this country, to help our children and our kids, to help our people and our country, but we don't want to do a bad job at all saying that we, in the process, will do better on our own.  So I think the only real question is, what does the American people want?  I ask my colleagues, when do we ask the American people?  Do we want to do better, or are we going to do better by moving the country forward on this issue?  Will we want people to be able to talk about it or will we want people to be able to go through some other kind of process?  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 738, the National Response Fund Act. This will create an additional $6.4 billion in new Federal and State programs for the 21st century. We already have more than 2 million new jobs that are created in our State. The National Response Fund is the largest State job-killing funds that were created in the last 10 years and the largest in the last 3 years of the last century.  With the national response fund, we will see new jobs generated which will lead to more economic growth. There will be more jobs created here in the country. There will be more people working in our Federal, State, and local economies. There will be an increased workforce in our country.  Over 50 percent of the country's manufacturing jobs will come from our National Response Fund. This is a huge opportunity.  Today's votes in the Senate will allow us to achieve a bipartisan, positive change in economic policy to address the challenges that are facing our country's economy.

And I think that, finally, is what we were going to accomplish in the Affordable Care Act.  This bill helps us get a stronger, more affordable alternative to the government, a more affordable market. This bill helps to get a market for people into coverage. This bill has actually made some progress in reducing the burden of health care costs on people and improving choices.  My good friend from Colorado has given us the leadership, the leadership, the leadership leadership. He is the chairman of the Finance Committee. It is very important that we do everything we can to make sure people have access to affordable health care and a better choice to get there. I thank him for his leadership and the leadership he has, and I think we can accomplish
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We are in a recession, we face the threat of job losses, and unemployment is on the rise.  The Department of Labor is looking at a very clear signal from which we must act. It has called for emergency relief and to provide more certainty and predictability into our job market.  The Department has been operating with a mission that has taken care of the economy and the economy at an extraordinarily low cost. But as my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pointed out, the unemployment rate at the end of the week that is expected to be 8.1 percent, 2.5 percent, 5 percent, 7.5 percent, 8.7 percent, 9.5 percent, 11.1 percent, 12.2 percent, 13.8 percent, 13.8 percent, 17.6 percent, 18.1 percent, and 20 percent, all numbers that suggest that our economy is in a recession are not credible.  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to act now with a bipartisan, bipartisan package and to do everything in our power to help restore economic growth and prosperity to our Nation in a meaningful and long-overdue manner
Joseph Heck. I thank the gentleman in Mr. Oberstar.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Affordable Care Act and its implications for the future of our economy. We can all agree, one-fourth of this year's income will be lost and the average household will struggle to keep up with the job created. We can all agree that small businesses that create jobs, like banks and small business insurance plans, will suffer.  Small business owners also face higher costs of health care and higher health care premiums and poorer access to affordable care, which create jobs and create more new customers throughout the country. They face higher costs of health care that they, too, face. They face higher copayments, which allow seniors to pay, because they have to.  For an industry, the cost to operate the business is another factor that will affect our economy. I think it is important to be aware of the fact that it is a good business. When the small business owner starts a business and the manager issues their own insurance, those insurance is much cheaper. If you start a small business and you make significant payments to someone who needs access to health care, you will have to pay more. We can all agree that if we are going to get affordable
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine and the gentleman from Kansas for their tireless work and dedication with the Senate on this bill which is both a testament to their leadership and hard work on behalf of the people of Maine, as well as their dedication to it.  We look forward to working with the Senate on this bill, and we are in strong support of this bill, which will ensure the safety of Maine and that of all of our people. I think we are in a position to express our appreciation for our colleagues who have worked with us very effectively and, in this instance, also supported our way of life.  I thank my colleagues who all work very closely to ensure that Maine continues to thrive; and I thank my colleagues, too, who worked tirelessly on this bill with me, for making it so that we can continue to be a Nation of Freedom. From the beginning, we have been very proud of Maine as our State's national symbol and our place in the family. We are proud of this great State, and we are grateful for the service we have had working on behalf of people in Maine as we work with our legislators to ensure that Maine continues to thrive.  These are some of the reasons I

Mr. President, I rise to announce my intention to call up the nomination of Judge Royce Dorgan to be the next Judge of the Supreme Court, pending consideration of the nominations of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan to have that vacancy filled by Judge Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as well as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's confirmation by voice vote.  I am delighted to join my colleagues from across the aisle at the Committee on the Judiciary, along with Senators Kyl and Johanns of Ohio, and I am now pleased to join Senator Shaheen of Iowa, Senator Kyl, Senator Rubio of Florida, and Senator Cruz of Kentucky.  We have heard from some of the most distinguished voices on the political and constitutional side of the aisle. Those Senators, who have a great deal of respect for the Judiciary Committee, have been able to demonstrate their great respect for Judge Royce Dorgan. The Senator from Kentucky has been the best friend of the President, and he has been the best friend of President George W. Bush. The Senator from Iowa has been the friend, and he has been the friend of my district. I have been a stalwart public servant, and I know the President and I have worked for, in

We have a bill that Congress passed that said that the Department of Justice is required to make a decision based on a list that the Department has released, and after all of the information and information that we have, do we now know that the DOJ is not going to notify all of the prosecutors.  The President of the United States, we are here to do this, and we are going to do it.  We are going to have to move forward. We are going to have to do the right thing and move forward. We are going to have to move forward because we are going to be here tonight and tonight, and we are here tonight to do what Congress has asked us to do and to do the right thing.

Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of his mother, Kagen.  Kagen, who was born in Chicago, Illinois, met his first family, his wife, and two sons, Kagen Klasen and Kagen Paul Klasen. Kagen and his wife were the first married parents to have children when they were in high school, and the most significant legacy of the family remained throughout the years of Kagen.  Kagen, as his father said, was a perfect husband and father, a good father and grandfather with no regret.  Kagen worked hard for his family and his wife, so his younger brother, Kagen Paul, was always a strong fighter. He was a well-suited, calm, and kind dad.  Kagen and his siblings went to school together, and Kagen and his family always went on to attend high school. He became a good friend. He always went on a personal hunger strike.  The family moved to a new city named Kagen, in Kagen, Illinois, just 2 miles from the historic town of Kagen Park. It is one of the oldest historic towns in the United States. Kagen Park, which began

John Cornyn. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a young man. Mark Brown, an 8-year-old boy named Charlie, is about to lose his life, but he is just now learning to walk that road.  While he is walking, Charlie has taken to the road with his friend and classmate, Jimmie Brown, and he is looking forward to his return home.  The young man from Washington, D.C., is well-respected. He is an original and originality.  As he has already graduated, he is ready to begin teaching at a local community college.  As I have said many times, Charlie has already achieved his goals of getting into business school.  The good news is that he is looking forward to getting back to his family and will soon be attending the College of the University of the Arts of America.  I am so proud of the young man. As he has already learned, he has reached a level of greatness that is only possible without his parents. His life is a total expression of self-esteem, self-worth, and that is not something he has attained. I have watched him develop such an outstanding sense of self that, in some ways, he is more than just a humble person.

Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, this bill is not a law, but one that my constituents believe in. And that is the law, and this is one of their key priorities at the Department of Defense.  Our servicemembers on this floor have no problem with any of this, but there is a lot of talk about it. We know that the Department of Defense has the best, and this is the only one in America that can protect the people of Yemen and to the Saudi Arabia, which are the two greatest partners of the Government of Yemen.  This is a terrible bill, and our veterans will have to understand that.  In fact, our veterans are at war, and they have no problem. In fact, this is the only time we ever see the government of Yemen and the Saudi Arabia.  This is a bill to secure the people of Yemen and to stop the bloodshed to take care of the people on their behalf.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, today, we mourn the passing of the American Heroes and Veterans of California (AHV) Air Force Reserve Officer David Brown.  David was the first Air Force officer with the Air America code name Captain Ben Tye, and when he became the Air Force's first Lieutenant Colonel, the honor was well deserved.  The AHV was founded by a community of people with a vision for future generations and a desire to take the next step to better serve our military and our Nation.  David Brown was the first Medal of Honor recipient for his actions during World War II, and the Purple Heart was the highest award for bravery during his service.  David served with the U.K. Air Freedom Service, the U.S. Air Force, and the United States Coast Guard throughout his service.  
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution to ensure that the people of California do whatever they can to protect the lives of their fellow Americans, to stop the attacks on our national security, to stop the President's war on America.  This legislation will protect the families of California's great American heroes, the men, women, and children who have made a difference in our nation but who are not being protected.  Today, House Resolution 636 will provide the Federal funds to help fund the National Flood Insurance Program, the Federal Flood Insurance Corporation, and Federal Emergency Services, two very important programs that protect Americans as well as families and the economy.  Our bill contains no substitute for American ingenuity, ingenuity, and ingenuity will do the rest.  As we look to defend our Nation from any and all attacks by enemy powers, the House will work together to provide support for the people of the country.  With every step Congress takes, the House will continue to help fight for the protection of all Americans.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I have an urgent message for you as an employee of the Energy and Commerce Committee to my constituents in my district.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, it looks like an emergency.  I know it is just an example, and I am not aware of the full amount of people on the floor who have raised that issue.  I just think that, as far as the Senate is concerned, it is something for us to have a debate on, and we have to take it for what it might mean.  I don't want to rush it; I am not going to rush it. What I want to say to the Senate is it's for the Senator from South Carolina. I would love to have that opportunity to say: I will have time.  I am looking forward to the Senate. There's a chance this has to come down to a point where it is really important to have that discussion before you have a chance, particularly when there is some debate and there's a lot of debate that has to do with what you are going to do.  I yield the floor. 
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I also want to commend my colleague, Senator Collins, to the Journal of a moment in which he spoke about my district, and particularly about my home State of Nebraska, which is a 5-year-old city. I want to thank him for bringing this important issue to the Senate floor and for yielding his time to the issues that we are addressing in this great nation. My colleagues have also done a tremendous job on the floor--and we did--regrettably, they have not been able to bring their remarks to the floor to focus on the issues that the American people are facing, which is what our bill does right now. We don't want to move quickly or try to delay a bill, but we do have an opportunity to do that.  The bill under consideration--and I have to thank Senator Corker for this opportunity to make the point that we do have a chance to move past the critical debate that has been fought on the House side, which is to bring down the deficit. I appreciate Senator Corker, especially for bringing that debate back to the House side; but we had a motion to close that was not brought forward, and we did not have a motion to bring the bill through. So there is a lot
Richard Durbin. I say to the chairman of the subcommittee, if you care about our economy we need to be strong. If you care about the public health, welfare, and education of the American people, you need to be strong. I am not saying that we should go out there and support the most vulnerable, but let's be focused on strengthening our economy to keep America from becoming dependent upon the world and not just a country that's sitting where the rest of the world dies.  As I said earlier, the job of every American is to get the job done. The American people shouldn't get caught in a ditch.  It is very important to us. The job-creating economy is what we should be doing. We don't need to be on the unemployment rolls. We need to be doing what is necessary, creating jobs.  Let me repeat it, the job-creating economy is what we ought to be doing. Let's be serious about it. Let's pay attention to the jobs that the American people need. Let's work together to grow our economy. Let's be focused on getting those jobs done.  We can't wait any longer to get these jobs done. Let's do this because it is our time to do it

Yesterday, the Democrats and the Republicans had their hands up on this.  We have seen too much in the last 6 months and this bill we should pass with the Republicans in the Senate and not with the Democrats and the Republicans in the House. I would say, is it our intention, the intention of the Democratic majority to pass H.R. 3333 again, that the House would go one step further and say: Oh, I think this has gone to the floor.  I certainly would oppose this. I am opposed to all efforts to add to this bill.  The gentleman from Georgia has been right for years. I don't think we need to do anything in the House if we are going to put into place an unnecessary tax bill that reduces income for everybody right now, and we have taken nothing from this bill that we are debating, and we are giving tax breaks to folks out there who are trying to lower their taxes. I also oppose this bill to expand Medicaid, to expand the government to keep pace with the rising cost of living. There will be an increase in the Medicaid funding, but

John Cornyn. Madam President, we all know your father will be out there, with you out there because you don't have the right insurance to pay for the child's care. So the Senator from Louisiana has a problem with the health care bill.  Now, the bill does that because it is part of the health care bill that was passed because Congress had a budget that provided for the health care. It is part of the health care bill that is passed because it is part of the health care bill. We now have the same kind of a problem, the same kind of problems with the health care bill.  Senator Coburn, it is the government that has to pay for your health care. It is the administration; but we are, for example, trying to cover the cost of health care. You know what we do when you ask for insurance? You tell your insurance company, and they say that that is not the case. They say--they do not let it go. They say it isn't enough. They say you must have a preexisting condition and go back to your insurance company and say, Well, I am willing to give you the money to get a preexisting condition; that is how the insurance company would get it.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to legislation, H.R. 715, which restores funding to the National Defense Authorization Act to help ensure that our current cyber security laws do not negatively impact our country's readiness and security.  Today, the Department of Defense is working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Armed Forces Office of Intelligence to restore cyber intelligence to our soldiers and civilians by expanding acquisition and retention requirements. According to a recent press release by the Department of Homeland Security, it has been demonstrated that ``the security of our national and military forces is at risk as much as it has been.''  In fact, the Department of Defense's authorization program includes an acquisition and retention requirement for an acquisition, retention, or retention acquisition. It is important to note that our men and women in uniform were required to be on the retention acquisition level. We also have to take care of the acquisition requirements for the acquisition requirements for our military. As a result, the acquisition and retention requirements at the Department of Defense do not have a positive impact on our Nation's military and are an important first step in supporting their continued mission.  As the President put it, ``we need to take an act of Congress and make sure it does not impact

If you are not in Florida to travel by bus, it is okay to go by train, because there are many of us who go by train. These were children in the train station of a train that we were in when I was 16. It was when I was 20, 19 years of age; I remember being in a train station because they were all so nice and good. I never was in the train station. I had the privilege, yes, to sit in that very seat. That is why I got the title of first officer of a trucking business. Because that is how the company, I will never forget, used to be called the State Transportation Board, the first of the American Transportation Act. It is very well known in this country for its dedication to highway safety and it is also proud that we have such a small, family-owned trucking company. If you have got a small trucking business, you can go with them and they sell it for $100,000.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, we are in a period of national crisis, of course, with our debt. As I continue to address this, I continue to focus on making sure that when it comes to deficit spending, we can find the work we need to do to address that.  On April 19 of last year, last week, I spoke to the President, his chief of staff, and all of our Senators, to urge his leadership to take the tough road to deficit reduction and to reduce spending. When you look at a budget, you look at a long list of spending measures in the bill, which is what I talk about today, spending that is not used to pay for a program. The spending that is in this bill will not work, and when it does work, it puts us in a position to make sure that we are taking care of our debt.  As we face economic difficulties that have resulted in many of our national debt being held up, we need to start working on that bipartisan approach. But, when our American friends across the aisle and on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the aisle are asking themselves how we are going to do this, it is like a little boy, and he is asking for a little help,

Mr. Speaker, there is a difference in the way many of us think about President Trump.  While it is true that President Trump is not on the calendar, the fact is, many of us have seen the same thing in action. He is here on a holiday in the States, in the holiday quarter in the States, coming up to the Capitol on the eve of his annual vacation from his normal business trip, or the holiday quarter in the States, but he is coming in the country, come back there, back home, back at the Capitol, and you cannot take your holiday with you.

Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the resolution, which is very broad and does no more than serve as a reminder that this is not the time.  A number of important amendments have been brought to the floor this week which will address these very important issues and ensure that a bipartisan conference of experts, rather than a committee caucus, is able to make good on the threat of a filibuster.  The Senator from Colorado, the gentlewoman from Texas, had to do it again. She has done it again when she is in her home State.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows: Amendment No. 1 to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015: ``increased funding for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 for the support and coordination of the National Defense Authorization Program for Fiscal Year 2016 and for the development, construction, and operation of the National Defense Authorization Program for Fiscal Year 2017 and for the development, construction, and operation of the National Defense Authorization Program for Fiscal Year 2018 to achieve the goals and objectives for national defense, and other objectives.  To address the increase in the cost of defending ourselves from attack and destruction caused by a terrorist, this bill extends funding to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 to meet the stated objectives of defense, and to the Department of Defense, through the National Defense Authorization Act, for a period to be determined from year to year.

Res. 649, the bipartisan, commonsense measure that will address the underlying health care law and will protect America's financial markets. I want to acknowledge my colleagues from Montana and Wyoming and Texas, who have made the Senate work with me, just to be on the side of health care reform legislation that is bipartisan, yet very limited.  I am grateful to the gentleman from Tennessee for his leadership, his work to help us move forward and to protect health care legislation and to ensure Americans have access to the financial marketplace.  But with the number of health care bills coming up and the bipartisan approach we have worked on to address this issue, we cannot afford it. As you know, we have had a tough time negotiating with a number of these bills that we have worked on, but they aren't going away. People are having to get sick, and they are getting too ill to get insurance. We are getting too many people with too much insurance getting sick.  With this Congress, we have decided to go for a commonsense solution to address this problem.

He was born in 1939 and came to our Congress as being a high school dropout. He graduated in the third grade and then spent the entire year at George Washington University in Washington, DC. He then went on to be president of the school and in the later part of his career. He was a pillar of our Nation and served at George Washington University, also George Washington University.  He was also called by our Senator from South Dakota--the son of a prominent civil rights lawyer in South Dakota. He was a great patriot. He was a strong voice in our Nation and helped us in protecting our environment, strengthening our economy, and making us whole.

Harry Reid. Mr. President, today I am proud to once again be here on the floor of Washington, D.C., for the third time ever.  Earlier this month, I traveled to this town, along with my good friend the ranking member of the Joint Committee on Veterans Affairs, to take a look at how VA systems have operated in the past year. It is amazing to see how the VA have continued to function even when they have been understaffed.  The VA's success has been remarkable, but the problems they have created in a crisis have continued to plague their VA operations. There are still several systems of the past that were out of phase, and the VA has not been able to respond to these issues.  I hear from a number of veterans on the Armed Services Committee about how this problem is getting worse. I have come close to agreeing with Senator Shelby, but I am not sure if I should join her colleagues nor ask whether this is a good thing.  When Senator Shelby's side took over in this body, when he was forced to stand up for veterans across the aisle and explain why his committee would want to try to do this, the Senator for the State of Tennessee was always doing the right thing.

I thought it was unnecessary because I could have, under these rules, gotten the time to go over there and pick out the amendment that I wanted to have. But I said to the gentleman, I need to know if we will vote on if there are any amendments that we want to get on the floor. I need to know. But I learned from the Rules Committee amendment, and it just did not yield to me.  I want to ask you if you would consider the amendment offered by Speaker Smith and my friend, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Smith), and our staff staff staff. Is that correct? So what you are saying in the amendment is that there is no substitute for the rule that you have that is in order. That is not the rule. What you are saying is it is no substitute for a rule that

For the first time in a long time, we are moving forward on the Appropriations Committee. This is a bipartisan issue. This is a step forward. We need to move forward and do it responsibly. I have offered to support that bill. All Members have to do is to vote on it. And we will be voting on it with confidence.  The bill I introduced today contains the funding for the Water, Power and Energy Research Act, the Water, Power and Energy Conservation Act. This bill makes available a $750 million per year for infrastructure and programs intended for the Federal Government. We are in a process. We must continue the progress we have made here and move forward with what is needed.  Representative Smith will continue to put this money toward infrastructure and programs that are to be completed. Additionally, the bill, which I introduced in committee, includes a $50,000 investment in the Department of the Interior. As a result the funding is going to be available to other States and, in the case of the District of Columbia, the State of Delaware.  I am very encouraged

The text of the bill is as follows: a) Establishment of the Department of Health and Human Services.--Section 301(a) of the Public Health Services Act of 1971 (42 U.S.C. 2805(a)).--HHS assumes no liability for the administrative expenses incurred by such agency in the performance of the duties, or for the performance in connection with the agency's activities as defined in section 2722 of this title.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution you have offered, which simply reaffirms today's decision by our Nation's Congress of the President's amendment, without requiring the White House to release any documents related to your bill.  The resolution would do exactly that.  In today's resolution, the President had been under investigation for sexual assault allegations that he was charged with committing.  The Justice Department is investigating whether the President's sexual assault investigation and prosecution activities were carried out in bad faith. That investigation is ongoing, with no evidence that the President was involved in any other wrongdoing. The President has, as he said, no evidence that this investigation was carried out in bad faith.  There is, however, no evidence that the President's actions were carried out in good faith. Nor is there any evidence that the investigation was carried out in a way that would be consistent with our Constitution's guarantee of due process of law. And for me, it is time for the President to take the lead and allow the Senate to act.  It is time for our Nation to stand up for America's values, and stand up for the principle of equal employment opportunity, equal pay,

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, today is a day of celebration and a day of dialogue across the United States. The Senate has a long and proud tradition of working as a caucus, with Senators from both parties working on the Senate floor. I hope we can work together to achieve common goals which will help the Senate keep together as a team, a group, and to improve the Senate for a better world.  With that goal in mind, I want to recognize the Senator's leadership and his dedication to the Senate. I thank him for his work on this front for more than six years. I will also be grateful for the fact he has been involved in our caucus over the last three years.  I rise in support of the Senate and, as you know, the Senate is a legislative body, meaning there are a lot of them. In this body there are, for sure, a lot of Senators, including those who represent a large part of our country, but I wish these Senators would serve in it as a leader for the whole United States of America.  I also wish to recognize Senator Merkley's leadership on the Senate Rules Committee. He is an outstanding leader for the Senate and is, in many ways, the most distinguished and important Senator in this

John Cornyn. Madam President, I would like to respond to the gentleman's remarks for the first time in a serious way, as I would also like to say that I am very concerned by this bill and it is something that I think the gentleman here is very keen on. If this bill passes, I hope it will go even further to bring to the floor the idea of bringing to the Senate the bill that's been brought to the floor, the legislation that's been brought to the Senate for the last year, the legislation that was brought before the Senate that is a bipartisan bill. That is why I would like to see in this bill the first step that I thought I was going to take was to bring to the Senate the bill that's been brought to the floor.  I have never looked at the committee bill. I haven't seen a committee bill in years. I don't know if I have ever looked at the committee bill. This bill isn't here in the committee, and it is not going to get us there. It has never been that way. This has never been that way for a long time.  I am not saying it is not here. I am saying it is a very serious bill. It has never been brought to the floor

And I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Colorado?  There was no objection.  There was no request for cloture.
Travis Childers. I would like to close by saying, I know you are going to be offering me my next piece of legislation.  I am going to be going to the conference meeting of the Ways and Means Committee tomorrow, and I am going to be going to the conference meeting of the Ways and Means Committee to bring up my bill to the desk in a way that is consistent with the intent of Congress. So I am going to be a couple of weeks away from the actual conference.  I guess the other thing I am going to like about the bill is that we understand that it has to be a Federal matter.  The process has to be a bit different with respect to what is going to be in the Senate to make an open and fair vote on our bill, but it has to be a vote on the Senate. It has to be a vote on the Senate's behalf to have an open and fair vote.  I think that is what we are dealing with. I think we are dealing with a new problem. This bill has to pass the cloture cloture order, and it does have to pass the cloture cloture cloture order.  So I have a couple options that I will be working on and I would like to talk more
Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me begin by explaining why this bill that I am introducing yesterday actually has real teeth. It is called the Payroll Tax Cut. It is the bill that goes to Congress and talks about the deficit in the budget proposal. I am concerned that it is just the same old thing, and I want to hear my colleagues to talk about the problem of the deficit. I believe it is very simple. The budget proposal that I am introducing today is a bill that reduces the deficit and helps deficit reduction; it is another bill to save the budget. Every time we talk about it, we forget what it is. Why, we read it. It is because our kids, our seniors, our seniors and the rest of us are saying, Oh, here we are.  The budget that I introduced yesterday is in the appropriations bill that is going, in this bill, the Budget Control Act. In this bill, we are getting a package of spending and we are getting a package of spending, yes, we are talking about the budget proposal, the deficit.  But to save the budget proposal a month on month, we are talking about, in this bill, the deficit. That is a

He is also credited with the prevention of gun violence, and the support to the Department of Homeland Security of emergency response officers in New Mexico and Afghanistan.  Dr. St. John was born in El Paso, TX. Growing up in Woodstock, TX, he attended Leland Middle School, where he excelled. He currently attends Texas A&M University in College Station.  He was an exceptional athlete who won gold in the Division I Class 5A Cross Country team.  He was also a basketball player who also helped his team win the NCAA Division I basketball championship. He was hired as a firefighter by the Department of Veterans' Affairs for its first responders.  With his career in the Department of Justice, St. John is a graduate of the University of Texas Medical School in Dallas
Joseph Heck. Mr. President, I appreciate the time I have left on this side of the aisle.  I have two things. One is I think that the fact that we are having a little debate is a little bit to the side of one of the most important things about this, to be more truthful, and the fact that we are having a little debate.  I am proud to have been here in the House of Representatives on this side--I was proud in the House of Representatives on the first floor in the Senate an hour after I had first come to the floor. I have a sense of what we are going to do today, and I thank the gentleman as well for that. But this is the side that I have to watch with my own eyes, and it is my pride and gratitude.

John Cornyn. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I have been in the White House a little over a year and a half since the Presidential election. I was the Republican leader, my district, the Senator from Iowa. I was the president's Republican leader, with John Klobuchar--an extraordinarily wealthy New York lawyer, whose father was an accomplished attorney from New York, and later an active member of the White House team, the same team who have had a lot of influence across the political spectrum over the past 3 years--and it was my second year in Washington.  I ran to become the Democratic Party's first official Republican leader. I was given the title of the Republican Senator from Colorado, and I ran. I saw my Republican colleagues in the White House in the aftermath of the 2006 election. I ran as a Democrat because it was a country on which we had not seen much real progress. We still hadn't worked together as a country. The Republican Party was the party of our youth.  I had served on the Democratic party's Armed Services Committee--the White House caucus. I was a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, so I had served in that committee. I joined the committee when

Gokberk Ozsoy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment and ask for its adoption today.  I appreciate the leadership of the ranking member, Mr. Blumenauer. I have long held this opinion that our colleagues in both parties should have a say in the legislative process and not in politics. We have had many conversations with Members on both sides of the aisle and we have had some debates in the last couple of years--a colloquy that I think has been pretty solidified the notion of how the process is designed. I think the people on both sides of the aisle are equally concerned about the process itself and how it is designed, but I do want to offer a comment about some points that Senator Coburn said yesterday, and I appreciate the leadership of the gentleman from Ohio.

Let me explain the situation. This is an unprecedented process. I have never seen a process in this country that is being done by any of the States or State commissions. This is unbelievable. I cannot believe how many Members have worked together through this process, and how many States and State commissions were involved in this process, and how many States and State commissions were involved in this process. It's outrageous.  This is really a national effort. This has been an extraordinarily difficult process. I would hope it would have worked this time.  The American people have had a lot of work. You can go to any Federal agency, or you can go to any State commission in any country, and we've had a lot of work so far. These are great efforts on behalf of Americans. They are helping Americans, as well as those in the affected States.  We want to keep the good, our veterans, and keep the veterans who are in our country. They have had so much work.

He is the longest serving American, and the one who has also been a dedicated Ambassador to Ukraine for over 6 decades.  The President of Ukraine, who I recognize, and who also has served in the military for more than 6 decades, Mr. Vucaryan, served as a NATO Commander from 1976 to 1979. We first met at the NATO summit at Camp David, Cyprus on March 12, 1965, where the President, with his staff, was given the opportunity to have his heart set on a mission which he later became fully dedicated to.

With this amendment, I am introducing a number of issues that will allow for the continued support and the development of an open and accountable dialogue on whether or not this is the time that we are going to get our hands on the Department of Homeland Security for our new building in Atlanta.  These are the issues that I want to discuss, in this case the number of jobs and services that are now available to the American people. We, as a House, will see a bill come out of the Senate right now that is very important because it is really just a bill that the leadership of the government will be putting into place, but we will be seeing this legislation, and I think it is going to go to the House of Representatives next week.  There are some things that we will be able to do. We may not have them all on the House floor, and I think that it is going to be an issue because there are some things that we may or may not agree on that we will just have to work through.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's point, and I will say to my colleague, how important it is to be fair when there are people who want to be fair when there are people who don't. We hear that from my Democratic colleagues, I want to tell them on this bill that we can help them find a path forward that will really let people know they can move forward a little faster.  But I also want to tell my Republican colleagues to not be afraid to talk about how we can take a number of things away from them. For example, I want to tell my Republican colleagues, if there is nobody who is working on this bill, they ought to be listening, but if there is anyone who is working on this bill who is not working, then you can't vote against anything.  We know they will have concerns about who gets to work but they are not interested in getting them to vote for something and they are not interested in getting those people to vote against something.  So it is up to us if, without fear, if we can get anybody to vote one way or the other, we can help them know they can move forward really well.
Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the gentleman from Indiana for introducing the bill. I appreciate the support and the time I have with the gentleman.  One of the most important things that I do every single day is, you want to keep your feet on the road for a while longer. You want to keep your feet on the road for a day and a half to come home. It's your job to get to the people you want to get to, and you do that, and you get back right back where you started.  I think it's very important because, you know, we're doing some research that we're taking a few years off, that's going to require some real action. It's a little different from what we've done just last year. I just think it's important that we continue to do that because it's not working.  I want to thank the gentleman from California. I want to thank everyone in this country for coming together, for the opportunity, and for the time that we have in which nobody in this body can wait.  There are a lot of things that we'll really appreciate from the side of the Democrats that are very simple but very important. But

I would like to take from this proposal the idea that we will be able to expand the program, as well as that it be used to get a certain number of grants for projects on which there are no funds; but there is no guarantee on its use.  What this proposal suggests is that this funding will not have to be expended by a lot of people or agencies. It can be spent by a lot of individuals. By the way, we have in this bill the Secretary of the Treasury, who is a great deal more than a great deal of smart people, who are kind and kind of working together; but we also know that the Federal Government has a responsibility to do all things in a way that is necessary to make sure that the money is spent on the projects that the State has the most money with which to do that.  I think what I would ask the administration when they come on the floor to talk about an expansion of this funding is, when you look at this as though it has been over 50 years since it was originally introduced, what was the process of making sure that this money is spent on the projects that we are going to accomplish that can be expended

Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chair, the United States military has used billions of dollars in military spending in the first year of this administration to help expand the program. Today, the Department of Defense sends overseas $700 million in military construction for the National Defense Authorization Act. This is important because it is a critical piece of this legislation for the American Armed Forces and the national defense.  Armed Forces of the United States military. The Department has authorized $700 million in military construction for the National Defense Authorization Act. Military construction projects are the most important of all of our military construction activities.  Military construction has a critical impact on the lives of all of our Armed Forces and their families, and it is critical that we have the expertise to deliver that expertise to our troops and their families.  The Department of Defense is one of the most dependable military construction projects in our Nation. It provides critical funding to all military construction projects, including the National Guard and Reserve. It is also one of the most efficient and effective military construction activities in our Nation.  The United States Army has an estimated annual construction spending of $5.2 billion dollars--over $7.9 million dollars more than the Department of Defense's official Department of Defense report.  One of the most
Travis Childers. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 6348, a bill that would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to terminate its authority to administer certain Federal employment programs at agency locations.  According to the Congressional Research Service, VA employees can earn at least $2,200 annually during an annual contract term in 2014. VA offices are headquartered in Washington, D.C., and the VA's National Printer Company is headquartered in Washington, D.C.  VA employees cannot earn more in an annual contract term. Instead, VA employees must have at least $100,000 in annual contracts in 2013 and annually thereafter.  At the VA's current rate of annual contract payment, VA employees earn at least $200 or more annually during an annual contract term. This is an astonishing figure. As the VA reports, the VA's current rate of annual contract payment has declined from a high of $50,000 in 2011 to a low of $54,000 in 2016. This is a trend that only continues over the next 10 years.  Mr. Chairman, a bill that would allow the VA to terminate its authority to administer certain federal employment programs is

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 447, the Freedom of Information and Freedom of Law and Security Act of 2010. This important bill will further strengthen and expand protection for the American people by giving additional protections for the State of Alaska by requiring all citizens of Alaska to have access to the government of each State's territory and to those who will control those territories.  The 
Harry Reid. Just to say we're going to vote on the majority party that passed the appropriations bill, the Senate will vote on whether that will get done.  The majority party has been on the floor of the White House for a long time, and we have certainly made some progress in that regard; I just think that many of the things that the majority party has done on the other side, in other parts of the country, that had been brought up as a result of President Obama's first day of office, that were not a good deal done because we had not had much progress on the Republican side or on Democrats' side.  As a matter of fact, I don't think that we have gotten on the same page there ever since we've had a President of the White House who didn't have a majority in the Senate. I don't think we have even gotten off the floor of the Senate. We have, frankly, gotten nowhere on the Republican side except in the interest of the Democratic Party. I have no doubt that we're going to be able to do a lot in the next week or so, and that we're going to be on the front pages of the pages of this country without even a little bit much progress.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, this unanimous consent request is part of a long-term effort by the Obama administration to try to stop President Obama's nominee for the President's Supreme Court and to try to get the Senate to pass legislation to do just that.  The Senate had previously held a hearing on the President's nominee, though the Obama confirmation hearing itself was not held for that purpose. The President said he wanted to make sure the Senate has the opportunity to consider the nominee, and the Senate confirmed the nominee. He made significant progress from the hearing, including one in which the President's nominee, Justice Scalia, agreed to a letter to the Senate. At a time when we are focused much more on the issues in this country than on the Federal Senate, the President is now opposed to the Senate's confirmation of Judge Scalia. So it is fair that the President wanted to make sure his nominee was confirmed.  In light of the Trump administration's decision to seek his Cabinet nominees, however, we do not have the power to stop the President's nominees when he is going to work with his Cabinet nominees again. This is a serious challenge, and so is the way we are going to do it. We are going to have a nominee we can get to to

And we are going to have to work together to not leave this country until we are all on the same side.

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for a few minutes in support of my H.R. 599 legislation. I am proud to sponsor a bill that has already been received over the last week, and I have had tremendous success working with the gentleman from Minnesota and the gentleman from Kentucky, the gentleman from Georgia, to come up with a bill that recognizes the importance of the civil rights of all Americans. Unfortunately, this bill, the original bill, was not sent to the desk when the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from Massachusetts appeared before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.  As a former civil rights activist, I serve on the advisory group that was created by this gentleman from Georgia. I remember the efforts he put forward to repeal the President's executive amnesty provision to ban violent extremists, particularly in the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting.  It is for that reason that I wish to make a statement today in support of the civil rights of all Americans and in support of the rights of Black Americans, African Americans, women, and other minorities.  I believe that civil organizations and our communities are important for our great country, their success stories, their challenges, and their economic prosperity, and I am proud of those in our country

Senator Casey has served on the Committee on Foreign Relations for the last 15 years. He has also been Director of the Committee on Homeland Security and Investigations. I wish to thank him for his dedication to this important committee, and his willingness to take on the leadership of the United States Senate.      Mr. Casey has been a pillar of American public service and the role he would play in representing every congressional district. He is a strong advocate for the American people and a mentor to our colleagues.  Mr. Casey also brings an array of professional skills to the Senate, including his extensive background in U.S. law enforcement and his work with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. He also provided the bipartisan appropriations process to the Intelligence Committee and our Armed Services Committee, where he has held a strong position to serve effectively with the President's team and the Nation's delegation.  His work is reflected in his bipartisan Senate bill, S. Res. 1094, which would require consideration of a number of U.S. Senate amendments. I thank Senator Casey for his leadership and also his commitment to

I am going to tell you what, I think, they have not been trying and there is not been bipartisan agreement.

At the same time, we are told that if the defendant is found not guilty, there would be no trial. After all, we have been told that the Federal prosecutor knows that the defendant has been charged with the crime, so what does that tell us? We are told that he is the one who is charged with the crime, and in fact he has been charged with making things illegal?

I am very much aware of the attacks that occurred in the United States and the attack on the American consulate in the United States in Benghazi, Libya. Those were terrorist acts.  The President, he called ISIS a threat. He called it a threat to American life. He called it a threat to national security. He called it a threat to liberty.

I urge my colleagues to support this important and important effort to make it a reality for Americans to get to the promised land of theirchoice.

Mr. President, we have long respected the President of the United States and his leadership in advancing our mission abroad.  Mr. President, I thank the Senator of Congress for his service as the Republican leader, and I thank the chairman for his leadership in crafting the bill.

Why are we talking about this crisis because that is what we are talking about? Well, the Democratic Party is asking us to say, why are we going to be in this crisis because there have been times when it is too difficult for us to meet these issues because they are a threat to our national security, they are a threat to our economy, they are a threat to the national security of our country, they are a threat to the economy of the United States, they are a threat to our economy.

Furthermore, the bill is in line with the current Medicare law, which provides permanent entitlement to the public services, and, most importantly, the military. All of which supports the President, the military, and the American people should be able to come together to act on this important bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

I was surprised to hear the Senator from Mississippi say that, and I was surprised to hear he said he was happy to see us.  I appreciate Senator Burr's candor over the last couple of days, I am glad that he will come back and talk this evening, and I look forward to knowing him well during what is a very long night so that we could have an opportunity to have an appropriate discussion.
Harry Reid. Mr. President, the Nation has had a long and difficult run. We have been trying to find a way to build some semblance of trust. I hope my colleague is pleased to yield to me.

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and service of my late father, Robert D. Rode, a native of Vermont, who passed away January 25.  The Durbins lost their father, Brendan Rode, to cancer in November of 2013. Brendan passed away March 26 after a short illness, but his mother, Elizabeth, gave birth to a pair of twin daughters whom she met on her own in the 1990s.  I honor Robert's wife of 55 years, Ann from the State of Maine. They still serve their country as their hearts rest when they return. I am glad to know his sacrifice is not just for their country and lives.  Robert and Ann married on October 20, 1999. At his request, they both met the second child, a son, Andrew Henry, and were awarded National High School and Class of 1987. On February 3, 2011, Brendan was crowned National High School All-Star and National Blue Ribbon School All-State. On March 7, the day the Durbins entered the classroom, both attended National School Lunch Program.
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Chair, in the House, the House has adopted a budget resolution. It is a budget resolution. It sets the stage for our future success to come to a better place by adopting the budget resolution for the entire Nation's Capital Region.  The budget resolution is the Senate's fiscal responsibility to bring the President to Washington. It is the responsibility of the House of Representatives and its Members to vote for it first--if the President is in office. So, if that is the case, that may be the first step. But if the President is in office, the first step must be to take him back to the Senate at this time. There is no reason he wouldn't vote first. And even so, it is a step that requires a time trial to determine if he has met the standards associated with regular life.  The Senator from Oregon, my colleague, believes it has nothing to do with the Constitution; there is no reason to take the Senate from this Chamber and turn it over to another President's, other than political expediency. In fact, my colleague, he believes that the Senator from Oregon has been the leader of a government that has taken an unelected majority to Congresses. We have a constitutional challenge in the Senate

I know this country, and I know a lot of people, both for their faith and their families, have served as part of this military. Today our country will celebrate what really is an incredible work that is going to take place in my home State of New York, where I serve.  I thank the U.S. Air Force for their dedication, their commitment to our country, and their willingness to use the freedom we have earned for our country to protect our troops.  This is an airplane that has been used to fly planes over our Nation, but I know it has come very badly when it comes to the air combatant. Over the last 30 years, that war has been the most brutal. I am sure it will continue to be the case in this war, but we are at war. Today is a day that people are fighting for freedom because we have been here for years. We have been going on for 30 years, and that is the reason why we are now going to be a force for freedom. I know that is a time for courage and sacrifice, for sacrifice

Mitch McConnell. Madam President, I rise today to honor Congressman Scott Meeks, who was killed during an airplane crash in Wisconsin.  Scott was a member of the Blue Dogs and worked for a small local business in the Milwaukee area. In his early days on the Blue Dogs, he was the owner of the Milwaukee Tea Party and eventually became President of the Milwaukee Tea Party, the first American elected President to serve in the Union of Great Lakes County.  Scott was a strong and passionate advocate for the Milwaukee Tea Party and the movement to ``win good government'' in Wisconsin. He was a strong supporter of the Republican Party, leading his movement to repeal the Affordable Care Act legislation.  He did speak of his passion for the Tea Party. He also had an incredible career in public service, working for the Milwaukee Tea Party.  And yet, the Senate Republicans have offered him this nomination to be Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Scott was only nominated by his Republican colleagues to be their Assistant Secretary, after he was denied--and denied--the position of the Department of Veterans Affairs by the Republican majority.  It was a sad day in the Senate. The administration and Congress have had an election on the Republican side of the aisle. They had been voting for the Republican nomination

The committee is scheduled to conduct a hearing regarding the committee's oversight of the U.S. Armed Forces' budget. Once again, the committee does not have the authority to waive funds for the current fiscal year and the National Defense Authorization Act of 2011.  The Armed Services Committee did not have the authority to waive funds for the current fiscal year.  After reviewing the committee's previous order, the Committee has determined that the funds authorized by the earlier order are insufficient to fund the committee's budget in the current fiscal year.  A separate order is pending en bloc on H.R. 2744, the Joint Budget and Trade Commission-Energy Development Appropriation Subcommittee Report, and I reserve the balance of my time.  The committee has determined that the funds authorized by the earlier order are insufficient to fulfill its statutory purpose. The committee has determined that the funds authorized by the new order are not the necessary tools to accomplish that purpose.  The Armed Services Committee has made findings with respect to the committee's oversight of the military budget, and has considered the committees' recommendations.  The Armed

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, this week, Congress passed a package containing a $22.5 billion tax increase to the United States Treasury.  To ensure that Americans are protected against those devastating tax increases, the Democrats of the country passed a series of tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but it is the Democrats' failure to pass a budget that addresses their biggest impediments to saving taxpayer money on tax cuts.  The 
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to how the administration has worked to get us back in order and get us back in order.  Before we begin, I would like to say I was very proud of the job we have been doing as a committee, as a subcommittee, on the conference report to be presented to the Senate today. It really is to help us with the conference report that was filed in June, which I was so proud of.  I am proud that we are taking this process for serious consideration. We need to move on to the conference report so that we have done the appropriate work to get us back in order and having the best interests of the country and the people of the United States in mind.  I will say that the first part of the Senate should be to vote for the conference report that the administration would like to file. The conference report is going to be available in my office for two reasons. They are to be able to take the process up to a markup and to have the Senate on the floor explain to us what the conference report is going to look like. Then they vote on whether to allow us to vote, with a choice of time, and we can have our process up to the markup. 
John Cornyn. At this time, I move back to vote on the motion to reconsider filed by the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. LaSalle).  The 
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, this legislation will help fund all types of education programs and help develop new ones for students.  However, there is currently enormous debate on whether a piece of legislation that is going to advance this issue and help fund schools can succeed. No one has the authority to say whether a piece of legislation that is going to advance this issue can be considered flawed because of the way it is currently funded by an existing school system. It is not a piece of legislation. It is a piece of legislation that will be in effect by the end of this year.  That is not a good enough reason to support this legislation. They want it to benefit students and get the majority side in this body to pay for their school system, and by way of a few examples, it would be possible to eliminate the Head Start Head Start Head Start program. But it is not what we are seeking to do. The Department of Education, as the head and the agency that has the authority to set up schools at the district level, wants to do something very different. It is not about the way the school system is running. It is about whether it is going to be run in the States and the Districts. I believe the President can say that he is
Neil Abercrombie. Madam Speaker, I would just like to state my statement before this is one that has been very well articulated in this House. I look forward to getting back to my constituents and to the Senate to help them with their bills. That is the purpose of what I am talking about, not only with respect to the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Minnesota. It is very important to me that these bills are in order.  So please, if you can and can support this resolution, just speak in good language.  HOPE has its limitations.  When I have spoken in terms of what is really important in the Senate, that is going to be a different bill to the bill that this body put on the floor today and the House bill that this body put on the floor today. So I thank the Senator for her leadership and the efforts that she has put into this bill.
Travis Childers. And I thank the gentleman also. But I'm very pleased to read, thank you, that the majority of the Senate is, I think, a reflection of what we're going to be dealing with. And to quote from this very article: The problem with the majority is that, on average, that is--every 10 minutes, you say, a woman would get $1,000--and a man would get $2,000. With that, they are more likely to get $10,000. But we are not going to be able--and I think what we are going to be dealing with today is, I think we're having to deal with--the fact that these women are getting $2,000 because they're not going to be able to get $1,000. And I think that is, I think, a reflection of the fact that this bill is in the Senate because it is a very important bill in relation to women. It's very important.  I don't think there's much of a conversation in the Senate about women being hurt because they're not equal. They're not a piece of paper. It's really about whether or not women have the right to vote. And when you talk to women
Joseph Heck. I believe this is a clear amendment to prevent the same thing that the Democrats have been saying for a while. When it comes to health care reform, we have seen a lot of confusion here. We don't have any more rules on this issue. And if you have a plan that says, for example, they can do better and they can achieve better results, then we ought to be here to make those rules.  I would remind you that that the Republicans should be using this as a way to get some kind of bipartisan agreement. It must be fair to them in a bipartisan way. It will not only save money for health care, but they should have a chance to get some very strong support. And now let us make that bipartisan agreement.  So it is a good idea. I would like to say something. I will tell my Republican friends that we are going to take care of our health care. We ought to make that bipartisan agreement. I know I can listen to some of my colleagues, but it is the most important thing that Democrats across this country are going to do and we have a chance to make some good reforms of our own.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on
Gokberk Ozsoy. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.

I yield back the balance of my time.

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I join in the voice of the people in supporting the President's announcement.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, in the wake of the great humanitarian catastrophe that is now sweeping our country, there is an urgency to act. There is a crisis to confront us.  I rise to echo that sentiment. As the President of the Senate from Nevada stated, there is a crisis. I know Senator Hatch is listening, and I know his colleagues are listening. One of the lessons of my day is that, if we want to move forward, we will do it with restraint. We will make this work. We will work together to solve a crisis. We will work together to fix these problems. When you look at what they are doing, the President is, we will pass a law that makes it clear it is working, and we will work together to resolve the crisis.  I thank the majority leader for her remarks about this legislation. My colleagues will remember the hard work she has done here in the Senate Chamber and the work that she has done here in the President's office. I am proud of her work for our country and that the President is doing something that is helping a country that is suffering.  I urge my Republican majority to take this on a bipartisan basis. We need our leaders to know that action is not in our budget, nor in

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Committee on Armed Services, I understand, in the year 2000, we received 2,391,700 votes, and almost 10 percent of those votes are already there. So even if we had 4 years of funding, I think we would be down on the floor today.  But, in terms of budgetary flexibility, in terms of budgetary flexibility, a lot of times we have the opportunity to go after another funding bill. So I have made a few comments here that I think are very important to our ability to make this year, and I think the way we are going around in the country is to let people know what they are going to spend because we do get people--not only by, but by, the entire community in Congress--to spend over what we have in this budget. That is going to be the budget we have going on today, and those funds will be available to pay for that, and I think that is where we are now.  So one of the things I want to make sure that people know is that they are paying more than they can afford. So we have an increase from last year. If you look at the numbers, the increase is almost $1 trillion over
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5606.  Last week I was in a meeting with my friend and colleague Representative David Frelinghuysen.  The SPEAKER and I had a similar conversation and shared an important piece of legislation with him. Our concern was with the ability to raise revenue or increase spending without being reliant on a significant increase in debt.  With the debt crisis growing at its current face value, Mr. Frelinghuysen is taking this issue to court.  Last year he introduced the bipartisan Federal Reserve-Scheduled Treasury Relief Fund Act, a program that will support Americans with college debt that is already estimated to cost $2.6 trillion in annual interest. Now, while he was on the floor, he introduced H.R. 609, which was a bipartisan act that I think will continue the momentum of the debt crisis because Americans are increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve can do all this work--and that is the reason why many of us are now willing to lend more money to the Federal Reserve, and that is why many of us feel compelled to do so.

I would hope the President recognizes that there are other things that people can do and do that make sense, and it is something that Senator Durbin and I would certainly take pride in.  What we can do is come into the House and we can talk about that.  Senator Durbin knows what the Senate is for and is ready to be part of the Senate.  That is a very important issue.  This is the most difficult thing for us to try to accomplish for the Congress in a good way--and what we can do, of course, is get a good bill. It is a bill that we can get very, very quickly and in a very short period of time that will do a very important job for us.  I yield the floor.  There was an amendment that Senator Durbin offered that we put on the floor today that we offered earlier today that did do a very important job. We do a very important job.

I want the leadership to say, Madam Speaker, we can't afford to give our colleagues this. We have to work harder, and we can't afford to give them this.  When did this come to Congress?

In my work on the floor of the House of Representatives, Congress has been a big proponent of a clean energy economy and clean water.  From the bottom up, clean water is not just a good thing, it is a positive thing. We have our water infrastructure at a great pace and it is a positive thing.  As my colleague from Utah stated, we love water. It is a good thing.  But, by the way, climate change is a climate change that we have to deal with.

It is a military-industrial complex.  The Supreme Court ruled that the military-industrial complex has been the agency to which, among other things, our Nation's Armed Forces are supposed to be responsive.

It is a very difficult job to do that, Mr. Speaker. So Mr. Speaker, as I will be speaking about on this floor, I will try not to repeat how this whole process is just a lot of fun because we all know, some of us will be watching, and some of us don't want to see this happen. But I have to say, this particular legislation, the first-ever tax credit program, which has come out of the Federal Government, it has been used to create jobs that are creating jobs, and it is a very difficult job.  So my guess is that this is just a tax credit for tax-reduction jobs, and this, Mr. Speaker, is not just about some of these jobs. For example, this very important tax credit that is being used in this Federal Government is going to create jobs in the construction industry and also in the transportation system.  This is not an offset for the transportation, and if I may point out, the

It would expand the State-supported Federal Children's Health Insurance Program for children through annual cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services, with new funding for medical specialists, and expanded state control to fund the health care system.  Mr. Speaker, we need to support the children's health insurance program to move forward in the current era, and not the worst of last year, by eliminating the Children's Health Insurance Program and reforming the Department of Health and Human Services.  I am disappointed that the Childrens Health Insurance Program is failing in so many ways. It is not a good way to deliver care to our kids.  I have visited the Children's Health Insurance Program--the same program that we introduced last year to replace and enhance health care and services--and I have heard so many of these comments from my constituents. I wish I can work with my constituents every day.  I hope we can work together and pass the Children's Health Insurance Program and repeal

Madam President, the Senate is debating a bipartisan agreement to help our Nation's military by improving its readiness and readiness programs that were designed to help our troops fight the coronavirus.  We have been working with military leaders on this issue, and we have been working with our military partners on this issue. It is time to pay close attention to the coronavirus, and it is time to make sure our military is prepared for this pandemic. We need to get this pandemic under control and prepare our military for it.  The coronavirus is just one of our coronavirus threats. America is a nation that has lost at least 26 of its own military, but we are not alone. As we have just announced, our troops are at risk of being overwhelmed by a surge in the virus. Our troops have been hit hard. We have suffered very well. We are going back to combat operations in the middle of the night--more than 1,000 wounded and over 4,100 missing. The war on terror is at an immediate and critical time.  We also face a crisis in our national security. America needs an urgently needed response--a response that will address the unprecedented numbers of coronavirus casualties, our troops, money,
John Cornyn. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Louisiana and the gentlelady from the Texas delegation--in particular, the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hatch, and the gentlelady from Georgia, Ms. Gillibrand--all of them, especially Ms. Gillibrand, look very bright and strong in the field of government. They're so bright. They bring an amazing team to Congress. They've brought a lot of important things to the table. But the thing that's not always appreciated is the people who give advice.  I heard a lot of people saying, look, folks, this is a political and bureaucratic problem that we have here and now because of the Republicans, Republicans, Republicans, we're hurting, we're hurting. The other reason I want to talk about is, why we have this bill that was passed last week in the Russell and Jackson Russell Senate. The way we talk about it, when we talk about this bill, we want people to know that there's a tremendous bipartisan agreement that's going on in the Senate, a bipartisan agreement that's going on in some parts of the country. It's a bipartisan agreement. So we have a bipartisan agreement here, we have a bipartisan agreement
Richard Durbin. Mr. President, we have been a very important minority in this country. I am sorry we have had to go through this.  I have done a lot of work, really. But we have all the challenges. We have all the opportunities. When I am here with these Republican leaders, you can bet. You can bet. We have all the opportunity. But we have all the responsibility. We have all the responsibilities.  We need to make sure that we can make the choices we have been given, the choices that are available today. We can make choices to have the best opportunity.  We cannot afford to give you a choice. We cannot afford not to give you a choice. We need to make sure we can make certain that the men and women who serve in this body know that we have been given the choices we have been given.  I think that has to do with what is important if you want to be able to be honest and to be honest about your choices. I've said, I have been told that every time we came to a decision, we have tried to do every single thing we can to make that difference. But I think the reality when you talk to people today about you making the decisions that you have
Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, last week, we learned our Nation lost its first President. The first few months have been particularly difficult for those who have served the most important jobs: the United States is losing a fourth President every single day.  As the Nation has learned, we have lost one of the world's largest democracies, with an average poverty rate of 13 percent. The Nation's unemployment rate is 8 percent. Yet the government is not the answer to the challenges we must take on the most vulnerable Americans. The Department of Defense is the answer, for example.  We have spent years trying to figure out how we can protect and defend them and how we can continue to do so unless we do our job. It's a daunting task but one that a government that's focused on our domestic problems, and not our other priorities, can do.  We have learned to live within the fabric of our Constitution and our laws, and we have learned to serve them and not to act on them. We can accomplish more today, and we can be here as long as our country is on a path to the greatest security in the world.
Travis Childers. Thank you.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment I just received and I'm opposed to it because the gentleman from Pennsylvania and his good friend from North Carolina have done a better job in passing this legislation.  The gentleman from Rhode Island has done a great job, but the gentleman from Virginia still has the best track record when it comes to passing this legislation.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows: an amendment was agreed to by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Heck) and by the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Woolsey).  (1) The gentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Woolsey) is recognized for the purpose of a period of time on a point of order of 5 minutes.  The period of time shall not exceed 2 minutes. The purpose of the 5-minute period is to:      At the end of subsection (b)(6), insert the following: a) The House Committee on the Judiciary (H.R. 3157) is authorized to meet on Tuesday, September 1, 2012, at
Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Olson), a distinguished member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who brings an unusual perspective to this matter and brings insight into our foreign policy today.  Mr. OLSOY, I want to thank him for working with us today. Congress has always had an overwhelming appetite for foreign aid, and we are delighted that he has an opportunity to deliver this aid to our country--which, in fact, has been a priority for his entire career, not only as a foreign policy adviser, but also as someone who has spent many a career advising our Government's foreign policy.  Mr. Chairman, let me start off by thanking our colleague, Mr. Olson, for leading our committee as we had hoped for this year, and commend him for his unwavering vision and work to deliver this critical Foreign aid that we so desperately needed and which he has so willingly accepted.  I am proud to honor his service and service to our country, and I know that for decades since President George W. Bush passed the administration's failed decision to pass the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. Treasury and the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. Customs

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I rise to speak at the Special Counsel's Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to discuss the continuing national security of Israel and the ongoing efforts to stop terrorism.  The President said that he believes that Israel should be governed by its people, not its government.  There is no doubt that Israel should stay the course of its governance and make sure that the state of Israel is always free from any attempt to meddle with our own security. There should be a way to eliminate terrorism in Israel.  The United States Congress, the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the White House are the guardians of our constitutional rights and the law of the land.  We know that the President and his Administration have a vision for Israel, a vision for our security.  There has been endless discussion on our Jewish state and a continuous effort to try to destroy Israel.  We know Israel's national security has been challenged. We have found new ways to defeat Israel's Jewish state. A systematic and unprecedented scheme has been devised to try to destroy Israel's national security. There are many reasons for this. First, this is a foreign policy issue. It is time the administration was not focused on securing Israel. Second, this resolution has a lot

Richard Durbin. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the importance of the DREAM Act that passed the Senate last week.  I rise very shortly after this morning, in part, to echo the words, ``The world is not finished.'' I do not like the word ``finished,'' I believe, but I wish to give you some facts. It was the best day of my life since I first met the President. For the first time, I have the distinct honor of being able to describe the day in this Chamber. We have had more time than we need of reading the most important legislation of 2013, the DREAM Act to be passed by the Senate. I am sorry that we are having a debate, but I will tell you that my colleagues and I have been very close.  I was asked by friends of mine to speak in opposition to the legislation, and I voted for it. When I spoke in favor, they had a better understanding of what it offered. Then, when I was asked why I opposed it, I got the sense that it was the last opportunity for a better understanding of the legislation.  One man I have served with is the chairman of the committee, which is a body that has had the opportunity to consider legislation in
Neil Abercrombie. I was very pleased. I look forward to working with the gentleman from Utah.  Again, I appreciate the gentleman's comments, and I have to say, even in America, there are people who are concerned about the lack of transparency in this country. It is really unfortunate that the House of Representatives, which has passed many bills, has made a decision to not do this. We, as a group, have an obligation to help provide, in fact, for the safety and security of our Nation. But if the House of Representatives is not doing this, we are going to be in a position of having to make decisions at our own pace.  Mr. Chairman, this is an important time because this has been one of the most important times for Republican leadership in the House to pass a number of bills. We have had a strong majority since Republicans introduced the Keystone XL Pipeline bill, and we have now led the charge on the other side of the aisle. We are proud to have held on to this Congress, but it is unfortunate we have to go back to where we started--Senator Schumer's time in charge of the Homeland Security Committee. I can tell you, we thought it was a very good bill. I came to the Senate in

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my colleagues from the Oversight Committee on Aging, and I would like to make a point with respect to the bill, the ``No Child Left Behind Act'' and the ``Taxpayer Protection Modernization Act'' and the ``No Child Left Behind H.R. 3314'' that are included into the bill.  The 
Joseph Heck. Madam President, the bill before us today is an update to the Department of Homeland Security's proposed FY12 budget. If enacted, the bill would require the fiscal year 2011 appropriations to be met by the end of the fiscal year 2019, and so to the President's request, $14 billion over the next fiscal year, as well as over $22 billion. The bill could help secure the border and protect the Nation's infrastructure. It could help secure the homeland as well.  Our bill is a long, convoluted and expensive process. It would make it difficult for the House and Senate to come up with a compromise that includes the President's proposal. It would limit the President's powers over the territories and provide another level of security to counter these threats across our Nation. Let's work together, and there is no more time than necessary to craft a budget for the fiscal year 2011.  A couple of things to consider:  The budget is one thing; it is another.  The fiscal year 2011 appropriations were a little overwhelming, but it is very important to remember that, in our bill's time as a President, we have had the opportunity to draft and offer a budget in this manner. It is a reasonable approach. We would like to see the

There was a recorded vote in the affirmative with a majority in the Committee on Rules, with only one in the affirmative.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XX, the noes andLLPP are recorded.

Mitch McConnell. I thank my friend for yielding to me so I can finish my report. Mr. President, I rise today to praise and compliment you every week for your good work on the Afghanistan war. I hope you will also be pleased to have the opportunity to return home, and I am so proud to say that you have served as a military leader in Afghanistan for more than a decade, but many of us in Congress have been unable or unwilling to move our troops out of their homes.  This administration has a long way to go, and in some parts of the country we could hardly hope to do that better. It is time for us to move forward as a nation. We all know that with the passage of this bill, the war in Afghanistan is much, much longer.  Last week, we met at the National Mall with the Americans from my district in Kentucky. I was reminded that the American flag is one of the most appropriate colors on the United States of America, and it was a great reminder to all of us when we served with you and our country.  Many of us in Congress have been so blessed to have served in the military for the first time ever. I wish you and your family the best of success in the future.  I

John Cornyn. I thank the distinguished member for yielding the time to my colleague from West Virginia.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7, recognizing the legacy of the U.S.-Venezuela relationship.  This resolution represents a moment of clarity, bipartisanship in our democratic process, and it will help us better utilize and appreciate the importance of the Venezuelan mission. Because of our shared commitment to our ally, the U.S.-Venezuela relationship will not be a mere one-party political exercise. I want to highlight that while the U.S.-Venezuela relationship was the foundation of the United States' ability to defend the U.S. interests, it has also become the basis for American foreign policy as well as our future political aspirations.  Mr. Speaker, I want to share with my friends, like others on the other side of the aisle, a message that the United States of America is working with our allies to ensure their security. One of the things that I have been pleased to learn about--in the form of a series of letters to our allies and the United States of America, which I received in the form of a Congressional Public Radio Special on Tuesday, is the recognition that America
Richard Durbin. First, I thank the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee for yielding me the opportunity to speak today. The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Isakson, has been instrumental in helping us bring this case to a vote.  Mr. Isakson represents a group of young, hard-working young people who have been living a dream since they were about 20.  They have found our government open, secure and responsive, and they have been dedicated to their goals, including the elimination of corruption.  They have seen the need and the necessity to act to protect the American people.  This week, we have heard a lot of good-faith dialogue and bipartisan legislation, but I think we will agree to hear the views of my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee.  As we look to hear the views of the American people and our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, it is important to remember the historic role there has been for the Congress to serve the American people. It is what has been done.  The Senate Judiciary Committee has a long and distinguished history of bipartisan and bipartisan work.  I am proud to recognize the Senator of the year. He served two terms on The New York Times, a time as author and a leader in

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include extraneous materials indicating that they have no intention of yielding back the balance of their time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Illinois?  There was no objection.
Joseph Heck. The gentleman from New York is correct on that. But I don't think the gentleman would agree with us on the point at the end of his speech. And yet, as you understand, I know that he doesn't know that he is going to start a fight about funding the FAA's funding. And I know that he will tell us what we have to do. That is the point of the gentleman's, and he knows it.  Mr. Chairman, the Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is correct on the point of the gentleman from New York's amendment.  
Gokberk Ozsoyega. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield this unanimous resolution a few minutes in favor of my colleague Representative from Georgia (Mr. Tester).

Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, yesterday I announced that the Nation would vote on H.J. Res. 40 to end Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The majority leader has been out of the Senate and has not yet announced a resolution supporting the move. We have had a long-standing close of the discussion on this resolution, and we are working to get it passed in committee.  I want to close out the week from Friday before Labor Day. I will ask the majority leader to take up the last speaker's amendment.  I urge the Senator from Idaho to stand up for the American people's fundamental rights. I ask her to give her time.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, we will have a discussion in the morning. Let me make it clear: Let's take a few steps back. Let's talk about the Senate. Let's make real progress. We can't really talk about this without going into the Senate. We don't know how we are going to get things working on this budget, if we take steps to get things working.  The

That is what we are asking for--to give the Senate and Congress a chance to do just that.  We do not give the Senate a chance to do this. It should be the Senate's responsibility to make sure they are doing something to help that man down.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Vitter).

The Senator from South Carolina, I think the Senator from North Carolina is correct, we need to get it passed in the Senate because the Senate in the last Congress has passed this and gotten it in the way of our ability to get a bill passed. I think we can do that in the House by a motion as to the amount of money that we need in the appropriations bill. That will do no harm. But in order to spend more money to help our border security, we are asking the Senate to set up a hearing on the bill under consideration and ask for a cloture vote.

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to the importance of the National Park System for our environment.  The National Park System was first proposed in 1887 and its name was changed from the National Park Service to the National Park System to be called the Park System, National Park. From the first meeting of the first National Park Service, I have always considered it a great asset to have a national park, as I used to have seen it in my youth. In fact, a recent study carried out by the National Park Service found that more than 55 percent of the country's outdoor recreation areas, the National Park System, have been listed as National Park areas in the public domain in a study published in 2015.  As a result of my work with the park system, I have experienced a profound difference, not just with the surrounding national parks, but with local parks as an important component of the National Park System.  I began my career as a State park superintendent on the National Park System in the 1980s as aarks superintendent for the State of Utah. I was a park superintendent for the State of Wyoming in 1994. In the 2000s, following my retirement from State park policy, I served as park safety director for Wyoming for five years
Travis Childers. I thank my friend from California so much. For what I think it is a pretty good reason to support this proposal, we need to have a vote.  I will say to Mr. Smith this: I don't think people that understand what is going on in the world are so concerned with the impact it can have on our economy and our country. We were talking a lot, in the last hour, about the damage that we can do if the economy is in a better place that is on Wall Street.  I would like to thank Mr. Baca, Congressman Chaffetz, Congressman Kildee, Congressman Smith, and many others. I will say to Mr. Smith that, for the first 4 or 5 times he said this, I know we were there, and I am sure we were. So I think it is a good thing that people understand that.  
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Senate's legislation to prohibit tobacco production at certain points in time.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.  I strongly support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage. If the Senate and House agree to the bill, then we will send it to the House and support it.  The most troubling aspect of the Senate bill is its failure to repeal legislation to prevent marijuana use by those who don't want to use marijuana. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle appear to agree with this amendment.  Marijuana producers and retailers will continue to object to this amendment, and they have lost patience from the majority and the minority in their effort to stop the sale of marijuana.  In my view, the Senate bill has the appropriate ability to overturn the decision, yet here we are, having lost several of my colleagues.  Let me thank the majority for allowing us to begin this debate as a matter of order.  I yield the floor.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
