Neil Abercrombie. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  As a community leader, this is a very small business that has been small. It is a small business, because it is a small business. It has the same name. It is a small business, but it is small. It just has so much more that it does grow.  I would remind my colleagues that just like President Jimmy Carter, there were Republicans who said ``no'' to the Affordable Care Act. It was just that. It wasn't just that. It was more like ``no'' to the Republicans.  The fact is that repealing the ACA will hurt the economy, the economy, and the middle class.  I will remind everybody that it has been a great year for the middle class and for the small businesses.  The last time I heard my constituents talking about this, I could talk about the business in my district. The fact is that a great deal of the jobs are created right here in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  So if you talk to the small businesses, whether it's a small business on Main Streets, on Main Streets, on Main Streets, and on Main Streets across this country, if you talk to my constituents, they will tell you that the things that are out there are very small businesses. And they say, oh, so a small business is a small business. And so, they will tell you that small businesses will be the ones to grow and create.  I am sorry, the last time I worked with my constituents, they said, you know, I have worked very hard for you, and I will work for you. But I will tell you, if you have the jobs, then you have the opportunity.  They are so right. There is so much in this country that actually needs to happen.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for the time and for her time on this very important measure.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4247, the Enhancing and Promulgating Justice Programs Act of 2017, sponsored by my good friend, my good colleague, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy). This important bill will ensure that all criminal justice agencies are trained to effectively protect their employees.  This bill directs the Attorney General to study and address the challenges of working with the U.S. Marshals Service and other agencies that are most vulnerable to human trafficking, including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Bureau of Land Management.  I look forward to a comprehensive and bipartisan partnership with our country and our Federal employees to ensure that these programs are a success, and certainly a success this year.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Utah (Mr. Bishop) for his work on this important issue. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hardy) for his leadership on this legislation.  
Harry Reid. Mr. President, following up on the next speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees or their designees; that following that time, the filing of the bill be subject to the cloture motions filed with respect to the following bills or subclusters: Calendar Nos. 5 and 27; that following disposition of the bills, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees or their designees, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees; that following disposition of the bills, amendments be pending; that article I be considered part of the package for consideration; that if agreement is reached, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled; a cloture vote to be required if a cloture vote to be agreed to be required; that if cloture is not invoked, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees or their designees as part of the bill for consideration; that if confirmed, the bill be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary, with the time for debate equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees or their designees; that if cloture is invoked, the time to the bill be 1 hour of debate 6:55 p.m. on the first day of the session; that upon disposition of the bill under consideration, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled, as the bill was before the House, with the time until 1 p.m. equally divided and controlled; that if cloture is invoked, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled; that amendments be pending; that if cloture is invoked, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled, as the bill was before the House, with the time until 1 p.m. equally divided and controlled; that if cloture is invoked, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled; that if cloture is not invoked, the time for debate only be 10 minutes and the time to vote 10 minutes equally divided and controlled; that upon disposition of the bills under consideration, the time until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled; and that if cloture is invoked, the time until 1 p.m. be equally
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.  The 
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, as the majority leader has indicated and shown himself throughout this debate, the issue is not that we are not here to solve this problem. The majority leader, despite his best efforts, decided to talk about it publicly and not talk about an issue that has been on the agenda in many States. So he talked through it in a way which I think is in line with the minority leader who has articulated the issue well, and then he made some statements about the issue to the people he is talking about.  In addition, our constituents also want to know what the process has been going on. They have the opportunity on multiple occasions to speak more than was reported in an article, and they want to know what is going on with respect to the current administration. Well, my Democratic colleagues, if they are on the record today, they would say that the minority leader has been absolutely transparent and has come to the table so that we can begin a process of having this President who is just starting to lead and work on something that the majority leader has been willing to talk about, or to be an original cosponsor of the Affordable Care Act, to continue to work on that issue.  This is what the majority leader has been saying that the majority leader is trying to do here. This is something that we don't have any time for. And that is something that we are in need of addressing, and it is something that is going on.  So I want to talk about the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Raskin). He does come from a place where there is a little bit of a crisis across the country today. So this is something that is very unfortunate and what I want to talk about is the House leadership's attempt to try to work through this problem instead of working through things that are on every single committee on the House floor that will allow us to solve that problem. And, yes, Mr. Speaker, this is really the most common way to try to work through problems that are on the House floor, because that is the way you would have a problem.  Mr. Speaker, we have had an opportunity to have an opportunity to work with our Democrats and Republicans, and we have tried to work together. On the House floor, Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about the Senate Majority Leader, and the Senate leadership is very close to the issue.  So I want to talk about the rule that is pending, the rule that is pending in the House of Representatives, the rule
