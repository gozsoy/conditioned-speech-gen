Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Senate to support H.R. 876 and urge the House to vote on H.R. 880.  The CHAIR. The Senate accepts amendment No. 877.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman from California is very pleased to be joining this conference in our efforts to develop better ways to reduce the costs and the health impacts of our food industry. But I'm just wondering why he doesn't just stand up for the farm bill and get it passed.  As a father and a husband and a child in my extended family, I know it may be tempting to try to do the same for our hungry children, but a lot of people don't have the confidence in their own ability to do this. I know they can't afford to change the rules, but I also know we are still in the process of trying to keep the farm bill that we have been doing for the past 10 years from coming out.  What we are trying to do, at least in my home State of California, is focus on how you can keep making the food that is available. We are trying to make sure that our children have the nutritious choices available to them. So in keeping with what we did for the farm bill and all the changes that have been implemented, we haven't just laid out a budget that is based on getting the food that is available.  With that, I also recognize the fact that the food industry
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Senate's efforts to hold a vote on a pending bill that the President has signed into law.  The bill on which I support the majority leader is the so-called ``H.R. 2592,'' a bill that was signed into law by President Obama. It provides for full Senate passage of a broad-based program to encourage the military and other civilian communities to provide service-oriented training and readiness education specifically designed to equip U.S. military personnel with better training materials and skills.  The Senate now faces a long-term continuing violation of the law, which prohibits the President from passing regulations that prohibit the use of military equipment. As a result, the President faces a number of issues that would likely affect his ability to carry out the Senate's efforts to bring the bill to a vote.  First of all, the Senate is not permitted to hold a vote on the legislation. It will be at the beginning of the next legislative session, before we vote on the legislation, when it becomes law. However, the process for the Senate to vote on a bill is as simple as it may seem; it begins with, as we have outlined at the outset, a ``yes,'' a ``no,''
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, my amendment to H.R. 3033 is to exempt U.S. Customs and Border Protection from reporting to the United Nations Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Union.  Customs and Border Protection is authorized to make and process such data relating to the enforcement of illegal drugs in the United States in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in the U.S. The Customs and Border Protection has the right to rely on this data for purposes of the Convention on International Trade in the U.S. The data which we collect is primarily the product of intelligence gathering by the United States and other international criminal organizations.  Section 6 of H.R. 3033(b)(2) explicitly prohibits the collecting of intelligence data relating to drug smuggling and drug trafficking by the United States. Section 6(b)(1) also prohibits the collection of intelligence data pertaining to the United States and other international criminal organizations relating to drug smuggling and drug trafficking.  In light of the pending legislation, I would be delighted to join in this amendment on the floor.  
Joseph Heck. Madam Chair, I am not sure how to answer Ms. King's question. She just said that, in essence, she just saw the last of the votes from the Senate, and she is saying it was the last of the votes. So what is the point of the final vote? Well, I think I will just respond by saying that the last vote was very close and that the fact that we have only two Senators being voted out of the Senate is something to be thankful for. So the question is where was the final vote?

Neil Abercrombie. Mr. President, I move to proceed to debate the bill (H.R. 5447) as in the usual form.  The 
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the life and career growth of George W. Bush, as president of the American Society for the Prevention of Drug and Alcohol Addiction.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor the lifetime commitment of George W. Bush, the world's first victim of alcohol addiction and to highlight the continued support for prevention.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the continued leadership of George W. Bush in the United States Congress.  Mr. Speaker, we must not forget that the life of our President and our President's father came to the fore in the early 20th century. This ``no'' was a very long time.  George W. Bush was born on October 9, 1918, in Chicago, Illinois. His parents were immigrants, and George W. Bush was educated in Chicago and the University of Chicago. He attended Chicago Teachers College, where he was a teacher in 1942 and 1945. He then went to work in a plant in Chicago.  George W. Bush went to work in a plant in Chicago and served in the Army at the beginning of World War II. He was deployed to Afghanistan. This time he was stationed in Iraq.  This time, he was deployed to Iraq
Harry Reid. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to former House Majority Leader Reid and his legacy, who recently stepped forward to be chair of the Homeland Security Committee. Today we have the first Republican in the committee to chair the Homeland Security Committee and the first to have a vote on H.R. 2. We look forward to this opportunity to thank the great men and women of this great body for their service and dedication to our country and all of their constituents.  I look forward to a strong leader in this Chamber, the Senator from Connecticut, who was a great leader, an original jurist, a great advocate, a great Senator, his wife, and a great friend.  I want to wish my friend, myself, and all my colleagues a happy and happy retirement.  Our House, along with the Senate, is the longest closed, most partisan, and most partisan in the history of this country. But our House is the longest closed, more partisan, and most partisan in America.  The Reid hearings on the Homeland Security bill will serve as our longest lasting advocate for the American people and the Nation. I look forward to working with our Senate counterparts to ensure that our Senate has the wisdom and conviction to step forward from the very beginnings of this
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I, along with Senator Durbin and many others, wish to take a picture of the people of Pennsylvania. You know the story of the people of this country where their names are engraved on the wall behind their homes.  When they were asked one, they were happy to talk about how beautiful they are; how they live their lives, and how they work together. The people of this Commonwealth feel the same. They are very proud of those homes, and what they have found together is a family that has thrived, a family that has grown into a family that will grow and that will prosper through years to come.  My name is Daniel Jordan. I have been working for 23 years as a lawyer in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I have worked in the defense of the people of the United States for 4 years. I have worked for nearly 2 years as a judge in the American Indian case. In these times, I am a Member of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I believe, to me, what these people have realized is very important and that can be done.  I wish to thank my colleague for her service, Senator Durbin, who has been a very good friend to many of the people of this country.
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 83, I was away from the Capitol due to a prior emergency. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea.''
