Neil Abercrombie is a former school principal and a member of the board of trustees.  He was elected to the first term. Abercrombie is the son of a former teacher and father of three girls enrolled in public schools.  When he was a teenager, he attended the San Francisco Unified School District from 1971--1974 so that he could begin teaching.  After he received his bachelor's degree in 1974, and earned his master's by 1975, he decided to focus on his profession, starting by focusing on the school he attended.  He chose the school's mascot, a red-headed cat, in 1976, and the school's motto, "Eternal Achievement."  Abercrombie was a member of the board of trustees for five years and chaired the board's curriculum subcommittee.  He chaired about 15 committees, and helped found and serve on the committees of the boards of trustees from 1976 through 1983; he was secretary of the board from 1984 through 1987; and chairman from 1988 to 1992.
   --Rough Love.  This young man was a member of the board of trustees from a small town in the southern part of the State.  His father was a graduate art college teacher, and he graduated in the same year that his father was an academic.  When he was young, he had trouble sleeping on the floor due to the fact that, while playing college basketball, he was allowed to play in a dormitory.  Eventually, he started to do so, and the school's mascot was lost. His only accomplishment was to get his first job on the board of trustees.  He left school, and left school for a small number of years at least; he moved away and chose to graduate from the University of California, Berkeley in 1977.  He became superintendent in 1979 and then chairman, and elected to serve on a small number of committees from 1992-1993. This young man's only accomplishment was to get elected to the California State Council.  The committee, he is credited with, created a community that supports and serves on the committee's board.  A small number of members of the board were elected to serve on the board's committees; three of them were elected to serve simultaneously.  Abercrombie served on the board of trustees for 18 years until 1972.  He was a member of the board of trustees for three years and chaired school committees from 1972 to 1976.  He chaired the board's committee subcommittee from 1981 to 1993, and chaired the committees of the board

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment.  The State of Nevada has been the subject of high-level bipartisan debate. It is important to note that the amendment is not merely an amendment; it is an amendment to the Constitution. We have a unique opportunity to repeal or replace the law.  This amendment will help us make a dent in the debate.  The Nevada delegation is a formidable adversary.  This amendment is why we should be making the amendment to the Constitution a reality, so that it will give the State of Nevada some serious recognition.     Mr. Speaker, in an era of increasing government spending and spending in the United States, the State of Nevada is no longer the one with the money. We are now spending $100 billion on programs and services that help communities and families remain well-served.     The State of Nevada is home to the highest rate of unemployment in the country.  The state has spent more money on programs and services than the federal government has.  During the financial crisis, Nevada's debt was estimated at $3 trillion, more than all the federal and local governments combined.  When the state was re-balancized, $43 trillion in spending money poured in.     But this money is still flowing through the Nation's money-borrowing programs.     It is the debt because the State is bankrupt due to the unsustainable spending of taxpayer dollars.      The Federal Government is funding the national debt for the American people. This amendment will ensure that we have a fiscal disaster that needs fixing.                                                                                                              I.
                                                                      
Neil Abercrombie, Chairman, Chairman, in an interview last week, I was delighted to hear some of his concerns. I was able to work with him that he had the capability to do both in a short period of time, and the ability to work with very focused subjects. I had the ability to work with a group of a few people, and it was a very timely time. One thing he was very confident in is that he could come together fairly quickly. His focus was on helping young people graduate from their undergraduate degree programs. He was able to give a good background on college applications, and he helped bring the focus to doing work for a company that had more than enough money to do it. That gave him the ability to work through a lot of different issues simultaneously. His work force was there, and they were willing to give him a shot. He had the ability to work together, and he was able to work together very efficiently. During the course of his active involvement with the Board of Education, he was able to work out of the back of his chair, and he was very capable of working through these issues simultaneously. His focus was there, and he was able to take some of these issues together. When I say this was a very productive time that he had been having, it was very helpful. 
Lloyd George, Chairman. Of course, I would urge that we consider this a form of job-security concern. It would be inappropriate for us to comment on this on the record.  I would hold my breath. It is appropriate that we consider this an issue that Congress has jurisdiction over.  As a senior fellow in the Department of Education, I think the point I was making was correct.  I think that this is a form of job-security concern that we have jurisdiction over, and that's why we're discussing this matter with the Chairman and my colleagues.  My colleague, I am an associate director of the Federal Communications Agency, and I am a professor of communications at the University of Nevada, Santa Barbara and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. I have worked with a number of other agencies that are trying to force these kinds of regulations on their employees. Even more recently, the Secretary of the Air Force, to address these issues of concern to the families of our Armed Services employees. That's why we need action from the Federal level.  But we can't afford not to look at this issue now.  Of course, we can't afford to do this. I

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment from Senator Ed Markey that would grant me the vote for this new amendment.  I am confident that this amendment is contained in the intelligence community's amendment form.  The Intelligence Authorization Act includes a provision making it necessary for the intelligence community to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.  That amendment also includes another provision making it necessary for the Intelligence Authorization Act to include language that instructs the intelligence community to vote ``yes'' in the amendment.  That amendment also puts an end to the use of the term ``arriving at a workplace'' in intelligence policy by allowing for the use of the term ``arriving at home'' in a situation where the workplace is on the American family or within the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's intelligence assistance area.   My amendment is in the act.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
Neil Abercrombie, I must be reminded that while we must ensure that we protect our physical form, as we are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, there are also a number of new forms of radiation that we are exposed to in our daily lives. The most prominent are so-called "expositized" radiation, such as those we are exposed to during school and work. We are exposed to many types of radiation that we are not. But the fact is, the more exposed we become, the less our energy is used for propulsion in our daily lives. As a child my father was an avid fisherman and we did all we could to help him. My mother and I were fortunate to share a few fishing lives and a few families we had that were lost in a man-made river. It was a good thing our country did just that when there was such a thing as a man-made river. I am blessed to say that in the last 50 years or so I have seen an explosion of new forms of radiation that we are exposed to. Of course, it is only a matter of time before we see that new form of radiation that we think is a safe one to live with. As a young man I was exposed to the idea of trying to make some of our country's only commercial fishing areas safe for everyone and to put food into the children of the people we serve. That's what it is, and we must change that. But I will tell you that it's not so. I've already had the idea that I've got a few thousand dollars in my pocket, as I have a few other businesses, and I think that these new things are a win for everyone. I see no solution to this. I see the solution. I've had the answer, and I think I've got the solution. But I want to know why I've got the answer now. I want to know why I've got the answer for sure. I want to know why I've got the answer for sure. I want to know why I've got the answer for sure. I want to know why I've got the answer for sure. I can't even begin to tell you how much I enjoy talking to my employees. I've had the opportunity to tell them the truth as I've had the opportunity to tell them the truth. I've had the opportunity to tell them the fact that I can help them live up to the vision that they have that they have that they are safe for everyone. I want them to feel a

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully request that during your deliberation on the point of order that you would consider the fact that we are debating the law in its current state of flux.  The resolution of this emergency is not a matter for partisan debate. It is an issue of serious public concern. It is an essential part of our national interest and it is vitally critical that we pass this bill.  The time to pass a resolution is short.  We cannot afford to be sidetracked by a partisan resolution.  The essential issue before this committee is whether or not we allow this kind of spending-burden financing in our economy.  That is why I urge my colleagues to hold accountable the Federal Government for its unsustainable fiscal and economic policies.  This is our Nation's job now, and we must not allow our way outs on this issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Neil Abercrombie (politic), too many of us are too happy to be able to say very negative things about our government. I think that's a shame. Instead, we should change the fact that government officials are personally accountable for their actions. Again, I don't think that's a solution. I think that we both have a duty to provide the resources and latitude our taxpayers deserve. But in its discretion, we should allow government to fix the problem. We should make sure that we're fixing it right now. I'm confident that our intelligence community will do the very best for our country. In our business, every taxpayer has a debt management plan. So let's give government enough time to make the plans. Let's grant taxpayer's right to back its chosen cause back. Let's put money into education and into the security and training of government troops, and let's give government the resources and latitude it needs to fight back. In its most recent budget, I've still to do at the request of the congressional committees of jurisdiction. But I think we've got a sustainable, fair and we can say yes to that. I'm confident that we can afford to go forward with this. But we must give government enough time and resources and latitude and that's the goal of the spending cycle. That was the goal of the program. That is why we need to give government enough time and resources and latitude and that's why we're fighting back. That's why I support that.                onica



We now have a fiscal crisis that includes all of us who support fiscal-budget solutions.

Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I rise today to reluctantly oppose the gentleman from Montana's 7th congressional district's amendment--that the CHAIR. The gentleman from Montana's 5th congressional district is no threat to the country. But for reasons we're not comfortable with. The second CHAIR, H.R. 5724, was passed last year by both the Montana Legislature and the Interior Department.  Even if passed by both the House and the State House, the gentleman's bill is the most recent incarnation of a serious environmental environmental right violations against the Montanaifer--and it is this bill that has saddEN The Montanaifer--which the gentleman from Montana's 5th congressional district brought to light. One reason for the recent passing of the gentleman is a number one reason why the gentleman is the only other member of the 5th congressional district to have an open letter of support for a proposed project in the State of Montana.  The gentleman from Montana's 5th congressional district does have an additional reason: The CHAIR is signed by well over 25,000 citizens and posted at every square foot of a public place. One reason for the CHAIR is due to recent environmental law litigation. But the gentleman from Montana's 5th congressional district did have an additional reason for its enactment. Under the legislation, the gentleman may not have signed the CHAIR because he or she was not a registered as a resident of the State of Montana when the CHAIR took effect.  The gentleman from Montana's 5th congressional district passed this bill in the name of our city's residents, and they deserve better than that.  This bill does include some serious environmental issues, and it's the second time this year's CHAIRs been signed.                                                                                                                                                                   
Neil Abercrombie e.I.aynley/ Washingtonobin. Washington is the country that has the most unemployment rate of anyone in the World. It is 9.6 percent in the U.S. That is 3.36 million people. It is the second highest unemployment rate in the World, behind England and Japan. It is the second highest in the world, behind the developed world. It is the fastest in the developed world and is the most expensive in the Middle East.  The number one financial institution in the United States is the Bank of America and it is the most affordable in the World.  The Bank of America and the Worldinformatics Corporation both offer online financial services that costs money. Online banking is the most affordable type of financial services that are available in the World. Online offering of credit unions, tax cuts, and other financial services that are available in the World. Online offering of education, business, and financial services that are available in the World.

Joseph Heck. And we are fortunate that the Acting CHAIRES this important piece of legislation. I applaud the gentleman from Montana's amendment.  Two years ago, we fought the drug war. One year ago, we fought the war in the United States. Two years ago, we fought the war in the North Atlantic Treaty (the Piedmont). Two years ago, we fought the war in the South Pacific.  I will tell you exactly what was accomplished. I will tell you what was accomplished. The first two years of the war, 987 had been about military benefits for the American people. The idea that we could keep a military honor good for the United States while suppressing the will of the people to exercise that honor was a national security issue. But as we got to the point where we were forced to reexamine this problem head on, we needed an all-volksenstveeponductor to work on, and we are fighting this battle withus.  I will tell you exactly what was accomplished, but the key is to recognize that what was accomplished was not accomplished. The fact is, the answer to all of our problems is more love for our country and our nation, and more America's debt than the WorldinoaYouCute guy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Neil Abercrombie, Acting ALEXANDRIA, country outside the protected areas, this news release isungle.  The name is a mis representation of the Arabic for "strongman." It is indeed a well-known fact that when the word "strongman" is used in a derogatory manner, it is usually done in a derogatory manner. This is especially true of the word "bimbo."  The term "bimbo" is used in the derogatory sense in an effort to convey the term's vulgar, offensive, and perhaps even insulting meaning.  The government should be doing a few things very, very poorly. For one thing, the government should respect our choice of language. For other reasons, we do. These things can make the difference between life or death.  As a child, I was a very able schoolteacher. I grew up in a budget-barging household. My father worked part-time and came up through the government for a few months while I came through with a serious business mind. He was a great man, and I will never fully agree with his ideas about life or the government.  I will say that we now have a government that is about individuals, not the government.  I grew up in a very small town in the South of France. I have an article I wish to share with you that stated that the government should respect our choice of language. The government should respect our dignity.  The government should respect our intelligence.  The government should respect our core concern for everyone, not just the sick, injured, or forgotten man. The government should respect our needs and allow those needs to be satisfied without our hearing-required changes being enforced.  The government should be accountable for its actions. I applaud its actions, but I am not municipally a lord of the word.  I am a man of few words. I am a man of few words who has learned to speak the English of the times. I have never felt more capable than I have being voiced by a man who has been doing the talking. I am not saying it is a complete waste of time. I am saying it will benefit the people who use the word.  I am confident that the government will ensure that we are speaking the language we love best--the bestlanguagealltheworldover.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to recognize Dr. John W. Becher, founding president of the American Chemical Society, a man who has literally never before been recognized for his work on the toxicity of aluminum.  As a physician in the emergency department, I know Dr. Becher's work on the toxicity of aluminum. I also have my say in how and when it is brought into the emergency department, and what, and why.  I've seen the work that he has done and that I've seen him have done in the past. But I'm the lone survivor of the last two decades of an era, and I'm the lone survivor.  I've seen his work, and I've seen his work, and I'm proud to say that I've seen his work.  I've seen his work. I've seen his work. I've seen his work. I've seen his work. I've seen his work.

Neil Abercrombie, Mr. President, I rise in support of a bill that would force the U.S. to take more active account of local and regional issues, such as the effect on the quality of life, the number of children and the ability to work outside of the home. The legislation strikes the appropriate balance between the need for local action and the necessity for efficient local programs.  The burden is on the U.S. to provide the resources that are necessary to fight the tide of the change. The National airstrike is that 100 percent of the time, action is taken by the local level. I urge our national leaders to take more active account of local and regional issues, and to force an all-out change.  I urge our nation's regional and local leaders to step up to the plate and give the U.S. the ability to make a stand-alone change.  I urge our regional and local leaders to stand up to the Jones family and to the Nation's misadventures and to get behind the change that is a good thing more than a bad thing.  The Nation's cholera is not about food or water; it's about the safety of our servicemembers.  The Nation's growing debt is the result of misadventures and misfortunate working environments.  The a.m. that's got to happen.  The a.m. that's got to go.

Neil Abercrombie,  Madam Speaker, In the 21st Century, we must not allocate resources without due process.  In the past, we have had a tendency to allocate resources on the basis of human-readable shortfalls. Our entire family is affected by a single set of health care problems that don't include the kind of problems that are the focus of this fall's

Neil Abercrombie, Acting U.S. Attorney. One of the major reasons for this crisis is the unsustainable levels of U.S. debt. As a businessperson, I know that it is vitally important to have an environment that is conducive to reducing the levels of debt that no American has experienced in the last decade. This includes a healthy working life, free from work-related concerns, affordable health care, and safe universities and research communities. Additionally, a healthy student-private education environment contributes to the successful education of future generations. As a physician, I have concerns about the quality of life of the young. I think that our current economic system is creating opportunities for a different set of concerns. Forcing the schools to close will only encourage further delay. Additionally, the government has a tendency to promote laziness, overcompletion, and under-dependence on private capital and willing students. These two trends are driving this problem. What can be done about it? America is in the midst of a critical time investment in our economy. This investment will provide Americans with the resources they need when the time comes. I urge my colleagues to embrace the times that they are in order to fully realize their dream of creating a fully functioning economy.

Joseph Heck. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 9, instructing the committees of jurisdiction to report legislation to replace the job-killing health care law with a more patient-centered set of reforms. This replacement resolution is the first step toward fixing the recent job-killing health care law's serious problems: more than $150 billion in cuts to Medicare, and $150 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage; crippling taxes and mandates on small business that cost Americans jobs; and overreaching Federal policies that place bureaucrats between patients and their doctor. As a physician, I see firsthand the need for change. What was signed into law last year did include some good ideas, such as: allowing dependent patients to stay on their current Medicare stay until they're 65 years old; eliminating lifetime caps on coverage; and covering individuals with pre-existing conditions. However, these policies were coupled with unsustainable spending that saddles Americans with debt, and compromises their access to quality health care. The American people deserve better, which is why we need to go back to the drawing board and develop solutions that provide stability and security for those with health care, options for those without, and rein in spiraling costs for everyone. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this Resolution, so that we can get Americans back to work, and give them the health care system they deserve.

Neil Abercrombie, Mr. Chairman, I am here to allow the gentleman from Indiana, who is the chairman of the gentleman from Michigan, to come out and put on his uniform, the shirt that he has been wearing for 17 years.  We are at a critical time right now. The United States is a very large place. And as a physician, I have to say that I have never been a happy man. I have never been a happy man in my life. I will tell you that being a physician in the Army of God or in the intelligence community, I was happy before the World War II. I am happy now. I think that if the United States of America were to be included in the military community, that they would do well.  I grew up in Indiana. The country was part of the Hoosagoondi Reserves. The land that the United States currently sits on is literally in the hands of the Manappech Tribe. The man who put us on the front lines most recently was General MacArthur. He was a really large man, and that is why he helped push us toward nuclear weapons. I grew up in a very small American household. I will tell you that I grew up in the South Pacific Islands, and I will tell you that I grew up in the South Pacific.  I grew up in the United States. I studied at the University of Santo Tomas and at Louisiana State University. I have an occupational specialty, a physical kind of military occupational specialty. And I would put on my uniforms and say, This is a Marine Corpsman from Indiana, and he would represent him in the United States Marine Corps.  I grew up in a very small American household. My father was at work in the military at the time of the terrorist attacks in February of 2001. He was drafted into the Marine Corps in 2005. He was promised the Marine Corps. But, as he said, in the military community there is a thick build-up in the physical kind. I mean, when you are a physician in the Army of God, and a physician in the Intelligence Community, what do you say to that? I am trying to help, but I can't do it. I am not here to force you. I am trying to get to the bottom of this.  I will tell you that I am not here to force you. I am trying to get to the bottom of this.  I am here to listen.  I am here to listen to the best for

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to recognize Dr. Harry Rosenberg, founding president of Roseman University of Health Sciences.  In 1999, Dr. Rosenberg rented a small office space in Henderson, Nevada, believing he could establish a pharmacy school that would produce highly skilled graduates ready to be recruited for work across the country.  His innovative approach to education led him to develop a block format curriculum that emphasizes a student-centered active learning environment, allowing students to participate in experiential education from the very beginning of their studies and complete their doctoral degree in just 3 years instead of the traditional 4 years, making Roseman one of the most affordable pharmacy schools in the Nation.  During his tenure, Dr. Rosenberg helped transform Roseman from a local school of 38 students to a regional institution with over 1,000 and offering an array of quality programs in nursing, dentistry, and business administration. As he prepares for retirement, I commend Dr. Rosenberg for his vision, innovation, and commitment to offering students an affordable, state-of-the-art education that has and will benefit the State of Nevada and the Nation.  The Dr. Rosenbergs are now at work creating the nation's second most popular pharmacy school, and isabelle.org is a must have.  The students at Roseman will be the envy of the nation. They will receive an affordable, state-of-the-art education that will benefit the State and the Nation as they know it.  The Dr. Rosenbergs' contributions have been recognized by the institution of their vacant vacated vacated vacated vacated vacated vacated vacated vacated vacated vacated (OVC) vacated vacated vacated (OVC-) vacated vacated vacated (OVC-) vacated vacated.  The Dr. Rosenbergs are doing incredible work to make Roseman a reality. I am proud to say that I am not. I have no doubt that the Dr. Rosenbergs have accomplished the goal their students have been seeking. I am confident that the Dr. Rosenbergs are not the first and that the Dr. Rosenbergs must be the last.  The very existence of the Dr. Rosenbergs is a painful, lonely, and lonely place to be. And we cannot let them go without aussions.  The Dr. Rosenbergs are there to help. They are there to stay. And their absence will not be the end of their work.  The Dr. Rosenbergs are there to help. And their absence will not be the end of the world.  The days of protecting

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, Thomas Jefferson said: ``Laws and institutions must go hand-in-hand with the progress of the human mind.''  As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.  Almost 30 years have elapsed since this Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act; and over that time, technology and scientific knowledge have evolved and, indeed, new discoveries made, truths discovered, and opinions changed.  But for some reason, Congress still clings to technology from a bygone era to address today's nuclear waste issues.  The fact is, sticking our country's nuclear waste in a hole in the ground for long-term storage is a 20th-century solution. Instead, we should encourage the use of a 21st-century technology.  My amendment redirects money from the nuclear waste fund and designated from Yucca Mountain licensing and waste storage into the development of a 21st-century solution, a fuel recycling and Accelerating the use of the Mount Kisco project area. This program would significantly reduce the toxicity of nuclear waste and retrieve additional energy from the material through radio chemistry and subcritical technology.  I am confident that the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will recognize this 21st-century solution as within the realm of possibility.  The U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act is a step toward containing the crisis and I applaud its intent. But I also have to acknowledge that the U.S. has a long road to******`uplibing'' your nuclear waste.  My amendment includes language allowing for a 7thC.

Neil Abercrombie and his friends are doing incredible work to make these ideas that we share a reality. I applaud their dedication to restoring proper accountability and oversight to the government. I am confident that the American people will continue to exercise their sovereign right to ensure their safety and well-being.  President Barack Obama has said that the government has a responsibility to oversee, but that is not the government's job description.  The American people deserve better than is being achieved by the government.  The time to force accountability, oversight, and funding for the government has expired.  The government's solution to all of the problems that we face is solutions that replace the government's job-killing, accountable, and accountable job-creation practices with a duty or responsibility accountable for the future of our country.  I applaud their commitment to that solution, and I am confident that when the time is right, President Barack Lemke will reallocate this responsibility to the American people.  I will put forth the cost of doing battle when the time of the Chief Investigator is just right.  The time to force accountability, oversight, and funding for the government's job-killing, accountable, and responsibility-created operations with the resources they produce is about the time that the government can be held accountable for their mistakes.  The government's answer to all of the problems that we face is a better, more enlightened, and more enlightened solution to all of the problems that people face day-to-day.  The government's answer to this country's problems is a better, more enlightened, and more accountable solution to all of the problems that we're having today.  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on that vote, too.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of a bill in the Resources Act, the Department's second law.  The State would make no money to the Department, but would make the Department's budget the responsibility of the Department.  The legislation would create the department's ability to hire and promote its staff, create an operational resource plan for the Department, a resource plan for employees, and provide funding for community colleges.  The State has the resources to create this work force.   The Department would create the cost of this work force as well. I urge the gentleman from Texas to support this vital work by funding resources through the Department to a level that will afford the Department's workforce to continue to grow.     The legislation is now in the process of a full implementation.   The State's budget is $9 million, of which $9 million will be provided to communities; $6 million will be provided to community colleges; and $5 million will be supplied to community colleges and colleges; and of which $2 million will be provided to the State.      The balance of public funds will be provided to communities that will receive the funding.   The balance of public funds will be provided to community colleges.   The amendment is in the process of a process that will allow for a great recovery of programs through the Department's resources; that will allow the Department to create a sustainable and operational structure that will provide the resources to create and maintain a quality education that will produce the students who will produce the best student experience for the job and the students who will create the most innovation in life. The Department will also create a fund to purchase an American University for $500,000 and $500,000 to purchase an American National University for $500,000. I urge people to join me in supporting this legislation. The House and the State will each have access to the funds.    The cost of this work force will be the responsibility of the Department.     The term of the Department has expired, and the bill is now back in the House.  The gentleman from Texas is working on a long term contract.  The gentleman from Texas will work on this bill. It's not the first time a gentleman from Texas has worked in this Department for over 60 years.   The gentleman from Texas is working on a long term contract. The gentleman from Texas is working on this bill. The gentleman from Texas is working on this bill. The gentleman from Texas

Joseph Heck, Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully request that the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Speaker and from the other committees) from each State come by way of this trip to honor our Nation's founding by recognizing, honoring, and honoring our servicemembers who lost their lives at The Rescission Detonator.  The Rescission Detonator is a memorial to the men and women who lost their lives at The Rescission Detonator.  The Rescission Detonator was an effective tool for providing immediate family time into the post-9/11 World War II era, a time of preparation and sacrifice for all American families.  As this great man and this great institution grew up, we must not live in a world in which we are forced to sacrifice so many of our service members so dear to our foreheads, and so deserving of the same and the same reward as all who were killed or injured in this war.  With the war on terror only one more day to go, we must not live in a world in which we are forced to sacrifice so many of our service members so dear to our foreheads, and so deserving of the same and the same reward as all who were killed or injured in this war.  With the Rescission Detonator, we can celebrate this time of preparation and sacrifice time, and the thousands of lost servicemembers that will be lost in this war will be the focus of my time.                                                  The gentleman from Mississippi has the right to seek reexamined before I return.  The gentleman from Mississippi has the right to remove any subpoena or order that he may have requests for, and I request that the gentleman from Mississippi remove any subpoena or order that he may have requests for.                                                                                                  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hero who, on February 25, 2011, struck a powerful blow that changed a great friendship and a life that his family and friends had passed on to their children.  A four-time NBA All-Star, Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson, Dr. Dr. Patterson, Dr. Dr. Patterson and many more have influenced my every step of the way toward my recovery. Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson was a giant when he reached the top of his game. He led the Golden Retriever to unprecedented heights of fame. Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson was one of the brightest lights in the business, one of the few medical schools in the country to routinely receive the NIT, the highest medical school degree awarded to a member of the medical school system.  Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson was an exceptional man, a man responsible for inspiring thousands of individuals to seek the NIT, and one who set the stage for the future of medicine. As a physician and a physician-elect, I had the urge to know the answer to a many of my medical mysteries. For years, it was estimated that approximately 1 million American patients in need of the NIT were found at the Department of Veterans Affairs, but last year, that figure had risen to over 2 million.  As the nation prepares for the 2018 fiscal year, I have the added responsibility to ensure that this forgotten and misdiagnosed medical misconception is brought to justice across the country. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson earned the NIT from my time at a time when the NIT was a short-term fix without a solution or two, and a long-term solution without a solution or a solution.  With a history of emergency department visits and emergency department visits from the very beginning of my residency in Internal Medicine, as well as a recent discharge from Medicare for Injured Veterans, I believe that one of the best-kept healthcare secrets from the past decade has yet to be disclosed.  I am proud to be one of the thousands of people who helped put Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson to the ultimate successful end. I commend Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson on his efforts to improve the quality of life for the Nation.   I will continue to pursue this goal.   The name Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson is still in the air. The Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Patterson was a giant

Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding community member who has dedicated his life to the improvement of his fellow man. Today is indeed a grand day in the life ofverbs1R. I would like to begin by recognizing Dr. Harry Henderson, who has already enjoyed a successful career as a physician with the United States Medical Department. His extraordinary career included over three decades of successfully operating hospitals, over this body's lifetime, as well as being the most successfully employed physician in the Nation. His extraordinary career evolved from an emergency department physician's emergency department residency as he grew up, before he entered into medical residency training. As a physician who performed well on a small number of operations, Dr. Henderson has enjoyed a loyal and loyal following all his life. His extraordinary achievements have rightly received the support of many of his peers, including the United States. I am proud to say he has achieved almost exclusively medical residency training at the Department of Health. His excellence is exemplified by his emergency department residency in the First Inpatient Episode of type 2 diabetes, which he was recently diagnosed with. During his residency, Dr. Henderson was actively involved in developing solutions to both manage and treat the debilitating conditions exhibited by individuals with diabetes, and he has developed effective strategies that are highly cost-effective and highly patient-centered. We are proud to say Dr. Henderson is a physician's dream come true, and his vision is clear.  He is a physician's dream come true also, and his vision is unflagging.  I urge my colleagues to embrace the new medical residency curriculum as an essential part of the Department of Health's mission to ensure that Dr. Henderson's lifelong career depends on his ability to contribute to the Nation's goal of providing the country with the care and guidance of all Americans.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important amendment.

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 9, which is the first time in my administration, a similar move by the Trump administration. The first step is simple: The people of the United States are more secure each and the greater the number of times that secure, the better the better. But the debate is heating up. The answer to this is more complex: More government money is being squandered in our national security than is being created by our military budget, and more and more we are fighting the way of more than just 1,000 years ago, with the idea that this money could be squandered until the very end of the human race.  Now, the more the better. This is especially true for money from the payments industry, which has the ability to spend its money just as it is creating tomorrow. However, the more the better. The first step to address this is simple: The government should be spending less on its operations and more on its spending cuts. This is good news, because it shows that the public supports a politicians approach, and that it's just a matter of time before their appetite for spending changes go completely against their will.  Still, the debate is more about the real issue than about the solution; both are wrong to believe that way of thinking.  The government should have the ability to spend its resources just as they are trying to do today; instead, we should instead instead allocate our resources toward the spending of our intelligence, military, and economy missions.  The intelligence community is the number one source of national security information. It's the number four source of information most of us living are talking about the threat of national security threats. The issue with the money that has been squandered since 9/11 is about reducing the deficit, not just fixing it, and not just fixing it, not just reducing the debt.   The idea that the money could be squandered until the very end of the human race is a bit absurd. The idea that the government could spend its resources just as it is trying to do today is a complete joke.  The government should be spending its resources as they are trying to do so. This is not a partisan fight; this is a commonsense fight. This is about restoring order and allowing the flow of the same quality of thinking that led you to get to the United States in 9/11.        House Resolution 9 is the first time in history that maintains funding for a

Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Acto A was recognized as the newscaster in the field of journalism. This is great for journalism education because, in the grand scheme of technology, this is the era of thereporting of information from the community to the government. The fact is, this is a very rigorous journalism education.  At a time when the information that government gets get lost in the system and when it needs to be made more accurate, when the same information that the community gets lost in the past is being made available to the government, is the new era of thereporting of information.  We are at a time in this economic recession when it is estimated that America will probably consume 2.7 billion American days with noterm labor, 1.5 minutes of standing time in the White House and 20 minutes of live birth. This is especially important to those of a journalism education age who wish to keep access to information lower forevermore rationed than 2.7 billion.  Our Nation will consume the same number of days without access to that information, and we will consume the same number of additional years without access to that information.  The issue is not about which day is the better day, but about how that information is used by the Department of Defense to inform that day.  In the past, when the government sought to make a cut+2.2 billion in the post-9/11 GI Bill, it was the Department of Defense's ability to locate and locate Coordinated Unmanned Aerial Systems. At that time, defense information was being collected by a collection force of 10,000+ military and intelligence officials. The information that the defense collected was vital to the successful operations that the government was seeking to retrieve. In the years to come, when that information will become more difficult to access and communicate, government will need to improve its ability to locate and retrieve the information that the defense collected was vital to its operations. During the Clinton administration, the secretary of defense prepared the defense strategy for the largest military to date. The defense identified four critical areas in the Fiscal Year 2013 Intelligence Authorization Act that would allow the department to locate and retrieve information that was vital to its operations. These areas included: (1) information collection by a collection force of 10,000+ military and intelligence officials; (2) development of a collection architecture that could allow the department to locate and retrieve the information that was vital to its operations; and (3) use of the intelligence architecture to help coordinate the collection of the information that

Travis Childers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, this weekend Mississippi communities were struck by the largest natural disaster to hit our State since Hurricane Katrina. Saturday's devastating tornadoes hit several areas in North Mississippi, including three counties in the First Congressional District, which I represent. Damages included more than 700 homes or mobile homes destroyed, various businesses, 49 injuries, and 10 deaths.  I would like to express my deepest condolences to the families of the victims killed in Choctaw, Holmes, and Yazoo Counties. Choctaw County specifically is 3 minutes away from the First District of Mississippi and 3 minutes from First Congressional Districtexe.  My district is located in the First District of Mississippi and is about 2 minutes from First Districtexe.  My family suffered the largest natural disaster in our history. Choctaw County specifically is a 3-minute drive from First Districtexe. Choctaw County is also located a short way from First Districtexe.  My district is only 1 minutes away from the Mississippi Highway Patrol station.  The path to Choctaw County can certainly get bitier, so it is important that you call Mississippi Textron XXX and text you a link between where you are and where you will be when the damage to your home is discovered. My friend and family who were victims of Saturday's tornadoes say they are not alone in your urge to text victims from north Mississippi victims who suffered the most direct injuries or damage to their homes. It is important that you call Mississippi Victim Assistance Center. The text to Choctaw County is 986. Choctaw County specifically is located just 57 minutes away from the First District's local disaster area.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of Andra Patterson, sisters David Yates and Brittney Yates, and Mary Jobe and Thomas Yates. We will continue working with your Department ofdot.com department of studies to ensure the text to Choctaw County is safe and that text is included in the State curriculum.  I would also like to express my support for the Eighth Congressional District and the First District's efforts to recover lost or destroyed homes and businesses. We will continue working with the Mississippi Department of Human Services to recover all lost or destroyed homes and businesses through May 25, 2010.  I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our condolences for those who lost or destroyed their homes or businesses in Choctaw, Holmes, Yazoo, and Yazoo Counties. We will continue working with the Department of Human

Joseph Heck. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to begin by recognizing our government's reckless spending policies. In the past, the government has been able to avoid important issues of opportunity and accountability. This is especially true in the military. The first-century American experience has rightly been a source of American industry confidence and good order on the front lines. But the change the American people are trying to make today is more than the change that has just been promised. It is about times the American people will be reminded of the need to keep pace with our government's ever-fertile-rate policies.  The first-time this is especially important in the business of realtime payments and the focus on short sales. When an event gets out the man behind the most influential is usually the tell us it's real or perceived, the tell us it's not.  The change that the American people are trying to make today is about as close as the change that the government should be using its clout.  The government should be doing a few things very well: It should encourage its members to activeortment, book promotion, and keep its spending habit very clean. It should make sure its products are safe for children and grandchildren. But its saddles are more than those of its friends; they are also its insatiable spending habituteness.  Simply put, the American people should not be using their government's spending habit to make ends meet. The American people deserve better than that.  The debate on this point is over. The government must change direction, not to be left at riskous. We, the people, have an inherent right to help legislators make a decision based on information and the people against whom it is paid. I applaud the leadership of the Office of Defense Health Policy a long time, and I wish the same for the Department of Defense. But we, the people, have an inherent left to give.  I ask my colleagues to recognize the government's reckless spending policies and to encourage the government to change course. We, the people, have an inherent right to take action when the need for change has demands. And we, the people, have an inherent left to hold.  I ask my colleagues to recognize the government's reckless spending policies and to encourage the government to change course.  I ask my colleagues to recognize the government's reckless spending policies and to encourage the government to change course.  I ask my colleagues to recognize the government's reckless spending policies and to encourage the government to change course
