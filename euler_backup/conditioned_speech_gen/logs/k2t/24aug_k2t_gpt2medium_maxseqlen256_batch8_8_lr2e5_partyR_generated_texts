THE WILKES-BARRE, Mich. (WOOD) -- Five days of demonstrations have left downtown Wilkes-Barre police officers shaken and angry over what they say were unfair tactics used against protesters and the aggressive nature of some of their officers.

There are 10 police officers from Wilkes-Barre Regional Medical Center in Dearborn on sick leave, as well as two city employees at Wilkes-Barre Police Services.

"These are police officers who worked overtime all weekend to try to make sure we had a peaceful protest in a peaceful area," said Matt Johnson of the Coalition for Justice Against Police Brutality. "You can't expect police officers to come up with a plan if there's no law, no orders."

Johnson is part of a group of community activists calling for the resignation of all 15 officers who participated in the rally outside the courthouse, which had gathered at 11 p.m. Sunday. Protesters had called the event to protest police misconduct.

He said while he didn't realize what he was facing Sunday night, as soon as he stepped inside, he saw officers dressed in riot gear -- and with guns -- marching on protestors, chanting, "Stand your ground!" and "Shoot first!"

am pleased to announce that on November 17, 1996, Senator Robert Kennedy, the Democratic leader, will be nominated by President Clinton for an unexpired term. Following the nomination, Senator Kennedy will take over the Senate Democratic leadership in the Senate. He will have the honor of serving as the Senate Democratic leader for a 5 year term.  Senator Kennedy has served in the Senate for 13 years as the majority leader, a tenure in which he was able to advance and pass some important legislation, and a close relationship to his colleagues. It has been my honor to have known and helped with many of these issues over the years. I appreciate the opportunity to serve with him.  I thank Senator Kennedy for his great efforts on behalf of Senator Lugar and Senator Hutchison, who both I consider to be Senators I will consider for the remainder of my life, as well as the work of the committee which will administer the important appropriations process. He has been a very efficient leader who has made important contributions to both parties.  I also want to thank my colleagues for their help and contributions during the past decade. They have not only protected us from the whims of the majority leader, but also for the hardworking work of working legislators on the other side of the aisle. I am very

 Senator, last night on the floor, the gentleman from Arizona, who's a Republican, a great leader and a fine gentleman, was in the Chamber with a few of his staffs who were on their way to a State of the Union meeting. We had them up there talking about all the people who were coming in, what the Democrat agenda would be, when they would actually be here and how we're trying to move this Congress in the right direction. We went in, and he was looking up at the Senate, and there was the President of the United States. He had spoken and he had taken some time out of his schedule to look at the debate in the Senate and the progress in the Senate.  The President said, ``I heard your voice. We are going to start a Republican majority in this body.'' He did it, and there were eight Senators and two or three of the freshmen who would be the new majority, and it was quite remarkable to watch. There were 18 Democratic-held seats. Democrats controlled both the Senate and the House and Congress. So they were able to control the Senate by a vote of 54 to 41. That was not a Republican majority. We were voting on a Democratic bill that would have put the Democrats in charge,

Republican leaders have offered the House's amendment in a compromise with the Senate this week. We worked with both the Senate and the White House on an amendment. It is designed to allow for the consideration of amendments to the bill that have been brought to the floor before. We have worked hard with the minority to get the amendments that have been brought to the floor expeditiously to be made available for debate.  This week, we have a motion to recommit our bill, H.R. 3077, to the House floor. It is our intention to work with the Senate to accommodate the demands of the minority as they consider these amendments. We intend to work in the minority, with the minority leader, to reach an agreement as to how we should address the amendments to the bill in order to enable debate on the amendments before the Senate.  We would encourage the minority and the Senate to meet at 12:30 tomorrow and proceed to work toward a bill that works for everyone.

If you want to know what I was thinking, the last Republican leader who was here the last day, I went from the White House in January when the Speaker was in the White House, to the Senate, to the Senate, to the House, and back again, in April, and I got a letter from the Speaker saying we are going to move ahead with the President's health care bill.  Well, I am pretty sure the majority leader was not going to move ahead with the President's health care bill because, in the last few days, the Democrats have made their case to the American people that their health care bill has changed dramatically, that the Republicans' bill has not changed dramatically, that the Democrat proposal has not changed dramatically, and that the Democrats' plan is a disaster. They call it a giant job-killing bill, they call it a free-market system, they call it a government-run

In the last few months we are seeing more and more of these incursions of Burmese people. We have heard some of the stories from Burma about the military thugs being sent to Burma. We have heard from people here in the United States that it is happening in California as well. This is just an opportunity for the United Nations to be sending some kind of peacekeeping force to Burma, and they are doing it. There is a U.N. team now in Burma. In the last year or so, it has been held as some kind of a peacekeeping mission.  The U.N. has, in the past, supported a number of peacekeeping efforts against Burma.

PATRICK LAUTEN, a public school teacher and the president of the National Association for the Deaf in New York City, was on Capitol Hill on Friday afternoon for a hearing on H.R. 1588, a bill that would strike part of ObamaCare. The legislation would eliminate and replace the health care system's employer mandates with a ``consistent, reasonable, and balanced'' system of health care.  Mr. Lausten is the author of the bill called the ``Fair Pricing Act of 2009.'' In fact, the bill is sponsored by a member of the Republican conference. He says the Fair Price Act would be the same one that Congress has passed into law on July 19, 2009. He said the bill would require that the government take a hard look at the way the health insurance program currently operates. He says one way that the government could change health care is if it required companies to cover their employees with health care insurance provided by the Federal Government.  Mr. Lausten also said he hopes the Government-run health care system could be replaced by an insurance program that the government could create its own system.

In a hearing before the House Agriculture Committee last week, I tried to illustrate exactly why Congress is considering a farm bill on Tuesday and why we need a bill that would lower the cost of grain and food to the American people. It is a good example of why the American people are for a farm bill--it would provide relief to farmers across the country, and we know that the price of grains and grains products are hurting American consumers.  I heard from a farmer, Rick, in Alabama. The price of bread, rice, meat, and vegetables--all of them--are significantly higher today than they were 4 years ago when the Agriculture Committee approved the farm bill. There was some $1 billion in savings in these crops--in a report that was issued just yesterday by the USDA. But the cost of food and grains is still too high.  It's not only about this farm bill. As you heard from Rick, one of the concerns that has been raised, particularly over the last few weeks, from a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans who have been pushing for a farm bill and a farm bill that would give relief to producers and consumers is that we are going to be imposing a tax of $400 billion--$400 billion--and that is the biggest tax
