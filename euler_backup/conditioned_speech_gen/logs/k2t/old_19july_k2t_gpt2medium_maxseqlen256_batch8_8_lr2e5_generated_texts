If you're like me, you've always wondered what it would be like to live in a world that doesn't have to rely on fossil fuels.

But if you're like me, you've always wondered what it would be like to live in a world that doesn't have to rely on fossil fuels.

That's why I'm so excited to announce that we're teaming up with one of the world's largest energy companies to create a new kind of energy that doesn't rely on fossil fuels.

It's called renewable energy.

Renewable energy is energy that doesn't rely on fossil fuels.

This question was originally posted to Ask A Mormon. It has been edited to clarify some of the important wording.

Q: If I am a missionary and find myself speaking about Jesus, I do not know whether this is a part of our church teachings. Should we always put them into context for our audience? Or is there room for exceptions?

A: This question comes up frequently with LDS missionaries. That is because they are on a mission. As such, you have the benefit of church scriptures, but it's up to you to decide what the context is for that and what the intent of those scriptures is. Again, a few things to consider:

The context here is that Jesus appeared in person. Since this is just about him, then Jesus must be understood as part of the church's teachings. If there is a mistake in your interpretations, the situation could be a little more complicated. Here are some situations where the Savior's appearance could make sense:

The scriptures teach that Jesus' teachings are about God (1 Tim. 1:1-3; 1 Peter 1:1-9). Jesus talked with people about the purpose of creation and the relationship of a father and son.

 It has nothing to do with Russia. This is a bipartisan measure.  But, last summer, Russia put up a $400 million fund to help buy a missile system that it could not use because of sanctions.  This is a legitimate investment that would, once again, allow the United States to respond to a serious crisis in a way that we can and should do, and our intelligence community can do it responsibly and effectively.  I have to say that we all think that this is a very prudent and responsible policy. We are going to get tougher on Russia, but we should be able to do so with the kind of intelligence that we have.

A/N: What have you been reading lately?

Well, as a note on pacing I just wanted to let you guys know that the story is actually not exactly what you think it is. This was supposed to be a two parter, but with a second chapter taking much of this thing's time and attention. It was just too full and it didn't make a whole lot of sense. So I thought I should get rid of it, but since it wasn't really any good, I decided I'd give it another chance as a second parter. It's still the same thing as I'm telling it now, so keep that in mind. I wanted to write this story in an old fashioned style, as opposed to how things are usually told nowadays. That's basically the process.

I hope you guys like the story. It's not perfect, but I guess the point of it is to tell you guys one story in a small format. My main character is an ex-cop in New Mexico who has since taken a job as a cop for hire. His new job is mostly doing traffic work and working with people who look like he does not look very much like you guys, but who seem to be incredibly kind and nice and very

There's plenty of good things to say about this book. One is that it's not just a book about eating: the author has put together a wonderful, interactive, and engaging book on exercise that is about eating. It's also not about eating, the way the book is told, because the author clearly knows what he wants to say about exercise — and a bit more of that than the typical author would like to admit. I wouldn't say it's a shallow, boring book, but it's not as exciting as the ones that come out of books about exercise, either. My main takeaway from this book is that exercise isn't a simple matter of eating — it involves eating, and exercise isn't about eating — it's about exercise in all kinds of ways that include eating, like getting enough sleep and managing stress, and even eating food that isn't from the foods in your cupboard. When you get to know this book, I recommend it to people with an interest in being active and staying active — and who don't want to hear about the latest fitness craze. It's definitely a book that could stand on its own merit, but it's even worth reading alongside the classics in this market. —Mark E.

Maggie is a character from the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. She is a black bear, with brown fur, a big belly and big red ears. She is shown to be very good at animal companionship, being very affectionate and loyal.

In the film, Maggie was brought back to life by the sorceress Belle after Belle sacrificed herself and the boy her father had left as a pet. She later lived and worked with Belle for four years before she was sent to the Forest of the Sleeping Beauty by Esmé de Blois, where she was captured by King Arthur. As she was on the run, her husband, Captain Hook, also tried to free her. However, Maggie got the idea to make peace with her, and the two agreed to have a child to help out the forest where she was missing. At the last minute, they were married, though the child would be very much a child of the forest, because of how difficult it is to make new homes for the creatures, and the forest is a hard place to live in.

Maggie is a big fan of Belle. In the song "Let Me Be a Little More Like You" the songwriters say that she is a Disney character who would like

 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 790, the Child Abuse Victims and Custodians Relief Act of 1994. This legislation will provide relief to families, victims, and caregivers of children who have been abused or neglected or who are underadjudged by the courts.  In these very difficult economic times, millions of families are struggling to provide for their children and must fund the very expensive legal procedures and costs associated with these children's abuse. The Child Abuse Survivors and Children of America, and H.R. 790 would address the challenges that families face when they attempt to seek help and seek help for their child's abuse victim or caretaker. This legislation will provide a legal avenue for families to seek help from the courts when courts, underfunded, are not able to grant such relief to families.  Currently, thousands of people depend on the courts to ensure their children are safe and their abusers are held accountable. This bill would help ensure that justice can be served in the courts.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 790. I have long been a strong supporter of the Children's Defense Act and H.R. 1706, and I want to commend Congressman James F. Taylor, a member of

 I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for bringing this bill to our attention. This was a major issue of the administration of the last administration, one of many challenges that were faced by the men and women of this Department and of the Department of Defense, but it is really quite remarkable. There were issues that had to do with the integrity and effectiveness of the U.S. military, and I think that it is an issue that has to do with the ethics and honesty of the military, and it is interesting to realize, too, that I'm a proud member of the Republican delegation to the Senate who has a policy that requires the integrity of the military, and I was a proud member of the Republican minority who did not support the war in Iraq. We had a bill that was put forward that would have guaranteed that the next administration would not have been tempted to continue the war in Iraq, and, actually, at the time I voted for it, the reason I supported it was I thought it was too important to not be able to trust the integrity of the military. This is an extraordinary legislation, but we must be honest with our servicemembers and with our Department of Defense.

 Madam Speaker, I am here to honor the memory of the courageous police officer who was killed in the line of duty at the height of the tragedy at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, NV.  A member of the police department's Internal Affairs Division, Sergeant Jeffrey M. Jones was attacked in the parking lot of the Route 91 Music Festival on Sunday, October 1.  Mr. Jones, 25, of the Northbrook neighborhood of Chicago, was a proud graduate of Northbrook High School and graduated from the Chicago Police Department in 2015.  He was married with a wife of 11 years and a daughter, who is still in high school. He was active in the community, volunteering at his church and a local club.  Sergeant Jones, who had been attending the festival with his wife and daughter, was on a mission, as he loved being a police officer.  But he was going from good to better, as the shooting took his life.  He leaves behind four daughters, including three daughters, one of whom is a 9-year-old.  As he said at a news conference, Sergeant Jones was one of those brave officers who showed the world the best that Chicago has to offer.  I want you to remember Sergeant Jones.

 Mr. President, the bill before the Senate would not just allow people who suffer from Alzheimer's disease and other serious brain diseases to go to nursing homes without having to be on their medication. This is much simpler than what happened in 2007.  As Republicans know, there is very little evidence that Alzheimer's disease is linked to nursing homes. There is no evidence, for instance, that Alzheimer's affects women more often than men. There is no evidence that it affects patients younger than 65. There is no evidence that nursing homes--because they are already the largest part of the economy for seniors--will become hospitable to senior citizens.  Mr. President, the bill would create nursing homes. No one wants to buy a nursing home. They don't have any incentive to do that. So the bill would make it a State-licensed facility and the State would pay the people in the nursing homes. The State would pay the nursing home where it will have full social and economic support for the nursing residents and provide the mental health services and care services that people need in their nursing homes. It would allow people with Alzheimer's disease and other serious problems to go home for a few months to be in care, not necessarily to stay in a nursing home, but, instead,

H.R. 3054 also contains reforms to improve the current program, making it more effective and less costly.  But this bill also provides important stability by repealing the individual mandate for 2018, which will be the first time in 60 years that Congress has repealed the requirement that all Americans purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ensure that our constituents get access to affordable flood insurance.

 The chairman and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee have identified these nominees to be judges of the courts in the district court of the United States. They have determined they are to be nonvoting Members of the Senate. That is the reason. We have the responsibility. And the court is not a single Member, but they are representing the United States of America. They are representing the citizens of the United States.  The Republican leader has said, and I am not going to repeat this, the President will nominate judges. The Democrats have said, in the past, they will not confirm judges. The President will nominate judges. The President will appoint judges. If we defeat the majority's resolution on the motion to proceed to H.R. 686, as it is called by some people, this Senate will confirm the judges they have nominated.  There is nothing they could do to stop this, to keep it from happening, to have a filibuster. It is a matter of public record that, if you were to vote for it and you were to be elected to this body, you will be voted into the same office. In my opinion, this is a violation of the Constitution, of precedent, and of what the American people expect.

 Mr. President, as many of my colleagues will be aware, I have been working to resolve a major concern in the transportation security bill. This issue relates to the Federal Aviation Administration's plans for changes to the airport security and security checkpoints. Unfortunately, despite our good intentions, Congress has not been able to reach an agreement on changes.  The proposed changes include the following:  Redesignations of six perimeter pathing gates, two in airports, and two more in major hub airports.  New security officers to be trained for the new checkpoint checkpoints.  The addition of the National Transportation Security Officers, TSA, to the training program.  A redesign of the physical security screening checkpoints and screening equipment that will be in place when the new checkpoints are constructed.  Additional money to enable the Transportation Security Administration to meet TSA budget goals.  Changes to aviation security screening to cover higher frequency passenger air travel.  Further changes to airport pathing locations to provide for increased security at over 300 airports.  Additional time to resolve the issue.  I support the proposal by the Senate to make improvements to aviation security and require the FAA to report to Congress on its plans. However, the bill does not take any additional steps to protect our aviation security.  Further, the bill

As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I think it is critical that we continue to invest in the Navy, the Air Force, and our men and women in uniform.  I have strong opinions on the NDAA, but I think we have learned some important lessons. I believe that we should be making sure that our men and women in uniform are provided the best possible care.

 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the President's health care reform law is now a reality. It is the product of the hard work of a broad and bipartisan consensus in this Chamber and across the country. The law protects individuals' health care, and I will keep the American people and, indeed, our planet in my mind's eye and focus on that aspect of health care reform.  But we must make sure that this law is a victory for the American people. When a new day arrives, there are still plenty of questions about health care reform. We are a country of many big promises. What will it mean to your children and grandchildren? What benefits will they receive from their government-funded programs? We are the most powerful country on Earth, and we can only make promises based on the facts.  Today is a good day for Americans who have been waiting long enough for reform. The law is working for them. It is making sure that they can get affordable health insurance, and it is encouraging innovation to come out of the health care field. I congratulate President Obama for his accomplishment.

 Mr. President, this year marks 100 years since the United States entered World War I. This war in the Pacific was the bloodiest war in American history. It lasted for just over a year and began in December of 1917, and it ended in March of 1918. This is a war for the survival of our Nation.  For 100 years, all Americans have been assured of their freedom. In 1917, a small group of patriots met in Washington, DC, and voted for freedom. They said: ``Our hearts go out to those oppressed nations who were ever after to be free, if only so they could live a free life.''  That sentiment has carried into this century, and it has been repeated year after year, even more times than it has over the past century. We have the obligation and the responsibility to continue our mission to end slavery, to bring peace to the world, and to maintain the peace that exists today and the lasting peace that we hope to see for our children and grandchildren.  Since World War I, the United States has led the world in economic development and humanitarian progress.

 Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I just want to make two points.  First, the Democrats in the House and the Senate are the only ones who have proposed a budget. The United States Government as a whole, by contrast, has had a budget for the last 18 years. It wasn't a budget that was passed out of the House or the Senate. It was a compromise.  The Democrats in the House and the Senate who are going to propose a budget now have no idea how they are going to balance the budget. They haven't read any of the details of what their plan is.

Today, we must be careful to ensure that our current economic conditions will not be repeated by future generations. However, that is not to say that we should stop trying.  Today, I am introducing the Education Opportunity Through Labor Act of 2019, which will expand and strengthen programs to encourage people to go to school to pursue higher education and training. I am also introducing the School Choice Opportunity Act of 2019, which would help ensure that children are provided with the ability to choose the best option for their lives, and specifically work opportunities.  It is no exaggeration to say that these programs can positively impact students who want to learn, especially when they are young people who will have to make sure that they are prepared for the skills needed to succeed in the future.  While many of our young people are entering higher education right now, they face the uncertainty of a low graduation rate

 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6172, the Protecting American Lungs and Reversing the Youth Tobacco Epidemic Act of 2019.  H.R. 6172 is a bipartisan bill introduced by my good friend and colleague from California (Mr. Takano), and I thank him for his hard work on this bill.

 Mr. President, I rise to honor an incredible young man, and I will be speaking later on about a great man, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who is being awarded the Medal of Honor by the U.S. Senate for her extraordinary heroism on November 9, 2009, when an armed gunman opened fire on her vehicle in the middle of a busy intersection in Minneapolis, MN.  During the course of the shooting, Senator Klobuchar's vehicle was hit four times, but the bullets didn't stop. Instead, a single bullet tore through the windshield and through the passenger side door, destroying the front passenger door as well.  The bullet, however, stopped long enough for Senator Klobuchar to grab her 4-year-old daughter and run to safety, where she saw a second vehicle hit by a car driven by the gunman, who had fired multiple rounds from his semiautomatic pistol.  After several minutes, a distraught Senator asked to be moved. A doctor began talking to her about this young man. The gunman, it turned out, had been a drug user. This doctor told Senator Klobuchar this young man had tried for weeks to get into treatment for drug addictions. It had taken him months to

 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th anniversary of The Northern Marianas Community Day, an annual event in my State of Alaska that focuses on education and preservation of the islands. This event brings together school, community, and State officials to celebrate the islands' cultural, historical, and spiritual significance to Alaska and the United States.  I am honored to recognize the Northern Marianas Community Day as Alaska's first-ever public celebration of The Northern Marianas Day in March.  The Northern Marianas Community Day offers an opportunity for Alaskans to learn about the islands and their rich history through historical accounts, educational programs, and cultural events.  Alaska's largest island and largest, Kalibo, is the largest of the Marianas and contains some 200 islands, islands that surround the mainland and lie in the North Pacific Ocean. The islands also host a variety of cultural, economic, and historic sites, including the traditional island residences of the Matsga and the traditional village of Skarlan, the first people to build a permanent settlement.  The U.S. Congress established the Northern Marianas Community Day to promote and educate about the importance of education to Alaskans. This event serves as an ongoing educational experience to raise awareness about the history of Alaska

 Mr. President, we now face the reality that we will need to vote on a so-called stimulus bill--the so-called stimulus bill, or, in fact, whatever it is we call it. We may not be able to call it a stimulus bill when we are not actually aware of how much we are spending on it, but I believe the truth is that the bill we will be voting on will be something much more than an 8.8-percent increase in our national debt. The truth is it will be the largest government spending expansion in the history of the United States of America.  What this bill is really going to do, and I don't mean to take too much of my time, I hope, Senator Kyl and I might have the chance to discuss this a little bit more. But what this bill is really going to do is it is going to expand government at the expense of the people it was designed to help. It is going to spend over $1 trillion of their hard-earned tax dollars.  Why would the government want to spend over $1 trillion of their money on health care when they know that the people who are already struggling to get health care, they are getting higher health care costs from those who get health care,

 Mr. President, if I could, I just want to say to the Senator from Massachusetts that there is nothing he said or that I said that warrants this type of vote. There are things that come before us. These bills are not something that are designed to be partisan. They are designed to help people--not create jobs, not create wealth, not hurt people, but to help people, to help people stay out of poverty, to help people get their economic security. This is not some partisan vote. There is nothing partisan about this in it.  I also want to say I would tell you--I am from Wyoming--that we do have a few good amendments on the Agriculture appropriations bill. This is not the way things are done on the Agriculture Committee. We have had about five votes over the past 30 days to try to address some of the spending in that bill. I had a couple of my colleagues on the committee say: Don't let us do what we say we want to do. They are voting against the bill anyway, I believe, on the budget.  I know the chairman and the ranking member are trying to deal with some of these things. We will try to do this in the Appropriations Committee. I am sorry.

 Mr. Speaker, this week, a week after the inauguration of President Trump, the Department of Labor published its findings on the proposed rule changes from the Obama-era rulemaking process. The results were pretty disappointing:  On average, 40 years of overtime pay had fallen by an average of $13.80 a hour.  A new 5-week overtime rule eliminated up to 75 percent of a company's average weekly salary for the first time ever.  The regulation cost $2 billion in paperwork, cost $3.3 billion to implement, and over $1 billion in economic activity in the economy.  On top of all of the above, this regulation increases the potential negative impact on millions of workers across the country.  The administration also claimed that the rule would reduce workplace injuries by up to $35 million, but we all know that's not the case.  What really happened was the American people were told it would make them less safe working or for school. Now that we know that the proposed rule will have devastating impacts on workers, it should go without saying that we have to do everything we can to preserve the livelihoods of hardworking Americans.  I have long believed that American workers should be given a voice, and I look forward to the rule

 Mr. President, I wish to speak about the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which I support. I do not believe Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed by any committee on the Executive or Judiciary Committees--not even the Select Committee on Intelligence or the Democratic side of the aisle--but they are all in the majority. There is simply no excuse for this situation.  I can't understand how anybody can vote to deny a qualified, highly qualified, and honorable judge because of his political beliefs, given how he has committed the most flagrant and reckless misconduct in the entire Senate Judiciary Committee, which we don't have the privilege of learning about.  No one who has spent a significant amount of time in the Senate can ever have an honest and correct assessment of Judge Kavanaugh. It seems that in the end, partisanship won't get you what you want. I am hoping that our Republican colleagues will not take a partisan beating in the confirmation process when it comes to Judge Kavanaugh.  Here are my concerns.  As I have said before, no one could dispute that Judge Kavanaugh, while a Harvard law professor, committed the most egregious behavior ever committed by a judge in the history of the Federal Court of Appeals for the Federal judiciary. He raped another woman and then proceeded to
