before fine-tuning
A few weeks ago, I received an email from a reader who was curious as to what I was doing with my free time. I didn't have a lot of free time, so I decided to give it a try.

I was surprised to find that I was spending a lot of time on my blog, which is a good thing.

I'm not sure how much time I actually spend on my blog, but I do spend quite a bit of time on it.

I've been doing a lot of writing lately, and I thought I'd share some of it with you.

The Australian Football League said on Tuesday that it will have to make changes to its salary structure to boost football's bottom line.

Earlier this month, the FFA said it would be looking to cap the salary cap at 50 million dollars. This means the AFL would have to cut somewhere between 15 to 20 per cent of its current salary budget.

Last year, the salary cap for the AFL was set at 14 million dollars, but in February the AFL revealed that the total number of players on its rosters had fallen from 28 million to 23 million.

The AFL will be trying to attract a wider range of talent to the sport in the short-term by increasing the amount of foreign players it places in its teams from the current 10 to 20 per cent.

In the long-term, the AFL needs to attract bigger crowds, but its priority will be to provide a better home for the sport in the community and boost membership, said a statement from the AFL.

"It will be essential that the game is played at venues close to where it's played," the statement said. "We will look to increase the availability of home grounds to attract more fans for the game. This will require the ability to develop ground infrastructure as well as training

; This was done by the Republican leader. He is a very smart man; he went from the Governor's office to the office and went straight to the floor.  I think it was not that much different, in the Senate, of what you did in the Governor's office.  I think this is a very good step forward for the people of this State, and we need to keep this in mind when we go home in November.  I am sure it has all been written. I will have more, and hopefully this can be done in a short time. I am sure this can be done. I just think the people will get behind this. We must take a long, hard look at this in this particular area.  It has been 2 days. We have been on the floor for almost 4 days. I would like to close on a couple of points and say that I think the Senator from Texas will have to come down and vote, so I hope he will not do that tomorrow.

 thank you very much, as the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. McDermott] said, I am very thankful to the gentleman for his leadership on this bill and for his leadership and friendship in working together on this bill, and for the fact that he's very good friends with the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Corrine], and we are very good friends, as is very well known, with the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Corrine], and also we were all working together on other projects.  When he left, it was just a happy end. And as he and I have talked, as is sometimes the case, we feel that we were going to make a very positive difference, and that is to bring about and to support, not only in Haiti, but also in every corner of the world.

I appreciate your support for this issue, and I have always enjoyed working with you.  I have been working on this issue with Senator Wyden and Senator Cantwell, who are both really concerned about the bill because there is the cost of the extension.  But as you know, there are a lot of other provisions in the bill that are not being addressed, and the reason is because we have not gotten the waiver and, if we get that waiver, we will move ahead with our work on this issue. And I know it is possible, and we have been asking all over the Capitol Hill, but we are hopeful we will get a waiver, and as you know, we have been working in good faith and will continue to work on this issue.  So my comments would be that, with Senator Cantwell, because of this extension, we have the opportunity to go a step further with this legislation.  I ask my colleague from Arizona if we can send this back to you and the question is to you.

I want to start by thanking my friend from Florida and the gentlelady from Arizona who has spoken in this debate. I want to thank the very talented chairman of the subcommittee, Chairman Rangel, and the chairwoman, Senator Snowe, both for making the amendment a very special thing for this Chamber.  I wanted to recognize my friend from New York, Ms. Akaka, the Democratic leader, and the people of New York and the entire nation for the very distinguished and tremendous work we have done to bring this historic bill to the floor. This bipartisan bill, which includes an important provision that reduces taxes for all filers under $150,000, is in the works. It is going to be brought to the floor for a vote next week.  The Democratic leader of this body and the gentlelady from New York are on this issue because a number of people have been working with us for more than a year, and I think, by doing this, we will get some positive results. We are starting with small business and small home buyers, homeowners, and small businesses and farmers. We are starting with working families, and also the working families of this country. It is going to be a big deal for these families who are having trouble making the

A. E. Langer, who served for many years as the Director of the New York State Department of State, wrote a letter to the Times on September 18, 2009, titled ``America's Middle Class: the Endangered Species Act's Endangered Species Act.'' In that letter he discusses the way his State's Department of State made a mistake with the Endangered Species Act. He writes: I recently visited the State Department's offices in St. Louis, Missouri. It is my expectation that the State Department will eventually complete their review of the Endangered Species Act, and, as part of that review, take up many of the various legislation related to species that we have. So it is very possible that their plans could be developed and it could take place much sooner, and we should be able to begin that very soon.  As he notes, the Endangered Species Act has been reauthorized every year since 1973. Since its reauthorization in 1970, we have never seen the number of species listed under the Act decline. Mr. Speaker, the bill has a population of more than 1,600 species, but we only receive about a half-dozen species each year.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see that this bill would allow the States

addiction counselors who, for whatever reason, are forced to perform some type of surgery or physical evaluation, and this kind of procedure or evaluation can actually cost more than the person is able to pay for it. So this is a kind of a loophole. If a person has gone into a hospital because of health conditions, they are not paying for it. If they have been on Medicaid or a Federal program, they are not paying for it.  The reality is that many of these doctors do not want to see a patient, because they know that there is a legal problem involved. So they are not willing to see the patient.  What happened when the insurance companies did not pay for this procedure? They said it was not a real procedure, that there were some problems involved. These people now cannot see a lot of their patients, and this procedure does not solve that problem.  The people who have the insurance are not happy, and they do not want this to happen. We would certainly not agree to the amendment of the gentlewoman from Washington because we know this problem.

 I do not believe that is what the Senator is talking about. What he is talking about is the bill that was just reported out that is now being discussed.

We would not have done that, at least not in the manner that Senator McConnell is suggesting.  So I don't see what the Senator is trying to do here.

My question to my colleague from Pennsylvania is, how does she explain her amendment? Why would she have to say to a child she had to leave the country or the State where she was born because the doctor would not allow her to get on an airplane that was not an air carrier, even though that doctor has to fly in the opposite direction to the country where she was born? My colleague, I will tell you, cannot think of a worse thing to do than to deny the Congress the ability of any State, any Federal agency, to provide health care for people who want it, if they have an emergency in another part of the country. It has been stated before by the President. You cannot say, ``Well, we have to get out of the country. We are going to take care of that problem for the rest of the year. It is an emergency.''  How can the Senator say, ``Well, we have to take care of that problem for the rest of the year,'' and the time is not yet here when we can say, ``We have to take care of that problem for the rest of the year because, as we know, we are working very hard to take care of the crisis that we have here.''

Curt Schilling will not return to the Red Sox following his work as a consultant for the New York Yankees.  Last month, in a Washington Post article, it was reported that Curt Schilling had a $13.5 million deal in place with the Yankees. In return, he got an interview with the Red Sox. Schilling went from being a Red Sox man to becoming an American hero, a man whose name stands for ``hero'' only in the minds of the American public, a man who was willing to stand up to a large corporation, that is, a man who is a great American, who stood up to a company in which Curt Schilling now works. He had nothing to do with the deal. He did not sign the contract until after the Yankees had won the World Series. The Yankees did not hire Curt Schilling as a consultant until after he had won the World Series.  In addition, to the great frustration of all the fans and baseball fans who see this deal as a win-win deal, Curt Schilling is now the subject of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Senator Brown, thank you for organizing this special order, and thank you for your work as ranking member of the Appropriations Committee on which you serve. It is an honor to be part of your effort here to highlight the importance of funding research at NSF's National Institute of Standards and Technology. I know that you will continue your commitment to NSF and its mission by making sure that our Nation's scientific work and discoveries are fully funded at a timely point.  This program was established in the Higher Education Act, H.R. 3058, enacted in 1990 to enable scientists and engineers, especially in the academic fields, to explore emerging areas in the fields of new research in the disciplines of math and science, applied mathematics, statistics, engineering, environmental science, and information technology.  One important aspect of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's mission is to advance knowledge about science and technology, and these kinds of programs provide important avenues for the American public to discover and utilize new scientific, technological, and engineering knowledge.  Research is essential to advancing science and technology because it is in our national interest to see advances in technology in ways that are economically, environmentally, and socially acceptable, and the research benefits that it produces are also available to the individual.
