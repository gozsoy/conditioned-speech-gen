OTTAWA -- The Liberal government says it will make it easier for Canadians to buy and sell marijuana in Canada.

Health Minister Jane Philpott announced Wednesday the government will make it easier for Canadians to buy and sell marijuana in Canada.

Philpott said the government is also looking to make it easier for Canadians to buy and sell medical marijuana.

"We want to make it easier for Canadians to buy and sell medical marijuana," Philpott told reporters.

"We're also looking to make it easier for Canadians to buy and sell recreational marijuana."

Philpott said the government will make it easier for Canadians to buy and sell recreational marijuana, which is already legal in Canada.

Noun: One who opposes the government's policy

Etymology: From the French nuit, from the Latin nunc, literally 'to oppose', from nomere 'against, oppose' + corpus 'object' (also nauta 'object').

What does this say about our politics?

The word Nuit seems to suggest something about the attitudes of our leaders – it may mean that they oppose government policy, or that they don't approve of it. However, it also seems to refer to our leaders' stance regarding certain specific aspects of the government policy.

For example, "The mayor of Paris says that he thinks there should be no change in the law." This is a different stance from that of the Prime Minister, whose words "there is no question of change" imply that this is the policy he supports.

The mayor's remarks do not necessarily mean that he has support from the leadership – it could simply mean that he doesn't agree with the way the policy is being pursued.

However, it is difficult to be sure about this for two reasons.

First, it could be that the leaders are aware of the possibility that the policy is not working as intended.

 I see that my friend is standing on the floor. I have to say I am pleased. I am very pleased that this was the bill which was on the floor when the gentleman from the South Carolina part of the original bill was brought in, which had a lot of changes and was a little more detailed, very much more thoughtful, but I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for bringing this bill to the floor.

The Honorable Frank Wolf, Jr., the former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, will be the sponsor of the Medicare-Care Improvement Act.  It is the best way to make sure Medicare-For-All can be achieved for all Americans. This bill is also a great step to end the false cost accounting that the Medicare Trust Fund will carry over until such time as we are ready to negotiate real changes.  Today, we have heard from people who are against the bill. But, Mr. President, we know that what we really need is leadership from both sides of the aisle to convince people in our party and our country that we need to pass this bill.

If you haven't seen it before, in the fall of 1995, we learned of the death of a little boy who was 6 years old at the time. We also learned of the sad case of another young man who died from what can only be described as a stroke from a drug overdose. These deaths were the death toll of the war on drugs, the death toll of the drug war, the death toll of the drug war, the death toll of drugs and addiction in the United States.  So on November 16 of this year, for the first time since 1993, we passed the Drug Take Back Day. It is that very same day we held a candlelight vigil to remember and pray for a life that is gone. And so today, I wish to bring to the attention of our colleagues of the Senate that on November 16 of this year, we passed the drug Take Back Day. We passed the drug Take Back Day because, you know, the death of an innocent child, a man, a small boy, a 13-year-old boy, a young man is a tragic and tragic death. And as our Nation mourns that loss, as our Nation mourns that tragedy, we are not going to forget or forget because of the lack of drug enforcement

,Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to support H.R. 4, a bill to expand access to health insurance coverage for all Americans.  Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, millions of people have gained access to health insurance through the Federal Health Care Act, and we must continue to ensure that as many Americans as possible have access to a secure plan.  We can't afford to lose coverage for all Americans, but that doesn't mean we can't extend health insurance coverage to all Americans. And what this bill does to make sure all Americans are included, particularly for low-income and elderly citizens, is significant.  It requires companies that have reached the size and number of employees and those selling individual policies in most States to be able to provide a plan that covers at least 20 percent of the basic benefits coverage. It establishes a requirement for the State to increase the minimum cost of insurance coverage for small employers by $500 per employee, and that no insurance plans in a State will be able to charge workers more than 20 percent of the benefit, regardless of age.  The increase in premiums and deductibles in this new law will ensure that health insurance coverage is affordable for individuals, and I believe that as more Americans have health insurance coverage today

I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in a special ceremony this weekend to honor and remember the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the lives they touched.  Since its tragic day in Newtown, CT, the victims of this tragedy have been remembered through our hearts and our prayers. It has become a daily reality that Americans should never have to live with the sorrow they felt on October 14th, 2012.  These young people and their families mourn their loss. They mourn their loss of life and their loss of loved ones. These families and their loved ones have their stories, but also know that the people who mourn them are too afraid to let the memories of the terrible day behind them overwhelm their grief.  These families and their loved ones are looking forward to more. They are hopeful that if they know they will be able to come back, they will never forget. They have been waiting all year. It is with great relief that we can share with them that in the days and weeks to come, they will be able to bring more of their hopes for a brighter tomorrow into reality.  I am hopeful that our families can move on with their lives, for they will begin to live with the burden of this terrible tragedy on their minds. I thank them

 Senator, the Senator from Oregon is right; it seems to me that all this amendment does is that, when it comes to spending of money for tax cuts, we can have the ``all of the above'' all the time; we can talk about all the programs and things that we are giving more money to; we can spend more money on tax cuts in this regard; we can have the debate that all of this ought to be all about, but what we will not do is to have the debate, instead, of what we do with the funds we have, which includes tax cuts. I think what we are getting in this bill that the Senator is so concerned about is that the tax cuts in the bill do not go to the very wealthy. The tax cuts in this bill go to the very rich.  Now, what is the difference? The first thing is that we do not have the estate tax increase. The second thing is that this is money that the rich have, and it is money that the rich can make and get back for the people who are now working for them. We do not have that as we have it now.  I would be glad to take the tax cut to that extent. I do not know if the majority leader would accept

Chairman, this amendment would deny the President of the United States the ability to increase the use of civilian employees in the Department of the Army.  Just last week, I had the privilege of touring Iraq. It was an important and a fascinating experience for me to see the people who served in the military and to see how they have gotten along. We have spent an awful lot of time and we have put a lot of blood and sweat, but this amendment is just so wrong.  The people who serve in the military, and I am not talking about civilian employees, we are talking about soldiers, who wear the uniform and that they wear our colors to keep our peacekeeping. That is a job that many people do and that they do so successfully and have been successful. That is what makes it a great military.  The same thing is true for civilians in our military. Those people are good, good soldiers, but they also are civilians, and they need civilian support in the job and our system of government.  We all know that when the United States Army is threatened or threatened to be threatened or threatened by someone else that our soldiers work hard for the government, to keep our country secure, and that is a job well performed.

As a member of the Judiciary Committee, and on the House Committee on the Judiciary, I am very concerned about the issue of immigration and this bill which, of course, is part of the so-called reauthorization of the immigration bill that the Speaker and the majority leader have sent over to the President. In fact, the Republican leadership is working to try to have this bill passed and to send it over. In fact, Mr. President, that is the intention of the majority leader.  But to say that this bill is simply amnesty is absolutely ludicrous. A majority of the Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate have voted to hold this bill to a bare minimum, which is what it is. It is virtually nothing. I have introduced an amendment to this bill, which is the same amendment that I offered last year, with my bipartisan staff, which says simply that this bill is nothing.

S. 645, a bill to amend the United States Code to extend the life of the National Security Act, includes an extension of the authority for the President to waive section 904(f) of the Act of September 30, 1972. This is not a partisan issue. Many Members of Congress have strong feelings on the issue of Section 904(f), and we have tried to be fair in allowing the President to waive the statutory requirement for such an extension.  The extension of section 904(f) to permit the President to waive this section was signed into law in 1975. A decade ago, the American Legion and the American Trade Association strongly urged the administration to extend the statutory provision. Congress has finally passed the bill.  It is instructive to look at the history of section 904(f) before passing it. Section 904(f) was adopted at the close of the Korean war. The provision was intended to allow the President to postpone, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, the acquisition of U.S. national defense articles until the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on Security Council Resolutions [UNSCR] of 1947.

There is a whole series of reasons why I am not really in favor of what this piece of legislation does. One of the reasons is that the Democratic leadership of the Congress of the United States of America is not as strong as it should be. I think the American people need a little more convincing that they are going to get their money's worth. And that is what this legislation is all about.  The other reason is because I think the Democratic leadership of this Congress, the majority party in the Congress of the United States of America, is too weak, too incompetent, too irresponsible, and too corrupt to get its job done. But it is hard to look at the other side of this story. But the most important thing, the very good thing, about this legislation, it does not do what the Democrats promised to do. There will be no more bailouts for Wall Street companies, or the Republican leadership promised to do in 2008, and this legislation is not doing that.  This is a bill that does not do what Wall Street promised it would do. It is a bill that provides real relief to hardworking people in the middle of the financial crisis, but it is not doing something that actually does something for the middle class or for families on Wall Street.

House Republicans have introduced legislation that takes two important steps to help American families, one of which is tax relief for middle-income families. Today we will do this for American families.  In particular, House Republicans have an amendment in their tax bill that is intended to do just that. That amendment will restore $200 million for an incentive program that encourages investment, returns and returns for American families.  As we have said before, this is about America's middle-class families, especially those that need assistance now. It is about putting people back to work and helping small businesses invest and create jobs for the benefit of middle-income families. That is what we all want, and that is what our family businesses are about. That is what we all support.  In addition, House Republicans have an amendment in their tax bill that takes $200 million from a $500 bonus for small businesses and gives that money to a small business loan program to help American small businesses invest in capital to help American families, and it puts this money into the economy so that it goes to companies who would otherwise not need it.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.

And you can tell the difference between people that believe this is a bad bill and people that believe it is a good bill.  I just wanted to ask the gentlelady, as I think she has been very good and very diligent and extremely constructive in all this time, what she was able to accomplish on the floor of the House and to get this bill passed, and I will certainly look forward to hearing her take some time to talk to her constituents, in this case my constituents, and talk about the real impact that this bill will have on their districts and the millions of people that we represent.

I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from California [Mr. Pombo].  Mr. Pombo's amendment would prohibit the Department of Defense from using funds appropriated in this bill for the construction of a memorial to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.

amendment 2: ``Reject all efforts to impair the United States' strategic position.''  Now, I will vote for this amendment. I will vote against the amendment. I was for it in 2008. It should be rejected again this year.  I might mention this. It was not put in the Constitution, but was put into the Balanced Budget Act. The balanced budget amendment that was proposed by this Senator was proposed by a Democrat President. So it was a Democrat President who proposed a balanced budget amendment that was rejected. I am not going to hold the President responsible for that.  The President, after the elections, did not support this balanced budget amendment. He did not support any deficit reduction that was suggested. I can understand that. But it was in the Balanced Budget Act, and the Congress responded by passing a balanced budget amendment.  So if I am going to give this to the Senate, I should have gone to the President, if I could, and we would have done something that was in the President's interest.  I am not going to vote against this amendment.

I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3221, the American Overseas Interests Act. I want to thank the chairman of the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), and the ranking member, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), for their hard work on this important legislation.  The American Overseas Interests Act is a commonsense piece of legislation that will provide the U.S. Government with the tools it needs to promote U.S. foreign policy interests around the world.  The American Overseas Interests Act authorizes the President to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements with foreign governments to promote U.S. foreign policy interests.

Sen. Bill Young has been the leader in the fight for quality, affordable health care in Utah for 25 years, and for a long time he has been right. The health care reform bill we are about to consider today is not the health care reform bill that my colleagues and I have worked for. It is not a health care reform bill that is similar to the plan that I had before being elected to the State Senate.  There are many important differences. We have a bipartisan bill that does not take the position that we are going to take the Federal Government's money and let it be spent on the poor, on the elderly, on the disabled. That is a good policy.  We have a bill that does take the position that we want a system that is good for doctors, good for patients, and a system that we want it in America that works for everybody. This is a step in the right direction. It is a step that many of us in Congress have been asking for since we got into the U.S. Senate last year.  It is a step that would restore health care and pay for it. It is a step that would guarantee that we have a doctor's pay as a condition for receiving Federal Medicaid funds. We have the right to

The Senator from Connecticut knows the value of time. I appreciate the comments he just made. I know you are in the Senate and I hope he will listen to us. We have a lot to deal with right now, and we have a lot of important work to do. There is no doubt in my mind about the role the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Massachusetts will play in the legislative process, working on behalf of those who need it the most. We are here for the most part on this side, but they are always available when we need them.  We are in the midst of a serious financial crisis, a difficult time for millions of Americans. We are in the midst of a difficult time, and the impact of this crisis on the everyday lives of so many will never be fully seen, unless, of course, we get the Federal Government to act. The Senator is exactly right about this. There are many challenges we face in the Senate today. We are all in the House and the Senate together. But you can't have it both ways.  We have to move forward in this body, and this is an important issue for all of us in this House. We need to move forward. We need to do something on this.  We hear

Rockefeller, the President of the United States and my distinguished colleague from New York, said ``I would like to see America get the $3.5 trillion it owes to the United Nations'' in order to avoid a conflict with the United States.  In the speech before the National Foreign Affairs Committee on September 25, 2003, President Clinton said that ``we cannot stand idly by'' while the United Nations is bankrupted by debts from the ``tax cuts and wars.''  How ironic that we are, with all the rhetoric on the foreign policy, arguing to the President that the United Nations is insolvent. He continues to ask the question: ``Wouldn't you agree that it would be good to ask the United Nations to end its financial troubles?''  Let's remember when President Bush asked President Kennedy when he had a problem with the United Nations, did he say that he was insolvent or insolvent, the United Nations, or did he tell him he needed to sit down and talk about it?  Remember when we asked the President for the word ``crisis'' to put the United Nations on the right track?  President Bush said in his speech before the National Foreign Affairs Committee on September 25, 2003: ``At this time, we have

In other words, this bill is designed to create an opportunity for the insurance companies to charge higher premiums. They want to put a price on this. I know the insurance companies all across the country want an easy way out for their profits. They have no other way out because the Democrats are going to take over. If the Democrats control the White House and the Senate, they are going to force insurance companies into the exchanges, force them to buy a new policy, take people off the exchanges and then give them the opportunity to buy their own policies under the same policies they had before. That is what it is all about.  I just want to read this quote that came out today on CNN. I don't know if it's from my colleague from Missouri. This is from CNN, and it says: Democrats are pushing to sell the health care      exchanges to the insurance industry to charge more than      what people have to pay in private insurance programs. They're      pushing the exchange, because they think it will help them      get more government control over health care, and that's what it's all about, and that's why Republicans are holding the line and saying no more.

Frequently Asked Questions about a State's Right to Equal Protection from Eminent Domain.  Where can I get my next mortgage?  The next time the bank asks for an advance payment, they ask the question: How do you know that the advance is fair?  Here is the answer: The answer, of course, is that it is fair.  These are examples that come to mind: Where could you tell that I didn't have sufficient credit? I did. I borrowed a $200 loan from the bank. My bank loan was a $100 loan. I am now in the middle of a foreclosure in our home.  This is all true and, I believe, is true of all sorts of other mortgages, which are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act as well. Where could you tell that I didn't have enough credit?  For this reason and other reasons, I have argued in State and Federal court that this authority, in fact, does not apply to mortgages that are exempt from the Bank Secrecy Act.  In addition, even where the Bank Secrecy Act applies, there are exceptions in the Bank Secrecy Act to allow banks to purchase homes, and in the case of the Mortgage Market Development Act and the Mortgage Market Regulatory Relief Act,

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus recently unveiled his proposal for an improved Medicare prescription drug benefit to restore coverage for the senior citizens of America. These are great Americans who are struggling to meet their medical expenses, and their drug costs are rising, especially in this era of skyrocketing drug prices.  This proposal would, in fact, provide a generous tax break to help American families meet the mounting health care costs. Seniors across the country need and deserve a health care plan that will lower their costs, improve access and affordability, provide the tools they need and the services they deserve, and preserve their dignity.  The Republican proposal will put seniors' access to health care in the forefront and reduce barriers to quality health care for our Nation's senior citizens. In addition, the Republican plan will ensure that senior citizens have the opportunity to buy their prescription drugs through the Medicare drug program.  I want to thank Senator Baucus and my fellow Democrats for their hard work in bringing this proposal before this body. Our Nation's senior citizens need it, and they deserve it.

Rent this building.  Mr. Speaker, it's the fifth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The events of that day were particularly tragic for the people of the United States of America. The events and the ensuing loss of life resulted in the largest single loss of life on American soil since World War II, the second largest worldwide loss of life in any war since World War I.  On that night, the building in New York that houses the World Trade Center was set on fire. In New York, a second World Trade Center building, also at the south end of that building, burned just a few hours later.  The United States has been a leader in protecting our Nation from such attacks since the day that 9/11. Since then, we have responded aggressively and forcefully to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in our country and have taken decisive action to secure the homeland.  However, this tragedy in our country is not the only tragedy that is facing the Nation. Over the last 5 years we have lost almost 7,500 servicemen and women, many of whom have been wounded or killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their sacrifices and those of their families will not be forgotten. Our Nation is also facing a serious threat from a terrorist
