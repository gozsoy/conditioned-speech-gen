AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. We're broadcasting from New York City.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, we begin today's broadcast with a story from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which released a report last week on how the U.S. government uses drones to kill suspected terrorists around the world. The report, titled "Drones and Terrorist Threats to U.S. and U.S.S.R. Civilian Aircraft," says the U.S. government has carried out more than 1,000 drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and elsewhere since 2001. The report says the U.S. has carried out more than 3,000 drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and elsewhere since 2009. The report also says the U.S. has carried out more than 2,000 drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and elsewhere since 2009.

I was asked to submit a list of some of the questions my recent guest has asked me on social media, which is a good thing since I don't have to answer them in person, because I get asked this way all the time. A lot of times it turns out to be more fun than it appears at first glance, like "Do you take your dog to work when you're not home?" or "What's the deal with you and your husband?" or "What do you do with all of the pet peeves you get?"

My answer is probably a combination of everything that's best for me (unless I can't see you or even communicate with you), but I think at least a few of these would apply to people who write "I've done this before" posts for a living. In fact, it's my hope that the answer you find below might help you deal with some of the same questions that our guest did:

1. What is your pet peeve?

In my first article on this, I tried to outline four main pet peeves I've come across in my job:

Laying around in a pile of litter boxes.

Using toilet paper, or toilet paper and sanitary napkins.

Pumping water in the dishwasher.

Pumping up your dog's leg every once in a while.

The good news is that once you figure out the pet peeves you have, there's not a whole lot of things you can do about it. They're probably better left behind as part of the baggage you toss out into the garbage. So what does one do when his or her job involves putting down a dog? Well, this list is, frankly, pretty easy to find, even if it's not the "most" useful:

1. Talk to people who use the toilets

In your list above, I mentioned that you should get to know the people who use the toilet and what their "fun and happiness" habits are. The interesting part about going to those people is that if they're sharing what they do to help ease your soul after you've done a lot of these things, chances are that their stories make you feel a lot better.

There's plenty of research into the fact that people report higher levels of happiness following conversations with those who live by nature, go to nature, or have pets. The difference lies in not having to go through something so embarrassing and painful like petting someone's

 he has looked at that, and that is a good one, and I do appreciate his point. We had a disagreement over the budget this past year, and now the next Congress is expected to be a very different thing. So we will have a very different process than we are accustomed to, and I think there is a good chance that in that next Congress, as we try to rebuild the American Dream, we are going to look at it with a focus on the priorities that are right here, and there are certainly some areas where we can do much better, but I am hopeful that we can put those priorities into action and we can find ways to provide relief for the people who are trying to get by in this economy.

First of all, I would like to thank the gentleman from New York [Mr. Boehlert] for his leadership on this issue, and I would like to thank the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Hoyer] for his leadership on this issue as well.  I would like to say to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Boehlert] that I think it is very important that we have this debate. I think it is very important that we have this discussion.

In its May 31 report on the Federal debt, CBO estimated that Congress' overall debt would exceed the combined outstanding obligations of the national debt, Social Security, and Federal Government. Congress, CBO predicted, would not pay the debt on any bill passed by Congress. Congress would not pay the debt on the debt of the Federal Government, the debt of the Federal Government. Congress would not pay the debt for which the Federal Government has borrowed, which is not paid on.  The failure to pay the debt of the Federal Government in the context of the deficit means the American people will not be able to provide the cash that they need to keep their homes, their homes, their homes. And, because of the debt, that is a situation that will not be remedied in the future. So there will be the inability, under the circumstances we're facing right now, to make that payment for the purposes of that deficit reduction, the deficit reduction, which will be the Federal debt.  And then the very next year, in the year 2030, it's going to be the deficit, if I can predict with some certainty, the deficit reduction, which will be the Federal debt. Because the country's economic future, and the national budget, as it was made by the original authors of this, was predicated upon a deficit reduction. And the Federal Government was projected to have to borrow at most 3\1/2\ percent of what it had spent in the year 2001.  So the debt is being brought into existence, and the current situation of the American people is not sustainable, because it will be a situation where the national debt will exceed what it was in the year 2001.  I don't want to see the United States default on its debts, but I do want to see a deficit reduction and a balanced budget by the year 2035. And the President's budget, under our plan, will balance the Federal budget in 10 years.

Budget relief for people and families at the top will cut taxes by $4.6 trillion. It will create jobs. It will take more money out of the pockets of middle class families. And that means a lot of American families will have to pay a lot more.  It will also put Americans back to work, as we saw in the last 8 months of the last 8 years with a lot of job creation and a lot of job creation at the lower income level.  One more example of that: People at the bottom are going to be working harder and longer hours, and that means a lot of lower-income families are going to be working longer hours and working harder and longer.  So while we get back to work, we will also have more jobs, fewer jobs, and higher wages to help working families.  I thank the Chair, and I urge adoption of the bill.

A spokesman for the Agriculture Department said it would be inappropriate for a panel to comment on an agency's financial statements unless the panel has the expertise of an expert.  ``The Federal Office of Thrift Supervision cannot comment on the content of information provided in a GAO study regarding financial reporting and other matters,'' according to the spokesman. ``Our panel has had no input into this issue.''  The statement went on to say that the inspector general for the Agriculture Department, ``will continue to support the agency's work on this matter.''  Yesterday, in his remarks, the Secretary of Agriculture addressed concerns about his budget request. He said that he ``fully expects'' the President to ``continue to provide guidance and support to our financial officers and fund managers to ensure their financial situation is not adversely affected by Federal spending decisions.''  In the Senate, I was unable to obtain from the Department of the Interior some sort of information about its financial condition. The Agriculture and the Department of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee is the most important committee on which to review the matter. I would be happy to work with the conferees on the budget.  I am, however, very interested in seeing how it does in a subsequent budget resolution, given that the administration is clearly in disarray about its financial situation, and that the Congress has been prevented from even having a vote on the matter because of an ongoing investigation of a former Treasury Secretary. The bill before us today is not a real reform, is not a real deficit reduction package, and it does not address the issue of waste.  If we can get a real solution to this problem, we ought to have an opportunity to debate it. It may be that the President will respond, because we ought to know. But until that time, there ought to be an opportunity to discuss this issue with the administration before we reach a vote on this legislation.  The

With the CFPB providing the best value in our marketplace, we welcome these new reforms and look forward to continuing to work with the CFPB to ensure that all of our members have a fair playing field to play in the marketplace.''  For the past 10 months the CFPB has been negotiating for reform with the airline industry, but despite this process, industry interest has been frustrated. Now, the airlines have made clear they are willing to continue to negotiate the reforms without fear of being forced to pay back the money owed to them for the unfair practices that took place under the original CFPB's initial efforts.  Let me also say that I support the efforts of my colleague from Illinois, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Kirk, who has done an outstanding job working with the airlines in this effort. I know the airlines will continue to take the necessary steps to correct these unfair practices and they will continue to work closely with the CFPB to assure our stakeholders that the reforms are fair and that they will be transparent to all sides. We have said it, and we are taking them up on that.  This is not about one CEO versus another. This is about all the stakeholders, all the employees, and all of the customers in this country being treated fairly and in a fair way.  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be able to come together and work with us in a bipartisan way to make this a reality, to allow the airlines to negotiate the reforms without fear of losing the money they have made since we left the CFPB, and to continue this fight until they bring us an honest, equitable and just agreement.

Senator Grassley said the Senate would be doing its work if the rule for the rulemaking were changed. We are not in the business of changing the rule on the Senate floor.

Senator Sanders and I have been waiting for a while. If I may, I would like to take a minute or two to express our appreciation to my colleague from Massachusetts for his remarkable leadership and for his unwavering commitment to working for all Americans.  I want to thank him, Senator Sanders, for your tremendous leadership on behalf of working families.  I also want to thank my colleague Senator Boxer and Senator Blumenthal. They were instrumental in passing the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which we passed last year, which will prevent frivolous lawsuits, which has meant more victims and fewer victims.  I also want to thank Senator Chafee, Senator Warner, and Senator Levin. These men and women have worked hard to protect our hard-earned credit card numbers from being compromised.  I also want to thank my colleague from Texas, Senator Cruz. As he has said so often in this debate--I want to make sure it is understood this way: We want to build a strong economy. But we also want to do it responsibly.  There are many ways in which you can do that. You can take a look at reducing fraud. You can make sure that fraud is being brought to your attention by filing a fraud alert to make sure that you don't have innocent people getting into trouble. Or you can give people a tool to come forward and ask for help, if you need help, in dealing with a real problem.  But the way I would like to close this debate is by telling a story of how one of our colleagues came to be concerned about the quality of our credit card system. He was making the tough calls and he had the toughest of all the phone calls. This individual called and talked to his office about an employee he knew who had been arrested. His name was Jeffrey D. Wolden. He was a well-respected senior at the University of Texas at Dallas.  After many phone calls and a letter of recommendation, this individual got a letter from the United States Department of Education saying that this individual who was working for the University of Texas at Dallas was not eligible to get a Federal credit card. So he was thrown out of the program.  Well, guess what? He had the option of taking a job as an analyst or as a card processor for the Federal Government. His job was to verify the eligibility of every American. That is what he was doing.  Because he wanted to do something for the students of Texas, he took a job in Florida. And he was willing to work for the Federal Government

In the debate on gun reform, one of the hallmarks of our debate is the notion of an ``all or nothing'' approach. I firmly believe that the law should reflect the public's desire to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous criminals.  It is that belief that has led me to support the second-degree amendment, a constitutional amendment to the United States Constitution. Unfortunately, we continue to disagree on the wisdom of this approach. The issue seems to be whether or not we believe the Government should be required to confiscate the guns of people who are convicted of a crime or not. It is an issue of political correctness, and it's a question of whether our Government is going to do its job when it comes to ensuring that criminals do not get guns they can't afford and criminals do not get guns they can't afford.  As a result, the issue seems to be a political one. It's hard to believe that Congress would be faced with a constitutional amendment like the one I'm proposing that would make it a crime in America to have or sell or have or have possession of a weapon that is prohibited from being possessed or used in the commission of a crime.  Some opponents of the second-degree amendment think that only a few of us would support a constitutional amendment like this one. That is not the case. I'm talking about over 100 Members who support a constitutional amendment like this, who would oppose it. My colleagues have no right to force the Senate to debate the issue of whether or not the second-degree amendment is constitutional. But they have every right to debate the merits of the amendment. They may also have the right to have the debate. However, the Senate is bound by Senate rules, and they must follow the rules and be bound by precedent to consider such a constitutional amendment. I think it is clear to all of our colleagues that we must vote for the second-degree amendment.  I am a firm believer that people do not want guns in the hands of criminals or felons. Yet my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats alike, have come to the same conclusion: that some of us do. We want to do everything we can to ensure that people are not putting their lives at risk by buying or possessing a gun that has been convicted of a crime.  If I were asked to make a judgment about whether the United States should be a nation that has laws that made it illegal to own or use a gun to commit a crime, I'd say we should ban guns immediately and strongly. I don

Senator McCain is not the only one who is concerned about what could happen if the Senate passes a continuing resolution. I think that the debate is important and important to make sure the people who have the highest health care needs are protected and to make sure they get the help they need, the help they need now. I think the American people want us to make sure that if this CR passes, the emergency supplemental bill is done so quickly so that the people who are struggling to get by and are already concerned about their health care situation do not have to wait until the winter because this House is doing this thing again, we're going to get it done as quickly as possible.  We were successful in getting a bill passed in the House of Representatives that had a lot of provisions that the Senate did not have in it. So if we were to pass this continuing resolution today, if we could get the House of Representatives to pass the Senate-passed bill, and we got the House of Representatives to pass the Senate-passed bill that was passed in the House, and then the Senate-passed bill got vetoed by the President, I think we can do it.  I know my friend from Arizona is a leader on veterans issues, and he has been a real leader on these issues, but I agree that the supplemental bill is a good bill, but I think we have got to make sure we do something about it.

I rise today to oppose the bill, H.R. 2921, the Nuclear Waste Disposal Reform Act of 1995. I oppose this bill because it represents an unprecedented intrusion by Congress into the power of the States to determine the appropriate disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a State by State. This is not a well-intended and safe legislation. I strongly disagree with the bill's underlying intent, which is to make sure that the disposal of spent nuclear fuel in the United States is safe and environmentally sound.  First of all, let me be very clear. I believe we should keep the spent fuel rods at Yucca Mountain. I will vote for that because I believe the technology there is now and the nuclear waste is there, and the reactor itself is there. But I will vote no on this bill, because the people in my State want to have their own idea. I represent a State that is concerned with the environment and the environment and the health of its citizens. It is absolutely important that we, as Congress, have the ability to ensure the disposal of spent fuel in a safe and responsible manner.  Second, I am very supportive of the nuclear waste repository concept, which is the only way we can ensure that we can properly dispose of the spent fuel rods at Yucca Mountain. Nuclear waste disposal is one of the most cost-effective methods of disposing nuclear waste, but I believe we must also, in my opinion, consider the cost-effectiveness as well. But at the same time, we need to make sure that we do the most cost-effective way. That is what this bill does.  Let me explain what this bill is all about. This bill is an unprecedented intrusion into State power by the Federal Government. If you read the bill in its entirety, it does not say there will be any public hearing. It says if you feel that the State needs that extra money to carry out this program, there is a mechanism by which that money can be spent.  I find this a somewhat shocking statement to make, given what the American people expect us to do every day. You talk about the American people being given a free vote on this, but the Constitution grants the States the responsibility to pass budgets and to vote in elections, not to have this kind of mandate placed on them by a new bill.  Now, when we talk about this bill, what I am suggesting is we look at where is the money being spent. I think we have to ask, why do we want to mandate that we have
