 Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today in an effort to get an amendment done for the State of Delaware.  The Delaware State Senate voted on a vote on this amendment on Wednesday.  The Delaware State Senator opposed the amendment and voted to pass the bill. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding 2 minutes.  I think he would have been voting for the amendment, but would have voted for the amendment.  That was true; the gentleman offered a couple of solutions. The gentleman said that it would not be appropriate for the State of Delaware to have all its resources to take care of what the State could have had; that it would not be necessary for the State of Delaware to take a loan; and that it would be necessary for the State of Delaware to have some money and some money and some other thing that it could do, to help the State of Delaware deal with what it is in the State of Delaware.  I want to thank the gentleman for yielding 2 minutes.

 Madam President, I had the privilege of hosting the annual National Women's History Day in 2007 at the Washington State University Capitol. I remember that year and the day during that time, there was a group of women, some with American-born and other immigrant heritage, from Virginia and Southern California, whose names I had forgotten. I was struck with how many women and men, including my great-great-grandmother, were represented on that day. The number that came together was a good reminder that there is more to be accomplished this year, and we have the opportunity now to celebrate the women's history in every country, and especially in the history of our country.  In the United States, there are over 3 million women and men on the Federal Government, which is one of the most diverse and diverse organizations in our State. The University of Virginia, in particular, is an amazing place to live, and they are leading an incredible national scholarship that will change the lives of those in this country. I believe the University of Virginia is right across this country. We are about as diverse as the stars may be, but they are also, at their core, about our values of service, civility, and tolerance. We do not discriminate against men, women,

 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. King), a member of the Rules Committee.  Mr. KREMLER. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for a bipartisan effort to make this bill more competitive and in line with the law. I have been a supporter of the H.R. 3 appropriations bill for nearly 2 decades, but the fact is, we are working hard to get this bill up and moving. The process I have put forth to make sure this legislation makes more sense than the current funding levels on the House floor is. This bill simply requires that the funding levels for the bill increase based on the needs of the country's health and our economy and our families and our businesses.  This bill would require our manufacturers to pay for a number of key health reforms, like reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, reducing our dependence on prescription drugs and ensuring we are working to protect our communities. The fact is, the legislation does not require manufacturers to pay for comprehensive health reform. Instead, it requires that each manufacturer pay for a new comprehensive reform to ensure they have a sustainable approach to wellness and wellness outcomes and promote responsible use of medical products.

 Mr. Speaker, on another matter, I want to note the gentleman's view of the gentleman's place on this side of the aisle. I think it was said to him, ``the best is the best,'' because his position was the best position of the Speaker. He supported it, but his position was to take away from Speaker Pelosi and their political career. The fact of the matter is, the Republican leadership came together in an overwhelming majority of the House of Representatives and one would not like to see the Speaker's party go down the same road of an endless process of obstruction, obstruction, obstruction, obstruction that they are so busy with.  I do not think, Mr. Speaker, that the gentleman should be in control of his own party, so he should be on the far right of the Republican agenda.

I was here yesterday to speak on a matter that affects my State, my country, and our people every day in this body, and that is the issue of whether this Nation stands with its God-given freedom to defend the Constitution against attack.  Let me tell you what happened last night in Haiti. This was a devastating earthquake. Nearly 2,000 Haitians were displaced from their homes in the capital of Mombou Province. The Haitians had just moved to the new territory of Haiti--the second largest city in the country--and there were two sanitation systems in the city and a sewage system in the city. The Haitian Government held a press conference with the Haitian Government and asked them to send the men and women to their homes. The Haitian Government's response, according to the American-Iranian relationship, was prompt.  After 3 hours of deliberation and many speeches, the Haitian Government sent them out to the U.N. Security Council, and the Haitian Government asked the United States to provide them to their country. This President, of course, said it again: ``We ask our

 Mr. President, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is now the largest project in the history of the United States. On March 15, 1969, the Corps of Engineers was authorized by Congress to carry out the project. Its main activities are for building dams, flood control, and dredging. It was designed to protect the public and the environment. In 1968, the Corps of Engineers was created by Congress to carry out a project for construction, one which has remained the Nation's major undertaking and the only one that has ever taken more than 50 years to complete.  This is about $14 billion to build and maintain the most vital infrastructure in the world. It is the only way to achieve total energy security in this country, but it is the only way to do it for the American people.  The Corps of Engineers' work is funded and put on hold until we can make them work as they ought to be and meet the needs of the American people. I have heard from several colleagues who are familiar with the Corps of Engineers work and have worked for many years to reach a certain amount. In 1968, the Corps was authorized by Congress to carry out the project. During a brief debate at the committee on March 15, 1969, Chairman Frelinghuys

 Mr. President, I have spoken before on the floor to try to make some real substantive changes to our immigration system, including the removal of U.S. citizens from Canada, which is a practice that is being reported a lot, but the President has failed to agree to this. The reality is that, of course, this practice continues and grows worse as the U.S. continues to struggle in the face of an incredible influx of illegal immigrants.  As a result of this practice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, BOGE, have implemented a 5-year program to ensure that illegal immigration in Canada will not occur unless the U.S. does not enforce these laws.  This 5-year policy will create a 50-year-old barrier to illegal immigration with very little predictability. With the President's commitment to remove U.S. citizens from Canada and encourage the United States to follow the law, the U.S. is set to become the first country in the world to enforce the law. The U.S. has no enforcement mechanism to determine whether to enforce our laws or not, but the U.S. has a strong policy for ensuring that our laws do not

 Madam President, we know the government is in trouble and we know this body has taken on a serious leadership crisis and has forgotten how to govern. It is with great sadness that I make the sad, but certainly true, statement of my late colleague, Senator Thune.  Thune was a key member of our Senate and I was the minority leader of the Senate. As a member of the Senate, I was a fierce voice on these issues and on the need for consensus. But at the same time, as Senator Thune and I, along with the rest of the Senate, on behalf of the people of the House and the people of the Senate, we fought for the American people. We have been fighting for the people of the United States for many years. I believe it is our national security interests that we should hold ourselves and our allies accountable for this attack against the United States of America and work to address this crisis.  The attacks of September 11, 2001, brought all nations into conflict with each other, and it was a symbol of tyranny. And, yes, President Bush and President Clinton sent an alarmingly bold threat to the place where people should be. We have a special interest in this place, and we would love to have you as part

 Madam Chairwoman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from the Virgin Islands, the gentleman from the State of Washington (Mr. Ryan), by way of introduction of this amendment, and thank him for his leadership and leadership on this issue and the need to do a good job.  The amendment I would like to introduce is the SECURE PRINT Act of 2009, which is a legislative companion to H.R. 2134. This legislation authorizes and authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to provide $250,000 in incentive for security investigators to conduct internal data collection on behalf of the taxpayer.  SECURE PRINT Act, as it was drafted by Congress in 1891, is a bill that provides the Treasury Department the right to issue and collect certain regulations, but the statute specifically allows that right to be waived and limited. H.R. 2134, as amended, simply clarifies that Treasury Department employees are permitted to set the threshold for issuing and collecting an audit for an act of public disclosure.  This legislation was originally introduced in 2007 by Senator Dorgan and Senator John McCain, along with Senators Kennedy and Rockefeller.  While the bill created some controversy, with the understanding that this bill would now apply to the entire

I just want to make a statement here, and I think you're absolutely right, the Republican Party has been in this mess and in this debate here. The American people have been frustrated. They've heard the Republican Party talk about how the government cannot keep its promises, but they've heard the Democratic Party talking about how the government can never keep its promises.  People do feel like they have to work all day and all night to get to where we are, but it seems as if the Republicans in the Senate, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the majority of this country seem to be telling us this is the way we are going to get there. They seem to think it's about time, the more they show us the way, the more it appears to be, and the more it is that they think they can make things happen, and the more they don't think it can happen, the more they don't think they can help it happen.

We need to do more. This will take the attention away from the deficit and get Americans back to work.  What we are trying to do is look at the debt itself. What we are trying to do is give the American people back their basic right to have credit to them, and for some of us, that is a basic right, but not for the American people.

 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the historic Heartland Rock Church of Christ, in my hometown of Washington, D.C., for its years of service and devotion to its God-given mission of providing high quality healthcare for people in need of quality, affordable care.  As a mother of three, I firmly believed in the importance of family and faith and felt that it was incumbent upon me to serve with my wife. My wife and I served our country together as missionaries in Iraq during World War II and, at times, as members of the United States Army in World War II.  In the 1980s, I was in the House of Representatives with the then-Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the former Governor of New York. We served together as the only Members of the Senate from Rhode Island to serve alongside each other. I am a true believer in the importance of faith, and I am very proud of my service to our constituents.  In addition to my wife and I, I have been a frequent visitor in Washington and our offices and the Capitol. Every morning I come to the Capitol to visit my fellow Capitol Hill citizens, and as a result I always have the opportunity to look around and visit the monuments and other cultural icons of the Capitol, especially

 Mr. President, we are in a very difficult place today with a lot of heavy-handed and a lot of political partisanship at work in the Senate. We have a special interest tax bill coming before the Senate that is important for this country. In the midst of this debate, as my dear friend from Texas, Senator Donnelly, who is running for the seat, and even Senator Johanns are here, Senator Kennedy has proposed legislation to fund the Environmental Protection Agency. Senator McConnell, who is also my good friend, is sponsoring that bill in the hopes that it will actually become law so that we could pay for the EPA's bill, because they say this bill is the right thing for the country.  It is not a surprise. It is a long time coming for our country to come together and negotiate the solutions for America. It is time to go through this process. It is time to take the tough decisions that are necessary and not the political ones that would be needed in order to deal with the consequences. It is time to take a moment for a moment and walk through the process.

 Madam President, as we rise in the Senate, I will be speaking in very few minutes about a topic that is so critical to me. Tomorrow, with a large group of Senators, I will be doing a short-term, perhaps critical work period on a piece of legislation that will actually take us to the next frontier--a frontier that has not been imagined before--as it takes us back to the most serious debate I have ever had in my life--a debate that would see America and the world in complete agreement on many key issues.  While my job is to represent the Nation, the Senator from Illinois has been the lead sponsor on legislation, and that is why I am here today to thank him for his hard work and his friendship. I rise today to join my colleagues in supporting the underlying measure, the Justice for All Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in January of this year.  I had hoped that by the end of this year, after a few weeks of debate and the adoption of the underlying measure, we might see the end of this fight--but we have not. I also hope we will be able to start some of the important work of legislation we have seen coming over the last few months.  I have said this

 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Colorado for his efforts on this important bill, and, as always, I appreciate his work.  Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan energy bill, H.R. 1, was written under a difficult time in Washington. One of the goals of this bill is to provide an exemption for the EPA from regulatory permitting for coal-fired powerplants.  The bill will ensure that the American Society of Civil Engineers is able to review and recommend the rules that will be in effect for the powerplant application, and this bill will ensure that they do. The bill also is supported by numerous State and local partners.  This bill is the product of months of hard work and a lot of effort on both sides of the aisle. The energy bills deserve our attention and, more importantly, to those States that need this type of energy to compete and thrive in the future.  Mr. Speaker, the American people have a right to expect the environment will provide the energy that will bring these companies in, and we should have a debate about whether there is any need to use new coal-fired powerplants.  The American people deserve better than to have a debate on whether we should allow for new, efficient coal-fired power

Today, I rise in support of H.R. 3246, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2019, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2019, or the FAIR Act of 2019, to ensure that the United States is acting in a manner that protects Main Street and Main Streets for Main Street children, and the people of the United States, from unregulated financial activity.  As we continue to see the regulatory burden on our constituents in this country, it is important that we recognize the impact that unregulated financial activity has on our communities and families.  As a member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, I am committed to working with Congress to ensure the administration understands that unregulated activities in our country can create unnecessary risks to local communities, businesses, and communities of the United States, particularly small businesses and families. I am pleased that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has provided additional, bipartisan leadership in support of this legislation, along with the co-sponsors of the Financial CHOICE Act of 2019.  On this day, I wish to speak out in strong support of H.R. 3246, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2019.  In April of 2019,

 Mr. Chairman, let's be clear, there are some good areas in this economy we do not support, and some of those areas that we do not support and some that we do not support require jobs to be there in order to create the jobs we are looking for.  We have a bill that would extend a 30 percent payroll tax credit to stimulate the economy and provide tax relief for the small business owners who benefit most from this program. It would do so in the midst of a very important debate that has been going on, but this program would extend that payroll tax credit and would provide a tax relief to the small business owners who have so often fought for this tax relief through legislation that we just passed this morning, so that they get a level of tax relief and it can be used to get money back into the economy.  I thank my friends on the other side for making this possible.

 Mr. Speaker, the problem here is that the Republicans have a filibuster that is about time. They have another one which is about using the tax cut in their stimulus package. This one is not about using it. It is about using it by an inordinate amount of time. It is about a filibuster that is going to take effect. It is about using the bill itself, the stimulus bill, which is already using it.  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate, but I would say, to put this aside and to put these things back in, there is a lot of time and effort on the Democratic side to have it brought up. I would simply say to the Republicans that they are going to do whatever they need to do, whatever they can get them to do, which means the filibuster will take effect.  It appears that it is going to take over 2 weeks for the House to come up with the bill for the first time in almost a decade. That is, at the first sign of trouble, there are now four bills in the last 2 months. These four bills are almost $1.5 trillion in debt.  It looks as though there has been a lot of attention, although I haven't heard a lot of speeches on the other side

 Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the National Poison Center Protection Act of 2013. This legislation would end the current ban on poison centers across the United States. This legislation would remove the Federal ban on poison centers, which is just the latest in the series of programs to undermine the national health and safety standards set by the Safe Drinking Water Act.  More specifically, poison centers are the Nation's largest sources of contamination in drinking water. In 2016, the National Poison Center Network, which represents more than 1,200 poison centers across the country, received nearly $500 million in grants to prevent deaths from poisoning and damages from exposure to poisoned water.  For me, this legislation ensures that poison centers do not go without a major grant for their public-private investment. The legislation has been applauded by the American Public Health Association, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, and others.  The national poison center bill also requires that the poison center funding be used exclusively for public health research. The bill includes $2 million to ensure that every dollar spent on health research is matched against the budget of the underlying national health policy.  According to the American Public Health Association, the funds provided by the poison center bill provide critical resources that will improve public health by keeping public health

 Mr. President, the Senate has a lengthy debate on a very important piece of legislation that has been pending on the Senate floor for the past 8 years. As I have indicated time and time again, it is time to recognize the serious, bipartisan nature of this important legislation. It has been brought to the floor over the years to debate and vote on that legislation.  The House is expecting to vote this morning, and I hope my colleagues will come to the floor and ask for a vote. There is no way that we could be doing it. We are not in any way trying to legislate that legislation. We are not in any way trying to have a debate on a piece of legislation.  As I will describe today, this legislation has been pending for the past 4 years. Its name is called ``Cabinet Reform.'' It was named after Senator Tom Coburn, the President of the Republican Party, who passed out his health care bill in November of 1997 and whose motion to proceed to this bill--he was the Democratic leader--was approved by the Senate--the President of the United States--and it has been a very important part of the Democratic Party's agenda.

 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) for introducing this resolution.  This week, the White House and the Republican majority continue to focus on the urgent crisis facing the U.S. Congress, and on the President's promise of a constitutional impeachment trial.  As the minority leader, I had no idea that the President had made a pledge to the American people about his willingness to try a foreign power to block his investigations into all the other facts that have been put forward. And as this resolution was being introduced, the people from Texas, the people from Washington, the people from Florida, the people from Texas, and the people from California know, well, the stakes are high for this. And so what is happening right now in this country is absolutely nothing short of immoral, unconstitutional or immoral.  So, Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate and to wish all those who are watching this ``game of chicken'' as well as the American people to know that if you are going to have a trial and you're going to take up this impeachment inquiry, you've got to have a trial.  You've got to have a trial. And you've got to have a trial. A constitutional trial is not

 Madam President, I will be brief. This is a very different type of bill.  The Senator from Connecticut and I, whom we know as the Senator from Connecticut, came to the floor to talk about this in very general terms. It has got to do with the Senator from Connecticut.  What I am going to say about this and what I will say about the other amendments that are coming down are that I have not really seen the process on the floor of the Senate as far as what people would like to see us do. I am going to speak about something that has been going on for a long time now, and there are times in the Senate that they have been talking about this as a process--something they have done.  I have been on the floor many times talking about this. It seems to be one of those times. But I can tell you it is different and it goes to all of us in different ways, and that is that the process is going to be different and that it is different.

If we can't get it across the finish line, it doesn't matter.  We can't possibly do that.

 Mr. President, I was proud to attend today's historic hearing at the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. I was particularly proud to be there in the midst of the day's most significant legislative battle between President Trump and Republicans in the Senate.  Senator Schumer and I have been working on this issue for years, but the latest effort by Republicans to have a vote on this piecemeal approach to immigration in a bipartisan and bicameral way--with a handful of bipartisan Senators representing all 12 U.S. Senators--to undermine and stop the growth of this Nation and the growth of what is at stake here--their approach would do nothing to stop immigration or deal with what is now the highest-income and fastest growing economy in the world, which is the 21st century.  In an effort to actually increase, grow, and invest in border security, they would deny even meaningful reforms, undermine the Senate's ability to have immigration and immigration reform as a bipartisan issue that both sides understand very well.  They could, in fact, limit the opportunity to do comprehensive immigration reform and immigration reform at a time when the administration has made that argument repeatedly.  We want comprehensive immigration reform. Let's be honest about it. We want to

Today, in the very center of my district, it is the city's George Floyd memorial that commemorates the life and death of the late Black community's first victim and a symbol of the Black response to violence in the City of Baltimore.  There, in an attempt to remove a statue of the late Dr. George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement sought to correct the centuries-old racist stain that Black Lives Matter has already borne on their statues.  Today, in the spirit of ``justice and justice is the same as life, the same as good,'' Black Lives Matter has turned from a symbolic yet essential, and it is the same as the color of Black men's minds and the blood of Black people
