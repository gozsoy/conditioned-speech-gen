What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is issued and managed by computers on the Internet. There is no central bank. It is widely accepted by the public and there is no limit to the number of Bitcoins. Bitcoins are sent worldwide via computer, and are linked to one's bank account. Users also receive Bitcoins that are held by some of the world's largest banks.

Because there are no financial intermediary in this type of economy, you do not have to wait for a bank account to have the Bitcoins you are depositing in your bank. And you don't have to wait for a bank to accept a Bitcoin as payment.

Are There Any Fees or Charges?

There are no fees to accept Bitcoins or withdraw any Bitcoins you have spent. You don't have to worry about losing Bitcoins to pay for a purchase of something else. There are no transaction fees or credit card fees when you use your Bitcoin to buy or sell things online.

How Does It Work?

A computer in your computer network will verify the identity of a Bitcoin account. If it identifies an account that meets its criteria, the computer will allow the user to initiate a transaction of that type. After that, the computer will then give the user a

Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules be authorized to meet during the session of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, September 23, 2018, at 10 a.m. in room SD-366 of the Russell Senate Office Building.
. If the House continues to pass the resolution, as it was before, the legislation and the President's proposal, the legislation would require that HHS and the agency serving the bill, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in turn, continue to operate under the current law, as is required under this resolution.  As to the underlying legislation, we will continue working with the chairman, House Democratic Leader, as well as the Senate on this, but the legislation passed by the House by a narrow margin, was limited in time and space.  I will be happy to yield to the chairman, but let me remind the majority that a provision, as well as a motion to recommit, will be introduced on Thursday in the House later today.

At a time when the American public is facing a grim crisis over the lack of a living wage, this administration is acting with extreme caution to ensure that workers can keep their jobs while our economy heads into recession. They are doing it, and they are saying so, that there is no alternative. We must do it. They are not saying it anymore. They want us to do it. They are making it more difficult and less productive for most working Americans. They are saying it is, in fact, the only way to prevent a recession.

Workers are doing their part in America, and they are putting the working class on notice. They are saying the time has come to work harder and stay home, not better off. If the Republican Party truly believes we can save jobs and raise wages, then it's time to go home.

 Senator Collins, I rise to pay tribute to my good friend from Massachusetts, who has taken up the mantle of the freshman class as chairman of the committee. As a member of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, he has taken on the responsibility of leading the effort to repeal the dangerous assault on the privacy of Americans by the Obama administration. In addition, he has taken the responsibility of leading the effort to make sure that the committee actually has the resources to take a look at all the issues facing the country and to consider all the appropriate legal and constitutional implications of the issues, to make sure the Senate would not turn into the executive branch.  As a result of that work, I can attest to the seriousness with which Senator Collins was able to lead the effort to do away with this unnecessary regulatory apparatus. I have also always been grateful for his help in writing the report that made sure that the Republican majority was able to go to conference committee and reach a compromise, one that actually included some of the provisions I had pushed for in the Energy bill.  His leadership has been invaluable. I appreciate the hard work he has done on behalf of the freshman class, and we are all grateful for his leadership.

In recent months, the Trump administration has been at war with our neighbors to the south, against our allies and friends around the world. During this administration's War on Coal, the EPA has already moved to increase its own pollution from coal-fired power plants, to cut pollution from smokestacks, and now, to dismantle the Nation's primary source of renewable energy.  Earlier this week, it was announced that the Trump administration was pulling out of the Paris climate accord, and we're only halfway to the finish line, making a final push for the rest of the world to meet our international commitments to move toward a 100 percent clean air and zero waste climate.  This administration needs to do more than just pick a fight with China; the country of China is already doing its part to move toward the zero-carbon future that President Xi Jinping promised. President Trump himself is already standing up to China on their massive emissions of pollution and climate disruption, with his EPA actions already beginning.  So while it seems like President Trump can't stand China's pollution or coal, he's doing everything in his power to make sure that the worst of them never happens again, and this administration is already making it a priority to meet that goal.

I have been on the Appropriations Committee on Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee and will vote against the President's budget because it will destroy the ability of the Department of the Interior to perform its essential functions, and that's why we are here today. The appropriations bill that passed the House today contains $8.3 billion less than the President's proposal.  The Interior appropriations bill continues the Bush's policy of decreasing Federal funding for basic research for new conservation and land restoration projects. This bill includes funding for the Wilderness Society's Great Divide Wilderness--a wilderness in my district that was funded by the Federal Government with little or no assistance.  I've talked to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to see how it will perform the mission of managing these lands for the benefit of future generations and to hear the stories of tribal people in South Dakota. These are the kinds of vital programs that must be managed in a bipartisan way--without cutting them to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.

House Joint Resolution 21 would increase the number of telephone calls a call costs to a consumer from 1,000 to 1,500. It would increase the number of calls that can be made in a row to 1,500, increasing their cost to consumers, for a single call.

 I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. I'm glad to join my friend from Michigan in this discussion because I believe we need to ask ourselves what is really at hand in terms of the war.  Here we are, right now, 6 years into this war. We've been told many, many times that the war is over, and it's not. The enemy has been trained, they have been given training, and we're still waiting for the end of this war. This country was attacked in 2001 and 2002 by terrorists. Yet in 2003, we have seen this country still harboring al Qaeda. It's time to ask ourselves, what are we doing? Why can't we at least show some progress, if we would rather, in the battlefield?  In February, the President decided to end this war and come back to Congress, bring back the authorization of the troops and bring us back to a period of time in which we would finally get this job done.  But, unfortunately, there is no reason to keep this effort going. The President's budget now is $600 billion below the President's request. I'm told this bill will cut by about a third.

On May 12, 2008, President Obama issued Executive Order 1118, which created a new Executive order for the Secretary of Energy. He has continued this Executive order throughout his Presidency as well. At one point, we were told we were not going to hear about his Executive order unless he issued it. Instead, we had several days of debate on this important bill before we were able to vote.  This bill, known as the American Competitiveness Act, establishes a process for the Federal Government to review, approve, and issue certificates of energy efficiency standards. This means that every year, America is going to take into account the environmental benefits of technologies that are being developed overseas. And when you factor in all of the advances that are being made, they are also going to take into account the practicality of those technologies.

Waste products and waste collection systems are designed to help communities and States conserve, and in doing so encourage the recycling of unwanted items. It has been noted that recycling works for communities in Arizona, but this system is not working for many communities across the country.  A 2005 study by the National Assessment Center found that a majority of communities have less than 60 percent of the recycling rate they needed to meet the environmental goals the EPA had set for recycling. Many communities also have relatively low recycling rates because there are few recycling facilities and they do not recycle their trash. That is a significant contributing factor. As a result, more communities are being left behind.  The administration has made increasing efforts to expand the number of recycling programs in order to address this problem. They are working with the State Department of Environment and the private sector, which are starting to move into this area.  As we work together in a bipartisan way to encourage our local communities to clean up their land, we can use the opportunity as neighbors to help ensure that the recycling rate is higher than it currently is.

It is a chart that shows that the difference between what CBO says the baseline was, based on the President's economic assumptions, and the President's budget, based on what we know is the official estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, is $4 trillion in additional spending over 10 years.

Why did the Senate reject a filibuster of this important bill? This is not just the Senate. The Senate Democratic leadership refused to allow us to even consider the legislation before the Senate, with no hearings or committee markup and no debate. The filibuster for this bill is just not about the legislation. It is about the future of this country.  Today we have a bill that is crucial to our security. As a nation, we are going to have to make significant changes in the way that we secure our nation. Some of these changes are necessary, but the time for change is long past, and this is one of the best ways to start the process of making these significant changes.  Why would the Senate take up a measure such as this? The Senate is a deliberative body. The Senate is about deliberation and amendment, and the only way we are going to be able to get a bill through in this manner is to have a full debate, not just an hour or so of debate.  The bill is about the future of this country. It is about what is going to be necessary to make this Nation safer. We need to start the process of making these important changes now.

Washington, DC.-- In honor of the 60th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., a forum for civil rights and education at the University of Maryland's College of William and Mary was held to commemorate the event.  As the only forum for students of color and students of all races in Maryland, it has a distinct and positive impact on the lives of hundreds of students each year.  The University of Maryland's College of William and Mary campus in Annapolis will be the site of the forum, where students will discuss the significance of Martin Luther King, Jr., in our history and culture.  It is also important to note that this forum is part of the work of an organization called ``No Justice for Martin Luther King,'' and it is the first of its kind for the Black community to discuss and learn about issues facing black Americans.  The forum is also part of the academic program that received a national recognition in February of this year by the Black History Association and the National Education Association.  The forum follows the program established in 1986 in Washington, DC, at which students, leaders, and other faculty from around the country came together to discuss issues of the day.

Dudley, Missouri, March 22, 1994.  Senator Robert D. Dole is the President pro tempore of the Senate and is to be laid to rest yesterday at the Fort Bragg Chapel at Fort Bragg.  Senator Dole was a hero of this institution, and in his honor today at his side a casket will be draped with a red ribbon as a memorial to his sacrifice, his patriotism, his respect for democracy, and the ultimate sacrifice.  During the course of his service in the Senate he had his personal heroics displayed on many occasions. At the Republican National Convention in 1976 he was honored for courage and in 1980 for his military service to Vietnam.  At the Republican National Convention in 1976 and again in 1980, Senator Dole, dressed in the gray, buttoned blue uniform of the U.S. Navy, was recognized for his leadership and dedication to his country, to his State of Missouri, and to the people of the United States.  During his Senate career, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, he was known as a ``gravy train'' for the hard work he demonstrated on behalf of the poor and helpless.

House Republicans are considering a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget by year 2002. Now is not the time to break a promise that was made by President Reagan. Congress will not stand idly by and allow Washington to continue spending taxpayer money to pay for an increase in spending that is not necessary.  President Bush promised that a balanced budget by 2002 would be paid for. The Congressional Budget Office has scored this promise to be a false promise. President Bush's budget, however, did not meet the requirement of a balanced budget. The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, has noted that a reduction in our total budget by $4.6 trillion over 10 years would leave a $14.7 trillion surplus in future years. So, if you look at the total deficit, you see how much money we would have if we had a balanced budget. That is $14.7 trillion. But this year, this President proposes a $6.6 trillion tax cut, a $12.6 trillion deficit. I say ``yes'' to a $12.6 trillion tax increase on a $20 trillion deficit, $1,000,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. But we can do that by enacting a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

Today we have the opportunity to come together as Members of the Congress of the United States to reauthorize and improve the Higher Education Act, as this country's primary source of postsecondary education.  During the last year, the legislation has become a model for bipartisan cooperation, and I applaud this record of accomplishment.  Now we are moving into the next part of the reauthorization process, a major piece of legislation, that will reauthorize the Higher Education Act, but it has been a long time coming.  It is very fitting, as we approach the anniversary of the Higher Education Act's inception, that we recognize a real milestone in this reauthorization, the passage of this bill by the House.  Congress passed a bipartisan Higher Education Act in 1965, and it was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson.  Just 2 years later, Congress passed the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1974 to reauthorize the Higher Education Act, and it was signed into law in 1974.  In the intervening 5 years, the two programs have been reauthorized dozens of times, and Congress has come together on a number of occasions to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.  The House passed this reauthorization bill by a unanimous vote of 373 to 18 in 1994

Senate Resolution 102 is an important resolution recognizing the contributions and success of the National Football League's Green Bay Packers. For more than 50 years, the Packers have captivated the American imagination. Their unselfish spirit is evident in the name of Green Bay, which conveys ``Green Bay.''  In 1942, the Green Bay Packers won their first championship when they played at Detroit's Met Life Stadium. Although at the time the Packers' victory over the Detroit Tigers was overshadowed by the fact that they had a more talented and skilled roster than the Tigers, it was still enough to send the team to the National Football League Championship.  After the Gold Medal had been awarded to the Green Bay Packers, it became the most popular team name in American professional sports, and it was also followed by the Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys and Kansas City Chiefs. The Packers' name is also a result of an especially auspicious event in 1916. On June 1, the Packers had not played a game yet, yet President Woodrow Wilson and his staff designated June 16, 1916, as ``Green Bay Packers Week.''  By the end of the year, the Green Bay Packers had amassed over 5,000 consecutive wins and the record for the longest active winning streak in the National Football League is over

Senator Brownback has been patient. I have been patient. You had that floor speech, and you are a freshman Senator from Wyoming. And I think you should be patient. You have been waiting for this week to see what you will get.  There was an article today that says that, by going into deficit and increasing taxes, the President of the United States has raised the deficit in his Presidency by $250 billion.  And when you look at what the Speaker of the House said, I am a conservative Democrat. But I agree with my conservative Democrat colleagues that you cannot have a balanced budget in America without having a balanced spending cut, without having a balanced budget amendment.  Now, what is the issue, you said you were trying to protect Medicare and the elderly, and I am from a State that has a real opportunity to protect and preserve Medicare and to preserve that program that is a part of our Social Security. It is in jeopardy because this President has voted to take that program and, instead, to put into his budget his own entitlement programs to make sure that he does not have the opportunity to pay for these programs, and they are to reduce.  So we have a very, very serious problem. And now is the time. I hope your patience

American families, our neighbors, have spoken loud and clear that they want a balanced approach to our country's energy policy, one that has a responsible price-of-oil approach. For a generation, we heard from our families, but many of us have heard them through the President's own economic adviser. Today, the oil and gas industry is at it again--and they are still at it.  The oil and gas industry's plans, revealed yesterday, are not what families are asking for, but the President's own Secretary of Energy said: ``These plans are not going to work.''  So the President has an alternative plan, the only real one, because what we need is responsible policy at the pump that reduces our dependence on foreign oil and moves us off our current consumption and into an abundance of domestic energy supplies and, I hope, domestic jobs that would create a decent living.

We promised the American workers that we were going to do this in a balanced way.  I am really excited to see this. This is something that will reduce that. I believe this can actually reduce the deficit by $40 billion. This is the biggest spending increase of all time. That is a big vote. But this is just one part of the package. This package is $500 billion worth of new entitlements, not just the debt. Now, $500 billion of that is in the middle class. The Medicare portion goes up, as do the new entitlements.

We are approaching 9:45. We have heard on our side that the chairman wants to conclude the debate at 9:45, and I am told that is accurate, but it would be an even further delay on the debate.  What this would do is, I think, is make it a lot more difficult for people who are involved in the research community to do their work. It will be the same thing that it is now. They are trying to get their studies done, but they are going to be held up on this for a week or 2 weeks. It will be very discouraging. It has been done before, and it is happening again.  I had a meeting with the chairman last night and we were all very frustrated about that, and we do not have the support for this.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3665, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1401 Main Street in St. Louis, Missouri, as the ``Gusty Trainor Post Office Building.''  Gusty Trainor was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on August 2, 1926. He was a graduate of St. Louis Central High School, St. Louis State University, and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where he was a member of the football team. After graduating from college, he attended the University of Missouri-Kansas City, where he was a member of the football team. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the first round of the 1947 NFL draft. He played for the Chiefs for 4 years, and was a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt).  
 the President is saying he wants to preserve Medicare. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the purpose of considering the following nominations: Calendar No. 471, Kathleen G. Saldana to be Surgeon General of the United States; Calendar No. 474, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Calendar No. 476, Stephen W. Barrett to be Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services; Calendar No. 478, P. Jared Taylor, to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Calendar No. 479, James M. Maram to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.  The

I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 810, the Strengthening the Security of the Internet Act. I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) for their hard work on this bill. I also want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for their hard work on this bill.  H.R. 810, the Strengthening the Security of the Internet Act, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will strengthen the security of the Internet.  First, H.R. 810 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan to protect the security of the Internet.  Second, H.R. 810 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan to protect the security of the Internet.  Third, H.R. 810 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan to protect the security of the Internet.  Fourth, H.R. 810 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a plan to protect the
Dear Senators: I rise today to offer an amendment which would simply transfer a portion of the $3.6 billion in unspent Defense Department funds to the ``Diesel Research and Development Fund'' (DRF).  The Defense Department's fiscal year 1997 funding request of $2.5 billion for the Diesel Research and Development Fund was substantially higher than the actual amount requested by the President. Because of the increased funding request, the DOD will now have the necessary funds to develop a $3.6 billion Diesel Research and Development Fund. To meet the authorized amount, the DOD would have to transfer $2.5 billion. The Department is now spending less than $2.6 billion, and since the DOD budget will be reduced in fiscal year 1998, it will still need to make a cut to this new authorized amount.  I believe we should allocate these funds to DRF research in the areas that are needed to maintain a high level of manufacturing and infrastructure in the diesel technology sector. I have cosponsored legislation which would transfer excess funding to this purpose. This amendment simply transfers $300,000 for the Diesel Research and Development Fund.  The amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. I urge support of the amendment.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 743, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2019.  Mr. Speaker, the right to organize is one of the most fundamental rights that we have as Americans. The right to organize is one of the most important freedoms that we have as Americans. It is one of the most fundamental rights that we have as Americans, and it is one of the most important freedoms that we have as a people.  The right to organize is one of the most important freedoms that we have as Americans.

I would say this to my friend, who has fought so hard on behalf of the people of his home State of Ohio, I am not going to belabor this issue, but I think it is important for us to have an understanding of the history and to realize that this amendment would, in fact, be more protective of the interests of small business in America, which I know we should have, as I said, in the past.  We hear a lot about the President and about the balanced budget. I do not think the President can balance the budget. I do not think the President can balance the budget unless he puts more money into it. I do not think the President can balance the budget unless he cuts back his own spending. But as long as he puts more money in the budget, as long as he spends more money in his budget than he takes out, we are in trouble.

amendment No. 2:  ``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.''  
Congressman Ruppersberger has, of course, been a staunch defender of our Nation's veterans and has been a champion of providing for the health, benefits and education of our veterans. I appreciate and join his constituents in making this very important speech, and we are looking forward to getting it out here in the House next week.

Mr. Speaker, last week the House of Representatives passed a landmark environmental reform bill that will take America in a new direction.  This is a bipartisan bill, and I want to thank my colleagues in the House and Senate for helping move it forward.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 2008 is the result of a strong bipartisan effort by six separate committees in the House.  The bill requires the EPA to have an open public comment period before rulemaking decisions are made.  In the past, we have restricted and delayed public comment for environmental regulations. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 2008 is a much more reasonable, transparent process, allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to provide fair consideration of all requests for regulatory relief. It is a great bill that will reduce our dependence on foreign sources of fossil fuels. The legislation also includes a significant improvement to the mercury and air toxics standard, a bill I introduced to give EPA more time to address this problem.  And finally, the Clean Water Amendments of 2008, which the House approved in a straight up-or-down vote, will improve our water resources by requiring the EPA to update its final rule to reduce arsenic, a well known environmental toxin.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot do anything if we don't think about what we
