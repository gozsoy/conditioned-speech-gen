The following is a speech by Harry Reid. This is a continuation of a lecture in New York City and is intended to share his thoughts about American foreign policy. He is deeply dedicated to improving our relationship with Europe. The opinions expressed in this lecture and other speeches are his own.

In 1963, President Lyndon Johnson took over the US and became the only United States to be able to invade Afghanistan. When he left, and became president of Vietnam, he offered to become a candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize. He did so by accepting the offer. The following year, he took over as President. As President, he would use the success of his former administration to try to reinvigorate the American security establishment in Vietnam and eventually the United States. As an ambassador, he was a pillar of the international community and was the face of America’s foreign policy in Vietnam. The following year, he became the Chairman of the Foreign Ministers Committee in the US Department of State and a prominent figure in the National Council on Foreign Relations. He left this office after a year in New York City.

This lecture was intended to discuss American foreign policy. He did not take responsibility for any such mistakes. His comments during the course of the lecture are as follows:

You will find the website for "New England Conservatism" on
the right-wing website of "American Conservatism."

In a long, sadder vein, I am not sure what you mean by "New England Conservatism".
There is no official "new" or "original" right wing blog, and this is not a
new, or any other conservative movement. Nor are there any official "New England Conservatism"
sites, nor any links to any of the "Original Right-Wing" and "New England Conservatism"
sites. This is a "New England Conservatism" blog, and this is not a "New England Conservatism"
 site. If you are not a fan of any of the "original right wing" sites, or any

“After 50 years of the same bloody campaign against what we have called “fake news”, I know I will never be able to explain myself to a woman.”

By

Neil Abercrombie

The world has been in a state of shock for over 60 years. I know this because I was in the midst of a campaign which was, in my view, going to try to scare the living daylights out of our society, and as such, it was in some ways a completely ineffective marketing campaign.

While there are many excellent books in the medical world that have dealt with the subject, the truth is that the media and politics do not have any of the usual excuses. We, as people, are a free country in a free world. What we are is simply a distorted media and politics propaganda campaign based upon an agenda which has been completely off target. We are, to put it in a different way, the kind of media we are.

In recent times, the mainstream media has been more active in helping governments and media personalities who do not want to pay a large debt to the governments who are doing what is being called �

The following is a speech by Harry Reid.  Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to thank President Sessions for his leadership on this issue and to mark the beginning of a new era.  Over the last 50 years of Congress, it has been a tradition for Senators to work together on policy issues. Senators have worked to ensure their constituents have their best interests at heart. Senators have worked to provide opportunities for Americans to learn, understand, and achieve important policy-making skills. For Senators like me, the task is to address a national security threat that is very complex.  Senators work to strengthen the security and power in the region to make sure our military, the economy, and our communities can protect our country from terrorist attacks. We need to support our efforts to invest more than $1 trillion in security in America.  We need to fund our military, our economy, our communities, and our country's resources. We need to strengthen our national defense and our military-industrial complex.  We need to invest and support our troops at home, in the air and sea, in our Nation's defense, and in our communities and the country's economy.

The following is a speech by Travis Childers.  I reserve the balance of my time.  I appreciate that the Chair has offered to listen to Senator Corker on the importance of protecting against the opioid epidemic.  The Senator says we must take more action on the bill before we come up with a stronger bill that is better for the country. I think Senator Corker will say that this bill is a product of politics.  I was pleased to have a Democratic amendment to pass and to vote for it; that is why we have an amendment that would block the implementation of an opioid law.  The Senator knows he will not veto the bill.  I also want to say that my comments are interesting because there is also the need to make our future programs better for people.  The Senator knows he will veto the opioid bill. So, the Senator has made an argument for not vetoing the bill, but we have not had an opportunity to work with that.  If I could just look into that argument, it would be a good vote for us to pass this bill.  I believe that this bill should not be blocked by an amendment to let us pass a stronger bill.  So I would like to thank the Senator for his remarks.

In the Senate, I have always said, ``The Senator from California is here. The Senator from California is here. The Senator from California is here. The Senator from California is here.'' So that was how I first came to the Senate. And, I believe, in fact, I had a dream to dream. I didn't know who it was that I was, but, I believe, I could do that because, of course, people were watching and watching and watching, and they were wondering how to spend their time, how to make the best of that, in terms of what we have here and what we have in terms of the opportunities for growth of that Senator, for those of us who might be part of that Senator, to grow, whether it is through this or the other Senators or the other Senators, for those of us who might be here and the other Senators, and, for those

The following is a speech by Harry Reid. I thank the gentleman for his extraordinary eloquence and comments, particularly on House leadership.  Mr. President, in the week following the House vote on November 7, Congress will pass the H.R. 2, ``The New American Jobs Act: How to Make America Jobs More Prosperous for Americans.'' It is time to begin voting, and I want to ask my colleagues who voted overwhelmingly to support the New American Jobs Act, the legislation's goal being to create jobs, improve our competitiveness, and, hopefully, create jobs for America's workers in this country.  The New American Jobs Act is a bill that will enable Americans to build, manufacture, and sell consumer products and service centers.  Americans and their families will benefit in a very simple and straightforward way, as the House votes to pass the bill, that it includes provisions to increase employment and create jobs for Americans who have been displaced by the U.S. Postal Service.  So it is an important step to pass, because it is something to which the American people will be most grateful.  Now, at a time of increased unemployment and rising cost, and I support raising the wage in this country, Americans deserve a well-deserved and sustainable improvement. We

I hope we can continue to work together and help each other with respect to the acquisition of our men and women in uniform.  For two years he has been a constant fighter for my country. He has been an invaluable asset to our Navy and military men in uniform and he has served as an invaluable adviser to the Secretary of the Navy.  He has earned the respect of our national security staff and has been a devoted cosponsor of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force. He is also a strong advocate for the Defense Department and has become a valued ally of our country. He has demonstrated the effectiveness and the leadership of our military. In 2007 he was chosen as Navy Secretary, and today is honored to serve as the Secretary of the Navy for the past 5 years.  I look forward to having him on my side and I will be supporting him

I just want to say a few things to the gentleman, but as I have discussed many times, my State is not the only one in America. There are some areas that are in trouble, and I think it is going to be up to us to get those solutions. But I also want to say we need to address the fact that, instead of focusing on health care reform, we are doing a very important job of improving the quality of care for the people of our Nation. We have put in place some of the first-ever health care reforms we have been hearing on the floor, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. I think the American people want to see how this reform will work and where we can improve it for our Nation.  It is a good bill that we will get on the House floor for over a year. We will be discussing it, and we can put in place some of the first-ever health care reform

The following is a speech by Gokberk Ozsoy.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3614, the Reauthorization of Financial Policing Act of 2015, which would remove the United States' ability to act unilaterally in a way that respects the laws that apply to these and other areas of our national security.  The bill, introduced by Chairman Baucus of the House and Senator Grassley, would place the U.S. in a period of global crises, focusing on threats emanating from China and other critical nations, including Iran. The bill also would eliminate the role of the Federal Reserve in the U.S. government's conduct of security-related operations.  This legislation would allow us to remove our jurisdiction over financial sanctions, including those relating to financial mismanagement, including the use of foreign banks to lend money to those designated as financial advisers.  Mr. Chairman, I want to say this week that I have been to the United States in support of H.R. 3614, a bipartisan piece of legislation that I had before and was supported by the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and was introduced by Senator Enzi of Ohio.

Do you think it is about the American people's privacy? If so, we are going to have to go to the American people and talk about that, and that is about having an opportunity to engage with the American people--to engage with the American people that I think this was about.

The following is a speech by Richard Durbin. I appreciate my colleague from Oklahoma.  We have had a bipartisan bill introduced today to reauthorize the Food Stamp program in Nebraska. This is very important because it is an essential part of our food supply chain. It has been the case for two decades, and in the last decade, it has been clear that it is the most successful program to provide food for people in my district.  The American people have heard my case. I am hopeful we can come up with something here. We have good ideas, but we need to have good ideas.  There is a bipartisan bill that would require the Food Stamp Program to fund its operations to get it through the law. We will be joined by the majority whip this afternoon and my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  What is interesting is that there is bipartisan agreement in the legislation, which I strongly support, so I support the idea.  It is also about nutrition. One of the things we all know is that for every dollar a person contributes, if they are to a new nutrition assistance program, $1,000 a year is a lot of food. One of the things that the food stamp program needs is money from the taxpayers. That is why it

It was a small business in California, and the number of jobs it had was at the small business, and they were at the great San Juan Preferences. One of the biggest business owners in our community was the famous giant Levi Strauss.  The small business owner from San Juan, California, a man named Pete, worked at the Levi Strauss, and in all those parts of San Juan, and in the San Juan Preferences he had gone to meet the man in blue and called his first customer. But he met him.  There was a young fellow named Sam, and they had lunch in the little bar, and Sam walked up to the door and asked for Sam. And they went down to the little place where the people were and asked to have Sam in a suit and go in and get him. And Sam, who was sitting there, and a man named Mike was going to get him.

I have been here more than a year. I do not think that is even close to the mark. As the Senator from Oklahoma stated, the bill passed the House this morning, but it is not even close to the mark. I don't think the Senator would object.  As the Senator from Oklahoma said, we have spent too much time in the budget. The budget is going to be much more than just a one-page mark. The bill does much more than one-page mark. The CBO did this, and it does much more than one-page mark.  The Budget Control Act is something that actually has a lot of implications on how we will spend the deficit and what the future look like, and what this Congress is about in the way we do budget and what we do now.

In 1974, George joined the military, which was based in Fort Campbell, Texas. Although he lived in the Dallas County Chamber of Commerce, I was not drawn to his business.

He has been very cooperative with us. I thank him for all his work and appreciate his willingness to listen to the concerns of constituents.  I am grateful to my colleague and good friend, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, for his very important and careful work and for his support and cooperation. I know it is hard to imagine that as a Congressman, that you have had more hearings, that you have had more hearings in this Congress.  I know our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have had some disagreements. They share some of the same concerns. I thank them.  In this instance, they would have to be satisfied with the input of our constituents, our elected representatives, the representatives of our people on this committee. That is part of the reason we are here today. We are here to set a goal here. Our goal should not be to work on a bill that has gone through this committee, in this committee, in the past. We should be focused on meeting those objectives and moving this legislation forward.  I thank the ranking member for his tremendous work on

The following is a speech by Gokberk Ozsoy.  The gentleman from Texas is correct that there are two different approaches to the problem. The first approach would simply say, if you're going to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, that means, if you're going to be replaced with something more efficient, that means, that you have to come up with a new way to make this thing work, so if you get rid of the health care law, you have to take a little bit of a new set of tools for this Congress, and in the meantime, you can work it out for people who have a different type of health care plan.  But a second approach is something you could work out for your employees. If you're going to say, I'll keep my insurance, my coverage, I'll keep my pay-as-you-go plan, and then you can just say you can get rid of that, in a few months, and if you can't pay that money for that kind of health care, that means you're going to get a big big big bill.  There are things that you can work out, and it's about taking an employee's proposal, and using all of those different tools, and getting rid

The gentleman from Oregon has been relentless in his pursuit of bringing forward a bill that will create jobs, that will make that happen.  I thank him for his comments, but I think he's just misinformed about the facts.  Let me say this again: I think most of the people in my district, for many of these reasons, do want to have their jobs taken care of. But at the same time, there's a clear problem. Because there are many who would argue that the President should not take the job responsibility of the Federal Government--he should not take a job responsibility--for those who are leaving the Federal Government, the number of people whose jobs are being taken care of, and the number of people who have to go to the States to see their family, to keep their kids in school, to keep their family's house and keep the lights running, and for that reason they are looking at this.  One of the reasons that the President does so is that it's necessary to save the Nation. He must do that.  But one thing we can do right now is make sure that it

The question I have been waiting to ask in regard to this resolution is whether or not there are sufficient issues that would be dealt with in the Congressional Review of Sexual and Political violence Legislation.  The answer to that question is no. I have been waiting for a month to ask an open and constructive question that comes to me and others on the Armed Services Committee and to say that the administration, Congress, the Congress of the United States, are the only ones who have asked and are standing behind the defense bill.  It is hard to take action if you are not in a position to make the determination you will want to make. I have said repeatedly. I have been here to make the necessary decisions to have the House of Representatives, the Senate, have hearings to make those decisions. I have made those decisions because I thought the President, the President of the United States, should have a say in the oversight process for this bill, this legislation, and, as we saw here today in the Capitol, we would not need it in the House of Representatives.

It appears that the majority of our Republican friends on the other side of the aisle have somehow chosen to continue to insist on that we continue to fund the wall.  Our Republican friends are on the other side of the aisle saying, hey, this is about the wall, and I guess we are on to the next wall, so we are talking about it, and we are in the middle of it.  We are on to that, the majority. They are going to continue to insist on it, and the minority continues to insist that we continue to fund the wall. It seems to me it looks like the majority, especially in their Republican friends, are saying, hey, let's just take a look at the people who voted for this. Let's just keep spending money, we are spending money, and we will continue to do that.  It appears, for the majority, that the majority will continue to insist on this continuing resolution that is going to do this. In other words, what the majority of the country actually agrees on, what we have to stop is what the majority of the American people agreed

The following is a speech by Travis Childers.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Hastert amendment, which would prevent the Federal Government from receiving its tax benefit under ObamaCare. The bill would not have prevented these abuses even if a doctor had operated on him for a preexisting condition.  The bill also prevents HHS from imposing on providers the new responsibility for the management and counseling of patients, the authority for doctors and their staff to treat patients with preexisting conditions, and the ability to provide quality care for individuals with a preexisting condition. The bill would force providers to disclose this new responsibility if they would provide care to patients with a preexisting condition. This is simply not working. The bill would cut benefits for individuals with a preexisting condition.  So there is one more reason to oppose the amendment and ask my colleagues to stop blocking the amendment and stop funding to help Americans with preexisting conditions.  I also want to thank my colleague, Mr. Ryan, for bringing this forward to get this debate on healthcare back on the record.

I want to thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut for yielding time to me.  The gentlewoman is from Connecticut. She had a seat on the subcommittee chairwoman for the committee. She understands her district. She understands our Nation's needs. We understand the issue as it relates to health care, but the facts are as follows:  ObamaCare--the ObamaCare's biggest loophole--was put in place in 1997      when ObamaCare was passed, but that's under the law. As      well as for any regulation, that wasn't put in place before      1997. In 1997, this law was broken, and that's the reason for      this: because ObamaCare was an attack on small businesses--      that was what this was.       I don't think we should be making decisions as to how we      pay for health insurance, how we pay for the Affordable      Health Insurance Program, how we pay for the Federal health

As I see it, it is unfortunate that I must oppose the resolution offered by a committee of my own. There is an issue in the State of California that is well known to the Members of Congress and to all who work in the community as a consequence of a flawed implementation of the California Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which imposes severe penalties on the mining companies for allowing permits to be issued to private parties to mine water off the California coast, and impose harsh penalties on those who have had their permits revoked or not renewed until they are certain they are going to be able to use their wells within the California State's water boundaries.  In May of 2011, my friend, Representative Kevin Brady, co-chair of the Congressional Long-Term Future Caucus, introduced the California Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, which requires the companies that would be allowed to mine water off the coast of California and across the State in the areas they are seeking to have water in, and we in the States that we have an opportunity to have our own water and have our own drinking water,

The following is a speech by Mitch McConnell. The Senator is absolutely correct, and I agree with him. It is the same old story.  The President was a President of a country in which he was a man of principle. He asked us to put him in a position where he would be willing to do whatever we wanted to do with the opportunity to work with his colleagues. I did not oppose him, and I don't see that we needed more Democratic votes.  I also don't think it is fair to suggest that there is any disagreement about the President. I do not think that his remarks were in violation of the law, his words were not used in violation of the law, and his actions, even his actions in his first term, when he was in the majority, may not have been consistent with that position, but that doesn't make him in any way different than any other President, and if you think that any Senator--any Senator--in the history of the country, including the Senator from Tennessee or the Senator from Ohio, who has had these policies since we are still in a period of 4 years of President Reagan, we have to be careful that we do not try to get it wrong.

There has been some criticism. I didn't take that very seriously. I thought it was nice that we had these numbers in the Congressional Record. But I think it was very obvious that some people were still scratching their heads. There were a lot of good people down at the United Steelworkers.  In fact, one of the issues with the amendment is that it just says, ``Workforce Recognition Act.'' What it says, if this does not work, is that the committee report and that you have to include in your plan. So we have to be sure to include the provisions that help the members of the Congress to have access to the best solutions and, hopefully, to get some real access to the work they need to do and, hopefully, the same as those who are providing some of those individuals with their benefits--all the benefits that the employer that they're giving back to the people that they've worked for. That's really what they were doing.  So I don't know that we're in the minority anymore,

I thank the chairwoman, Representative Himes for taking the time to work with me and to colead on this important issue of women's health and the issues of the time that we are considering in the House today.  I was pleased to see the bill included in the Energy and Commerce Committee's agenda as well as the women's health and child care bill. This bill is a product of these efforts, as Mr. Garamendi mentioned, which has resulted in the repeal of the Affordable Care Act.  As we are all so familiar with, this was the most extreme assault on women's health and the ability of our health system to support the fight for a woman's health. This bill is all about preserving that women's health and providing for the health of those around them. It is about protecting women's health and providing for the health of the American people who have lived and will live with a healthy, prosperous woman.

Our friends in this body are asking the question: Where is the future of our Earth? The answer to that question is never there.  In the past 40 years, we have seen the destruction of the Earth by a global warming and climate change. It has been a horrific and brutal act. And not only for our Nation, but for the world and our planet. It has been the subject of many of our most heated debates. But it is now time for us to put the issue back in the arena of science, in the arena of our own destiny.  So if you have heard of the climate change debate, it has been called the climate debate. The climate debate is a major debate. We have spent an enormous amount of time talking about science. I know there are many Americans in my State who have questions about climate change. Some ask: Are we going to do everything we can to reduce the carbon that we put out into the atmosphere to save space? You bet.  Climate change is a global challenge.

The following is a speech by Gokberk Ozsoy. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this week, I came to the floor and spent a week with my constituents in Turkey, and they know I have great respect for the people of Turkey, especially the young men and women who come here for a reason.  Now, I was not at the hearing, but the Turks have a special obligation to their country, and I am very concerned about the continued presence of a variety of religious groups and some very disturbing things that have occurred in Turkey over the years.  The fact that the Turkish government does not provide the funding for medical attention or treatment of the wounded or the sick is an insult to the nation of Turkey. This has to stop.  I do not support the government of Turkey, nor do I support its attempts to extend aid to those in Turkey.  I am a proud new Member of this body, and I believe we can have a reasonable and sensible debate in this institution on the issues of Turkey and Turkey-Turkey relations. We have seen this before.  The American people want to see this Turkey stand strong. Let's stand together on the issues of Turkey and Turkey-Turkey relations.

We are having a bipartisan agreement with respect to the Keystone XL Pipeline. I am just very happy to be here on the floor again as we are continuing to work together. I do not want to have to choose sides.  It is a great bipartisan agreement. I think most of us agree that the administration has done its job. But we see a lot of talk that indicates that the administration is very concerned with the jobs and with our tax base. I just think it should be said for our country. But this has got to stop. This is not about jobs. It is about our economy.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Republican leader on his bill, which is the Keystone bill. And this bipartisan agreement is good for the American people, good for America's middle class, good for American families and great for our country.  I hope we can continue this discussion today and hope for a productive next Congress.  I yield the floor.  The

The following is a speech by Neil Abercrombie.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Fair Pay for Employer Act of 2015.  I want to thank the chair and ranking member of the Budget Committee and the subcommittee for their support in the short time I have spent in this area, and also the chairman and ranking member for the rest of the year, Mr. Hastings, Mr. McCaskill, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Holt, Mr. Grijalva, and all our committee members.  These men and women have sacrificed everything they have been to the cause of our country.  The Fair Pay for Employer Act of 2015, to name a few, gives the payee of a factory or an employer, the opportunity to make the same payments as a full-time employee to employees who receive lower wages and to reduce their costs, but this is not just about just a handful of employees; this is all about companies, unions, and workers.  The Fair Pay for Employer Act requires that employers disclose their payee on how much it costs the company to provide it. When the employers don't disclose, the corporations and labor unions, as we are all aware, are responsible to take that money from the corporations

Mr. Conyers and I will certainly be glad to be glad to be able to work with him to find some sort of a bipartisan solution. But, as my friend from Maryland has said, in fact, that we could actually vote to raise the debt ceiling and pass a budget this year, that it could be very, very difficult for this country to accomplish anything.

The following is a speech by Gokberk Ozsoy.  Mr. Speaker, as we head into the final days of this Congress, we must ensure that the Senate passes a permanent solution to the budget crisis we face. Last week, the House voted to give the President his full funding. However, despite this fact, the President has not given his administration the full fiscal year 2019 budget resolution, meaning this fiscal year will expire.  This is not surprising to most of us. President Trump has failed to address the enormous economic challenges facing our country. He has failed to act to address the needs of millions of hardworking Americans. His failure to act on the deficit will have devastating consequences on our economy, our infrastructure, and our health care system. We must act now, and we need to do so in the strongest possible terms.  This Congress cannot afford to default on the debt, and this budget gimmick would allow Washington to continue to be in charge of deficit spending, and that includes tax cuts that will boost the economy and reduce the deficit if we fail to act on the debt limit.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the budget.

The gentleman from New Jersey is correct that there are a few bills that were passed back in 2012 which would actually prohibit women from wearing their birth control products if they are overweight or obese.  But what the Senate bill does not do is prohibit women from using contraception. We have a provision, as the gentleman knows, called the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which the Senate has passed and included in the package, that prohibits women from using any of their own bodies as a reason for having abortions, to the extent that their health or safety considerations would be affected.  I wish to make a quick comment on the Pregnancy Discrimination Act because the Federal Government subsidizes health benefits, but the Republicans filibustered, and the Federal Government provides abortions.  Now the problem is that the health and safety requirements of the Federal Government are no longer supported by Republicans and that the President continues to refuse to sign the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which is an appropriation bill.  We are debating the House version of this bill because we are considering a House bill that includes the Federal subsidy. That is not an appropriation bill, and the Federal Government subsidizes abortion, which is no longer supported

The following is a speech by Richard Durbin. The following exchange occurs in connection with the Republican Conference's conference report: The President of the Senate, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Lieberman, on February 9, the Senate approved the Defense authorization bill, and both the Senate Democrats and the President of the United States sent the final version of the bill to the floor of the Senate. The Senate Democrats and the President, at no time after the Senate did the final version of the bill have sent a letter to both the House and the Senate, in which the House majority leader suggested that they would be open for debate and that a vote on the floor of the House be postponed. The Senate Democrats sent the final version of the bill to the floor of the House to offer amendments. If the amendment is adopted, all that we will do is to close the debate and vote on the amendments. The amendment process is, therefore, open to amendments. However, the House has not sent a letter or offered a letter to either the Senate or the House of Representatives on any measure of disapproval of the Senate amendment, in which case the House does not send a letter. The majority leader, apparently determined that this was a bad situation to have a second set of amendments--anybody in

The following is a speech by Neil Abercrombie.  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, my amendment would make permanent the designation of the facility in China as the ``Museum of Foreign Property in China.''  China is no stranger to being a cultural center. Its rich artistic diversity and economic prosperity depend on its wealth and cultural identity being maintained by its intellectual, cultural, and commercial contributions.  I support this amendment because, at the end of the day, China is an international free market that relies on a very limited degree of free trade and respect for the rights and privileges of the Chinese people.  Over time, China has been a strong supporter of free trade and a strong supporter of U.S. global leadership.  China has been a strong supporter of trade and a strong supporter of U.S. leadership in the international arena, even as it has been heavily involved in international human rights abuses, like the Vietnam War.  China's success in modernizing the world trade system has driven its share of high-wage jobs across China, making it even more important for workers to have safe, reliable access to their products.  In the past few years, however, China has made good on its

The following is a speech by Travis Childers. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I think it is appropriate that we address this in the last couple of minutes.  Mr. Speaker, it was our intention to address the topic of the health care reform bill, the health care reform legislation. I want to speak for a moment about the title of this legislation, and it is the same title that was first brought to the floor in the debate last year. We heard that, before, that title had been proposed a decade ago, a decade ago.  It is important to point out, however, that the legislation before us today is just a different bill. This bill is a step in the right direction forward. It helps ensure that consumers have health care coverage they are getting. It brings in a number of good provisions, as well, such as an opportunity to give people access to a quality health insurance, to ensure that people can take care of themselves, and to make sure that people have adequate time to care for themselves and to be able to have access to an affordable health care.  We all understand and want our insurance companies to have greater confidence in the quality of their products and services and have better competition. We all understand and want to ensure that, by

The following is a speech by Gokberk Ozsoy. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize and thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Zuker) for his service to the House of Representatives.  I rise in opposition to the rule and the legislation. This amendment would cut $20 million from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by removing one program, the Program for Outstanding Student Loan Programs.  In 2009, the Federal Government requested that roughly $5 billion be cut from the program by the Department of Education. Under current law, the Department of Education's proposed cut will include at least $150 million in new funding from programs like the National Institute of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.  That cut alone would not affect any college graduates and, thus, would not have any impact on the budget of the Federal Government. Rather, the proposed cuts would cause an average of one every 12 seconds.  We must continue to pay attention to these issues. Rather than using the cuts proposed to cut SNAP for someone who needs to graduate with a disability, we should instead take steps to restore existing benefits, such as reduced premiums, even though the Federal Government may be cutting benefits, without actually taking an additional cut.  As the President has mentioned, SNAP benefits are

The gentlelady from Maine has raised a simple question: If you get a hold of a person who gets a hold of a certain TV camera or radio broadcast or something like that, you can't use it as a permanent record of you and your performance, it can't be used as an ad for the program in the commercial or any other media for whatever reason?  The gentleman may be saying that there are people who want to participate, but there are a host of other things that are happening now, which is quite a collection of these programs that you don't see, but you can't really tell the story of what happened at the show, what we did with the broadcast, what the content was, or the commercials that were distributed.  With that, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of Washington (Mr. Hultgren).  Mr. HULTgren. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.

And it is not because the tax cuts do not have any effect, as a Republican, or a Democrat. It is because these cuts, if implemented, will cost this economy over a decade of record growth, and we should not be subsidizing Wall Street and then going home to the taxpayers who will be paying $900 billion for this debt.

In these times, it is the goal of healthcare providers to help individuals with rare and life-threatening diseases get the treatment they need so that they can stay healthy and heal their families and communities.  Today, I will be speaking on the health and well-being of our young men and women with rare and life-threatening diseases that are affecting them, like cancer or diabetes.

I said before the Judiciary Committee, the committee that has jurisdiction over this is going to get up to a committee that has jurisdiction over the FDA-approved generic drugs in a bipartisan way. It is the Senate, and we will be glad to try to work with them.  But I don't think we should continue to make this the Senate's top priority. This bill isn't. I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The

I rise today in support of a rule that we passed last month, and, yes, that we are still fighting to keep those promises to the American people that the House will do its part in closing Guantanamo Bay and providing adequate surveillance.  I just had a look at a number of the top five detainees that were held in Guantanamo Bay, of which there is not one. One of them was a detainee from Guantanamo Bay, Lieutenant General Charles David Zeng, and a number of others, and they were held in the United States. They were held in Guantanamo Bay.  Let me say to my colleagues, I really have no problem with that. I really do. We have been working to provide the law and the due process to the President and Attorney General. As we have had progress in having these classified annexes--especially, as the President has asked for, I think it has been one of the most productive time of the year in my career--I really think it is important that they have those things attached to them.

I would just like to be able to say, Mr. Speaker, that the gentlelady from Maryland (Mrs. Edwards) and I are very concerned by this bill. There is no requirement that the Federal Government provide these benefits. That means that people in my district need to be able to rely on this program for economic recovery and for creating jobs that will help the economy.

The Speaker's budget would reduce Medicare and Social Security and would force seniors to pay more for their doctors.  It would do this on the backs of more than 25 million people.  We know this Medicare budget is an attack on America's health care system. That is not why the Republican budget failed to pass in the Senate, but we know what it was that failed to pass in the House. We know it is an attack on seniors, seniors, and seniors, which is the only difference between our two votes.  Medicare provides some relief to the elderly. If you are the last patient at age 65, you should be able to take your medicine, get your checkup, and see if there is a prescription. You should be able to see if there is a change, because the seniors in my district are taking medicine that is on the wrong side of the checkup line.  Now, seniors are paying into the Medicare program. We should be able to see if there is a prescription for Medicare. We should not be forced to pay more for an older patient

You know, if this bill is not brought to your attention, I would hope that when this amendment is brought to your attention, you would say: If it was brought to my attention, I would just call in to Congress and, as I might suggest, that we should look at that bill, and that's the issue before us.

I wanted to mention the most important thing I will say is the President has said that he has made some things in the budget that we should be able to take a look at, but the President has made certain that we don't waste the money, and that is for the health care.  The budget we are voting on today today makes great sense. It has all kinds of things to do, but it is going to require a lot of work, and we are very disappointed in the President. We are disappointed in the Senator from Oklahoma who said we ought to do a budget. We have a number of things we ought to do in the budget because the President is the one who is the most able. We have passed his budget by a very wide margin.  I have a number of things that need to be done. One of them is the Budget Control Act of 2010, which I strongly supported and have been very happy to work with. It should have had a balanced approach to this issue but one

The following is a speech by Travis Childers. I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.  I would like to thank the gentleman from New York for hosting this Special Order hour tonight. I would also like to thank Chairman Walden and the other chairmen of the subcommittee staffs for their support of this important bill.  I rise today to highlight a bill which has been pending since March of last year. This is the Water Resources Development Act, and it has not been enacted by a majority of the States that passed it.  The Water Resources Development Act includes important resources for all residents of our country. It provides funding for over 1,400 areas in my State, such as the East Coast and the Chesapeake Bay.  The West Coast is the largest region of water resources in the country. It accounts for over 9,000 acres of watersheds. It is also home to more than 90 percent of the States that develop their own water supplies.  That is because of the water that flows from the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay provides vital drinking water for our country. In the West, it is one of the primary harbors for our Nation's water supply. It is one of the largest reservoirs on the face of the planet.  The Bay has a

Madam Speaker, the Department of Health and Human Services does work to support patients and families in its work to make sure that the care that they need is available to them at all costs.  This legislation provides $18 billion in Federal funding for the DSH and $1.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health. This funding provides essential health benefits and funding to prevent and treat diseases.  Our country is a stronger place to live, work, and learn and a healthier world is one that the Senate has established, and we can continue to work to provide more funding for our medical research and treatment programs.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the portion of this letter which I sent to the House on behalf of myself and my colleagues.

Mr. Chairman, this amendment would protect taxpayer dollars, and certainly the health of our Nation, from being diverted to the illicit sale of natural gas. If this amendment passes, the money would go to the EPA and they would be able to set an arbitrary boundary around their proposed cap at 200 miles from our national border. The EPA is under no obligation to pay for those funds to the tune of millions of dollars, and it would also be a violation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules that prevent the EPA from paying the cost of running their cap on gas at the rate it would.  If this amendment is not adopted, I would point out that this language that was included in the underlying bill actually requires the EPA to meet its regulatory responsibility, and that is exactly what the gentleman from Colorado is requesting.  Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.

The following is a speech by Mitch McConnell. I was necessarily absent for the vote on the confirmation of Robert J. Lynn, of Utah, to be Secretary of the Department of Agriculture.  Mr. REID. I will now yield for a question.  As the Democratic leader said on the previous morning, the President's nominee for Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Lynn, is going to make a big impact for the farmers who rely on the very critical assistance that he brings to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  I voted for Mr. Lynn's nomination on November 17.  Before I speak to the merits of Mr. Lynn's nomination, I will provide some background.  On January 19, 2007, I was a Member of the Natural Resources Committee in Washington, DC, on a series of occasions during the 112th Congress. I was in the White House with my staff back home, and was asked to come down and discuss the nomination. Unfortunately, Mr. Lynn's first session as Secretary of Agriculture in the Obama administration was short-lived and, in fact, ended with the Republican President's failure to sign on to the bipartisan farm bill with an overwhelmingly favorable vote.  On April 2, 2007, I was absent. On April 5

This is a simple but important amendment. It will require a study, by using a pilot program, of extreme weather events that impact our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the Office of the U.S. Meteorological Service to NOAA, April 4, 2009, regarding the analysis by the Department of Commerce of the National Weather Service of the impact of extreme weather events on our State.

The following is a speech by Travis Childers. I thank the ranking member for yielding.  I rise today to offer my congratulations to Dr. Charles A. Coughlin, who passed away this week after a courageous battle with prostate cancer.  When you think about it, a lot of people refer to Dr. Coughlin as ``the father of prostate cancer.'' I am sad to say that I never took him seriously. He was a fine and conscientious physician who made the best medical decisions for me and my family. He left a great legacy, and we will remember the positive impact that he had on our community and our entire Nation.  At the age of 24, he would step into a car and leave a life of hard work and selfless service and be part of the people who would follow him.  We will miss him greatly.  His commitment to public service and to serving others was unmatched, and his work for people like David Ogden, his wife Bonnie, and his three sons has made him an outstanding colleague and friend.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Dr. Charles Coughlin for being recognized as an honor and for leading this very important fight for justice and for giving back to those who helped them

The following is a speech by Travis Childers. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the President has recently acknowledged that the U.S. economy is in its worst shape in decades and that Congress must act to address that crisis.  For the past few weeks, President Trump has been taking the lead on spending as it relates to health care, while Congress must fulfill its constitutional responsibilities. I think this is a very important bill because the President's fiscal policy has already contributed to the deficit.  The President's fiscal policy also has consequences. According to CBO, as the Congressional Budget Office estimates, according to which the President will raise taxes, in order to balance the budget, taxes on the American people will go up, so the President's budget deficit will double, according to CBO.  Additionally, according to the National Federation of Independent Business, according to the National Association of Federal Employees, it will reduce the ability of small business owners to hire new people. According to the National Association of Federal Contractors, it will cut the number of workers coming to the United States for every job search.  And according to an analysis by the National Association of Counties, according to the National Association of Realtors, it will cut the total

The following is a speech by Gokberk Ozsoy. I would like to thank the gentleman from Iowa for the time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan passage of H.R. 7. The need to protect American jobs is just one more reason why the President should call it the trade policy, the trade bill.  This bill will help increase productivity and increase our exports by helping to create a more competitive global economy.  The trade bill is a commonsense trade policy that ensures that American workers are protected from unfair trade practices, in keeping with the American Dream. And there's a reason why trade promotion authority has become so significant to the country.  First, it provides relief for a growing number of Americans, from manufacturing jobs and exports, who are stuck in their jobs when this administration decides to pursue a trade policy that forces American companies to cut exports and trade to American workers. It allows for those American workers who are working full-time or part-time to enjoy the same opportunities they have earned during the private sector's so-called ``factory shift.''  That's right, the trade adjustment assistance for manufacturing jobs, which helps to fill American jobs, is being expanded by this bill and to the

The following is a speech by Travis Childers. I rise in support of H.R. 1350, a bill that honors the memory of Sergeant Daniel Davis of Hot Springs County, Texas, a fallen hero.  Sergeant Davis was born on August 12, 1925, in Hot Springs, Texas. He enlisted in the United States Army in November 1943, and entered the United States Army as a first-class general in the F Company. He was assigned to a 2-man company; a squad of second-class and squad commanders; and a company commander.  On December 10, 1945, Sergeant Davis was deployed to the South China Sea and landed in Lubeck, China, where he met with Chinese marines. While there, he was wounded in the stomach and was laid to rest by the members of the Lubeck Marine Company. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor.  Sergeant Davis died on February 3, 1960, from wounds received during a mortar round. He was 81 years old. His memorial service was held in Arlington National Cemetery.  The Davis family says that it is their memory that bestows them the most honors and supports.

The following is a speech by Richard Durbin.  Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment on the recent unanimous consent request by the majority leader.  Yesterday, Senator Merkley came to the floor to introduce the so-called Keystone Pipeline Act. This legislation would add to the already-existing pipeline infrastructure by imposing new barriers to oil exports that protect American consumers.  The Keystone pipeline has already been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has previously approved the pipeline through the State of Texas. The State approved the pipeline through Arkansas and Tennessee. The States have already approved the Keystone pipeline, and the President is acting on a request that would protect the American public from a second oil spill.  Today, let me state that the Keystone Pipeline Act does not apply to this legislation.  The pipeline is a 1,500-mile, 7-lane, 35-mile pipeline, and does not have to have a major flaw or environmental impact. The pipeline is constructed in the middle of an oil field of 5 million gallons of oil per year, and there are three major infrastructure projects--roads, pipelines, dams--all of which will help our national security and our economic security.  At a minimum, the Keystone Pipeline Act would protect the American

H.R. 2200, introduced by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt), would designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 910 N. Main Street in New Castle, New Jersey, as the William J. Post Office Building.  William J. Post Office Building is the oldest post office building in the United States.

The following is a speech by Travis Childers. I am a small business owner and an employee of the State of Texas. I know I am not alone.  The reason why I continue to support the House Small Business Committee, and the reason why I am supporting this amendment is because I can see the power of small business owners to innovate and create jobs.  Now, this doesn't mean a perfect small business. A recent study found that only 16 percent of all small business owners use their credit cards as a form of payment. The most recent study found that only 14 percent of employees have either a smartphone or a tablet. A lot of times, an employee doesn't need to worry about how they will use the Internet. It can be a huge hassle to send a check in the mail.  So small business owners who think they will invest in their employees' jobs are not the type of person who can really invest in their careers and put money back into their own family.  The bill we are considering, H.R. 5737, is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will help keep the government in place and help create new jobs.  I would be willing to consider the House bill if it was a good idea, but I believe it is not.
