Neil Abercrombie. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my support for this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 2727, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, and I applaud Chairman Levin for introducing this legislation.  H.R. 2727 would have created the Office of Drug Administration Control of the Food and Drug Administration. This legislation would have restored the Office of Drug Administration Control and, in turn, the FDA's activities designed to protect drugs from human trafficking.  We all know that the human trafficking crisis has been a challenge, but there is a solution. Over the last 100 years, the Federal Government has done a lot of work, many times, on the safety of drugs. It takes a lot of work to ensure that patients and their families have adequate access to the drugs they can use for their health care needs.  Congress could not do it alone. Unfortunately, we have a bipartisan group of Senators who seek to take the FDA's important mission seriously. Over the last year, the FDA has worked hand in glove to make sure that these drugs in their user's market are safe, effective, and useful. We need better safeguards for drug abuse, and our committee has done very well with the help of the
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota, Mr. Daines, for the good thoughts and leadership of the community and the Hoosier community in Minnesota.  I include in the Record a letter from the American Association of State Legislatures, expressing support for the rule and the underlying bill and expressing support for the continued expansion of the National Guard and National Guard's role in serving Hoosiers. Please accept letters from my colleagues on the gentleman's and the gentlelady's respective committees.  Washington, DC, June 30, 2010.     Hon. Paul Ryan,     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Ryan: I would like to thank you for your      invitation to join me in sponsoring H.R. 3590, the National      Guard and Military Assistance Act. H.R. 3590, which will      strengthen the National Guard and National Guard and the      National Guard's role in serving Hoosiers, is a bipartisan      proposal that was introduced by my colleague Mr. Daines of   
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the recess there be 2 hour-long votes on the nomination of Robert E. Lee, of Alabama, to be Assistant Secretary of Labor; that each hour of these votes be 10 minutes each; that there be 4 minutes to 2 minutes each equally divided evenly prior to the adjournment of the next hour; that following morning business, the Senate resume consideration of the nomination of Robert E. Lee, of Alabama, to be Assistant Secretary of Labor; that all postcloture time be equally divided in the usual form prior to the adjournment of the first half. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 3 p.m., with the exception of the morning business vote, be equally divided prior to the adjournment of the last half of the session of the Senate.  The 
Mitch McConnell. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 611, as amended, the bill that is before us today, with the exception of the Senate amendment to the amendment offered by Mr. Thune, which I previously offered, and with the exception of the Senate amendment to this second measure, be withdrawn; that any further amendments to the bill be considered in order on H.R. 611. I further ask that the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 611 and that the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the amendment not offered by Mr. Thune; that a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive the requirements for a motion to waive both the motions to
Joseph Heck. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment. If we are to accept what the gentlelady does, it would be inappropriate for the House to do so in the absence of a Senate amendment. It would be an attack on our amendment process.  This bill would weaken the committee's oversight of Federal funds. It would weaken the oversight of the Federal Government by requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to submit quarterly reports to the Congress detailing the effectiveness and performance of the Treasury's budget.  I have heard my colleagues talk about the need for these, and again with respect to this amendment, I disagree. The Treasury has a $1.5 trillion budget, and this is the size of it, and it is why we should fund the Federal Government in other ways.  I urge my colleagues to act now, and I hope my colleagues will act on that understanding and on that understanding.  I yield back the balance of my time.

Neil Abercrombie. I would love to yield to the gentleman from California.  
Travis Childers. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service of Col. William John Young, who passed away on June 20, 2012, at the age of 81.  His life's work, work ethic, passion, and vision as a police officer led the United States to become the first African American full-service law enforcement officer in history.  Col. Young was a strong advocate for African American and South African immigrants, particularly young people, who had lived and fought both in the past and in our Nation since the Civil War.  Col. Young was a dedicated public servant who also served as an officer in the New York City Police Department and as a member of the Police Academy.  He was a dedicated public servant who contributed a positive life, which he instilled in a vast generation of citizens all across our country.  Col. Young was also recognized by the Nation as a highly deserving fellow in the NAACP. He was an extraordinary attorney who had a lifetime of experience.  I am saddened that we must continue to mourn the loss of one such outstanding police officer, one of the bravest and most dedicated Americans I have had the honor of knowing. I ask the House, please please please close this closed prayer.  I want
Harry Reid. Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 308, S. 1821.  The 
Mitch McConnell. Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 447.  The 
Joseph Heck. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Yarmuth for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a woman of great renown who has dedicated her life to advancing the cause of freedom and liberty for the American people.  Helen Harwell of Bangor, Washington, is a devoted and devoted wife, mother, and grandmother to my great-grandmother, the late Senator Charles Percy.  Helen rose first in the Senate, her son, Robert, followed in the House, and served as an aide to the then-Senator Harry Truman, and then, after he left the Senate, to President Clinton, before becoming Vice President for the remainder of his life.  The late Kay Hagan, a devoted publicist and beloved wife of the late Senator John C. Byrd, is well known as one of our Nation's foremost and most faithful servants.  Born in the town of Bangor, Tennessee, in 1873, she married and had three children: Helen Harwell, Sam, and Robert C. of Washington, Sr.; Marka, Jr.; and Joseph, Sr.; but after the birth of her two children, her four children were all born during
