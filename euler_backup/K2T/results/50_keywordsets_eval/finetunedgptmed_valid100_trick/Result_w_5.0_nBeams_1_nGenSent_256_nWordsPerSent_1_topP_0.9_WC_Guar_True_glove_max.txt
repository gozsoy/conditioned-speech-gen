The concern that I have with the first half of this is the last half that I have with it before that it seems to be an overreach into the area of endangered species and then put this on the back burner just before it was put on the back burner after half minutes. It seems very out of character with what this is and seems very much a push by the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee to take a step back from the high-level environmental policies that we have put in place over the past 4 or 5 years so that we can focus on the important issues that this administration and this new administration want to see us focus

It is essential that the board report to the Congress with a clear and forward-looking vision on labor management and that it give the American public an opportunity to review its work and its accomplishments during the past decade.  The National Labor Relations Board has been the Federal Government's leader in labor negotiations for the last 30 years and its recommendations have been a key committee holding in the Commission's work.  When the Federal Government appoints the National Labor Relations Board, it takes a long-term view on the National Labor Relations Act and the challenges that this authority will bring to both the Federal Government and the American public. The board lands in this powerful committee to continue its work on behalf of all Federal employees and reflects the best values of the Federal Government.  Every member of the National Labor Relations Board is a Federal employee, and they hold their leadership posts. Their dedicated, honest work is done with the same effort and integrity that Members of Congress strive for, and their experience and expertise will be instrumental in guiding the Board in its work.  I want to recognize the work of the National Labor Relations Board during its time

I will admit that I don't always agree with the leadership on many issues. However, this debate has resulted in substantial advances in health care reform. Most importantly, it has led to more affordable health care options for working people. My home State of Washington has improved the health care outcomes of a large number of our residents. I believe that the public and private health insurance markets have had substantial improvements in affordability and quality. With rising costs and rising health care costs, the affordability is even greater in many communities in Washington. As a result, more seniors are seeking coverage as their incomes increase. Americans have made the choices to find new care opportunities instead of relying on the care they already have.  All of this has been accomplished through careful consideration and vigorous debate within this Chamber, and I believe that, by

. Mr. President, as the bill before us requires under the Budget Control Act and its subsequent provision to reduce the budget deficit by 5 percent over 10 years, the United States has often faced the question of the long-term debt that must be paid in the future. Here at home the question of the long-term debt has a dual nature of its own. Most Americans know that the Federal Government has a responsibility to pay its debts because they have been spending money on foreign wars and war spending that has come in our way and that has caused us great economic and social problems overseas as well as long in the future when the Soviet Union lost its economic dominance. The question of the long-term debt has even become more pressing because during the Obama administration we have seen for the first time a serious flight of the ship carrying the crew of a major fleet that would be forced to do emergency maintenance and to sail it out of the way so that no war could ever come upon us that would hold our Nation as Putin, Kim Jong Un and their allies would like it to hold us.  If the nuclear deal is good for America's national security, then why should we care that if we don't pay our debt we will go into an economic depression that will pose a real threat to our national security?

. Mr. Speaker, this Congress has been in the spotlight for the first time in many months about the House Republicans' decision to end the law, Speaker Boehner's way, that has been passed with such tremendous bipartisan support that some even called it a reset button in terms of what might happen in the future and how our country would move forward. They have decided to take their hand off the credit card and take the easy way out and stop the growth of our economy and balance the budget so that there would be no more fiscal responsibility for us in the future.  Well, to my friends on the other side of the aisle and even the rest of the world around the world, that is no way to reserve your future.  So the American people want us to get back to doing what we have been doing the last year and one and a half. They want us to keep the lights on, to reduce our deficit, but at the same time have every possible means of working together to create the most competitive environment for small businesses and entrepreneurs in the world.  The very basic story of what happened in December and January, if you could not tell, is we brought tax reform to the House in a way that took away most of the biggest loopholes that were designed to benefit the very wealthiest Americans.

My core promise to the American people was that I would never pass on a resolution that would cost more than $1 million to be considered on the floor to our dear friends to the north in fiscal year 2010, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Sessions).  As the result of the March 2 legislative session and this obligation to the Rules Committee which yields to the Chief Clerk, I passed on some rule bills, but they were as difficult to obtain as a 707 bill before the House in 1997.  Most of these bills now move through the bill committee quickly and without that support of the House or the majority. At times, these types of bills got in the way of passing important bills for the good of the people of the United States.  So on March 22, Mr. Speaker, today the Rules Committee passed on 11 different bills that supported important and necessary programs, but cost more than $1 million to do so.

This bill is just one example of what must be done to help business up and get back on their feet after the terrible effects of the Hurricane of 2013. It would also add up to good American jobs and good investment in our Nation.

President Obama said this bill is not going to hurt the economy. Secretary of State Clinton said it is not going to hurt the U.S. economy. Most importantly, we all agreed that we must strengthen the economy and create jobs and make it even easier for businesses to create jobs and make programs to make things easier for people to do more with their time and put less of it in the pocket of the poor and needy. Now, some of us believe this is not the way we should be doing it.  I support this bill. I also support the fact that we should be passing it through the Committee on Foreign Relations, as we should, before the President leaves office to pursue the priorities that he indicated when he gave the commencement speech at Princeton University last week.  As I indicated last week, we are going to continue to be discussing the issue of foreign aid and of aid to vulnerable countries in an open and transparent manner.

The American people are the reason we are here in the Senate and the reason the Senate operates the way Oregon does. They understand the importance of Congress to the people of this country.

Well-intentioned lawmakers like Speaker Paul Ryan have crafted legislation that we were able to pass through the Defense Appropriations Committee a few weeks ago that would allow anyone who finds themselves as a veteran with a form of the familiar kinds of illnesses that many veterans suffering from these serious heart conditions confront to have an opportunity to file for disability compensation claims.  It is interesting that Congress ultimately did not authorize this so-called condolence payments. I want to say a few words about that, but before we do, let me give a few things a minute.

First and foremost, our financial system is no longer at the intersection of strict central planning and private enterprise. It's at the intersection of capital markets and foreign investment.  When the crisis hit, our financial institutions, such as Lehman Brothers, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, abided by regulations that played a major role in creating and sustaining the financial crisis and keeping us from a decline. Yet, those regulations can be

<|endoftext|> If I can ask a question, the last time the Senate had to act on the fiscal year 2010 budget was December 19, 2011. We had to vote on it to raise the debt ceiling because it was the last chance to try to balance the budget. So this time it should not be that difficult to raise the debt ceiling when there is a surplus in the bank of the United States of America, I mean in the interest rate reserve fund.  It was before this year's crisis. That caused the Republican majority to push it a year early to try to balance the budget when they were trying to drive America into financial collapse. And you know what? Now the Senate will be faced with another deficit problem, another attempt to extract a ransom from the American people. The Americans, they are becoming a very different people. We don't know who will be asking for our retirement savings. It could be we are going to be inundated with angry calls asking us to pay the bills we have already collected. Or maybe it will be an American equivalent of a piggy bank.  In fact, I think this year's budget falls somewhere in the middle of the two. It is the exact opposite of what the American people want from the Federal Government.  And to think that the

This is something we need to get on this side of the aisle for both the Appropriations and Economy Committee that are in effect now but maybe not quite here at this time. I am glad that it is a product of the fact that we have one of our colleagues, very helpful to me very good in this regard, talking about it in terms of what needs to happen and that he is optimistic about the future. I thank him for his kind words about this.  I want to take a second to give our national energy renaissance a second look since last year when there is a lot more focus than we normally would typically produce and we are going to have some real consequences in terms of what is happening in terms of price competitiveness to this country because this nation is making terrible decisions and disastrous choices and we can't afford to follow the money.  This national energy renaissance is a short-term thing, particularly now that we have seen the oil price rise more than 400 percent since the summer of 2014, but what is happening in the Middle East, looking at the Middle

<|endoftext|> First of all, I would say to my friend who just said that it was President Bush who did the tax cuts. I think he knows that all of us believe in having tax cuts, and we all believe that is the way to get it done in the future. As we saw with the Bush tax cuts in the 1990s and the 2000s that actually were not very popular propped up with tax cuts, some of our colleagues started to object to that at a time when they were in the majority in this body so they could get the legislation done. In this particular case we have bipartisan bills that are going to be there for the future that are going to bring more revenue to this country so we can pay for the programs that we have. But I would object to anybody calling it the GOP's way out. The other side wants to make changes to the American tax system. They want to move the tax burden offshore so there is less incentive for us to be paying that tax on ourselves. In the current atmosphere that exists in Washington, I don't think the American people want to see that happen.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

young community sexual campus congressional 

Final sequence: 

. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against the House Republicans' flawed legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. This bill is the product of an effort to score political points and is the last measure to go before Congress before the Republican leadership is forced to admit failure and vote for the Republican budget that they were promised would be more popular than the congressional budget they are now trying to ram through the Senate.  This bill is both irresponsible and worse than irresponsible because it gives the American people very little in return for their hard work and support. As we know well enough by now, the program is working well and young people and small businesses are finding it very challenging to keep up with growing health care costs that will force many of our community health centers to shut their doors before the new health care law is fully implemented in 2014 or beyond.  My home State of North Carolina has a particularly difficult time dealing with the campus of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as it struggles with rising health care costs and student borrowing and student debt. This is due to sexual assault, the result of campus sexual assault, and the root cause of the increasingly predatory marketing practices around campus that treat and go after rape victims and young people who might try to report or be made aware of sexual assault on college campuses.

Final sequence: 

. Mr. Speaker, the public health care act is an important part of the Affordable Care Act and we must pass it in order to protect those Americans who already have health care coverage because States have to accept Medicaid expansion under the health care law. States cannot refuse to expand Medicaid eligibility for patients of this age simply because the Medicaid eligibility limits are too high. Medicaid Medicaid has no age limit because Medicare is a Federal program. When a person is eligible for Medicare when they turn 18, they become eligible for any Medicare services provided under the law to that person even if the other requirements of the law force States to put the limit in place. The law does not say that States cannot do what they can with the best of intentions but this is a very important issue that must be addressed because when a person is later told they can no longer obtain the Medicare service they sought because Speaker Pelosi said so and the legislation does not explicitly say that, they cannot do what they want, even though they have no prior eligibility for Medicare.  The fact is there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who are waiting to get health care because they have been told they can't get health care because it is too expensive. It is the person at the end of the line who is paying the highest price--the premiums that are also

Madam Speaker, last year I voted to not authorize an audit of the Federal Workforce Commission by the Financial Services Committee because the Commission pursued so much from the private sector rather than from the public sector that in some areas they were already overreaching in their financial planning and accounting and research activities and that this would only add to their already high risk and our long-term problems here in this Congress and the Nation and in our country. The Government Accountability Office must review these activities before they are taught in school students so students understand and be able to use them when they are doing work that they can do themselves as independent professionals in their own field and as citizens in their own community without taking an American job from work at that time of work teaching these programs to their fellow citizens to fill these jobs because now we have the need to have programs to fill these jobs and put more people to work that are at home at their studios in their homes or on the Web.  At a time when we have to continue to rebuild America's infrastructure and invest in education, to actually make sure that we have the jobs that we want for our workers in this country, these programs must be audited.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of today's Special Order.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection.  Improved Water Supply to All Areas of our Nation is an important and very good way to ensure water security for every area of our Nation. And as is our tradition here on the floor of the House, we take our oath of office protecting the water supply and the environmental and natural resource within the State of California by supporting the Governor's Water Pipeline Initiative to build and maintain infrastructure to supply cities and towns in California with water supply needed for their water supply supply infrastructure needs.  As with all water pipelines projects in California and across the Nation, the pipeline project in refinery in San Joaquin Valley would involve the interchange of local water and pipeline water systems. Pipelines in this case would allow water flow between the refinery and a distribution system serving an export market in South America.

Bill was no stranger to American politics, one who spent years working on behalf of community and community projects while he was in public service.

The Constitution is clear: We are all on an equal playing field, and we should stand together. My bill brings private insurance that covers workers and families to parity with the ``involuntary'' system.  Americans should be willing to work hard for a better life. American's deserve that choice.  This bill will cost Americans around $500 billion over 10 years, which the Senate is willing to accept, but it will not cost the taxpayers more than it cost the administration--about $800 billion.

Final sequence: 

. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you a tragic story in West Virginia that is becoming all too common to our country and the world today. The United States is seeing the number of Iranian citizens get larger as Iran continues to gain in influence on the world stage.  Unfortunately, our leaders should know this new regime is not just plotting to impose its oppressive regime on Americans and its people. Indeed, some in the administration have openly advocated for increased Iranian influence and even threatened a military response if Iran ever establishes a nuclear weapon.  As Iran continues to gain more influence on all of our regions, they need to learn to consume less and live more like the United States.  Yesterday, we saw a new tactic in which the administration moved to cut the funding for the Office of National Drug Control Policy by $600 million to the Federal Drug Administration. The intent of this cutback was to fund a number of drug reforms proposed by the Obama administration. My favorite case of the administration trying to walk the brambles has to be the $400 million that the administration cut to the Drug Enforcement Administration, the unit dedicated to cracking down on drug abuse.  I was disappointed to learn yesterday that the administration cut a $65 million reimbursement for methadone, another Federal program that has been under

The President did not respond with the urgency that he should have when the appropriations bills he passed months ago were so painfully short of funds. Congress has a responsibility to act and that responsibility is to decide the committees of jurisdiction that should be authorized and funding priorities that should be focused on and who should be appropriated funds.

Final sequence: 

. Mr. President, today I recognize another longtime public servant in this Senate, former Assistant Attorney General Stephen Heilman from West Virginia. He was the legal counsel to then President Bill Clinton from 1994 to 1996 and then to President George H.W. Bush from 2001 to 2003. He was now the legal counsel to the current President from 2009 to 2011 and to his daughter and to their respective husbands and their respective spouses. He has been a well-respected and trusted public servant in the House of Representatives and in the Senate for many years now and will be missed to all but those who have lost a close friend to this time back home in West Virginia.  Prior to joining the law firm of Rose Law Firm in 2001 as Assistant Attorney General, Heilman served as an assistant to unanimous consent from 1993 to 1996 as a special assistant to the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia in Energy and Natural Resources in exchange for higher yield on litigation fees, emergency aid, and representation to state and local law enforcement officials. During that time, he was one of the first West Virginians to be hired by former U.S. Attorney Floyd Olson.  As the sole resident of Stevensville, WV, Heilman has worked tirelessly to advance West Virginia's interests.

. Madam President, Senator Clinton could not have been more right about the importance of the need to have a functioning Social Security system in order to support families who have been living in poverty for decades or more in the face of decades of economic turmoil and working conditions that have not been in place for them for decades or more. President Obama acknowledged that in his State of the Union Address last year when he said that Social Security will pay for itself with programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and that we should work to help people have access to the resources they need in order to work and to help help work to help their families work and help the efforts to lower the retirement age to 67 so that we have an established Social Security system to help the people who need it today with the people who need it for the many years and decades in the future when that system is going to need the street credibility of the long-term fiscal situation.  Madam President, the idea of having a Social Security system that cannot work is not only wrong, it is not something that should be talked about at all. It is something that is not going to happen in this country if we do not invest in it.  When it comes to seniors' health care, it is a serious issue. The Clinton administration used to talk

articles opposition record speaker impeachment 

Final sequence: 

. Madam Speaker, in an effort to support the Iraq War, Republican Senators have ignored an extraordinary request for $1 billion in additional funding for critical anti-corruption reforms in Iraq by the Senate Democratic leadership in an attempt to undermine the impeachment effort against President Obama and to hold members of the Obama administration to account for their foreign policy record.  In February 2011, Senators Reid and Kennedy wrote a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi asking for an additional $1 billion for anti-corruption reforms and report the results of their study to Congress within a month. Democratic Leader Obama has refused to meet these leadership opposition requests and has rather delayed responding to these letters in order to promote the President's agenda of war and a weakening of our government and international institutions. Articles in the New York Times and Politico show the Republican leadership's desire to prop up and expand President Obama's foreign policy and, by extension, the elections process.  The effectiveness of that resolution is now in question. President Obama and his Democratic backers have laid out a plan to offer a closed-door and secret vote on the Senate floor that would create a loophole for self-reported election fraud. There is only one thing that could deny that congressional hearings, adjudication, and the writing of a new Constitution could interfere with that process.

If you can, do it.  The people of our country know that we have to fix this problem. We have to give patients, they know that we have to give them the choice of going to another State, a different State--the important thing is that they have the choice.  You talk about people that don't have choice, but if you lose some of the choices we have to make this health care bill that we pass today, you lose all of that.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and insert extraneous materials into the Record on the topic of the legislation they are about to vote on.

history million obama congress spent 

Final sequence: 

<|endoftext|> Thank you so much for the kind words and for those who voted for me here to the Senate to be the President of the United States of America. I want to take this opportunity to talk about how Congress can actually get more people back to work when Congress has spent millions of dollars on a failed stimulus program and has left behind these long-term unemployment and benefits to the public sector and how this administration can actually get people back to work in the private sector and how the Obama administration has been extremely very much in our interest in helping those long-term unemployed people who were part of the stimulus program in the last year of the recession to go back to work in the private sector to even bring the Federal unemployment rate down to 10 percent as the history class I taught recently has explained how our great public sector has been heavily responsible in bringing that down to 8 to 9 percent.  But there is one area that we can do a lot more to get our economy moving again in order to actually help the long-term unemployed people who are part of the stimulus program. And that is to create jobs. One of the first things we have to do is create good-paying jobs. There are a lot of examples out there. If you want to look in the labor statistics and look at

provisions children victims end section 

Final sequence: 

. Mr. Speaker, this is an amendment to the appropriations bill that is going to continue funding the programs at the end of the fiscal year for the Children and Families section of the Department of Health and Human Services. This amendment is a specific amendment that would cut funding for victims and survivors of domestic violence who are running up Federal debts or other liability because of the stigma of it and because of the loss of the ability to pay bills in court. It would eliminate funding for provisions that do things that encourage more women in their cases to come forward.  I wanted to first express my outrage over the majority's decision to turn our attention to these so-called front end needs. This does nothing more than create additional obstacles in the way of future justice for victims and survivors of domestic violence.  Domestic violence has contributed to the suicide rate for first responders, the loss of life from accidents, and the increase in the suicide rate in family families experiencing loss, especially those who are employed. So, again, it makes no sense. This is just another example of how the majority is simply out of touch with reality.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

But even though there is some Republican opposition to the health care legislation, the only other Member of Congress who has a bill on the floor that is Republican-sponsored is the House minority leader, Representative Boehner. So you have a deficit-obsessed Republican Congress with health care coming to the House floor, and nobody is criticizing the bill that is coming to the House floor.
