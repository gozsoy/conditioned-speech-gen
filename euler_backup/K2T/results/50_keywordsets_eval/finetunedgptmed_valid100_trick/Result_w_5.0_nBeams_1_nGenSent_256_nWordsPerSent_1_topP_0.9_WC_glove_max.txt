I was proud to stand before the history and the dignity of this Nation and what we can and can not do with the United States, what we can do to help other people in the world and what we can not do to lead by example and to lead this Nation and lead the world in a more positive and just direction than we have seen the world take us for the last 10 years as a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  With that, I will urge my colleagues to stand up to the hypocrisy of the Congressional Republican leadership and to the fact that the President cannot be sure that we won't see a significant rise in spending and more of the same because the

And the Members of the Committee have a responsibility to pay proper consideration for the expenditure of their time and their resources. And I think the fact is that the purpose of the financial assistance plan at the request of the Governor of the State or region to provide financial assistance to State and local governments in ``support of their public services and management of its public lands and resources'' that also has provisions to the Federal Reserve does have to be considered in the Committee.  The Committee has also been under a Budget Resolution for the past 10 days for consideration of the national security spending and the budget for this Congress and consideration of continuing government programs. And under a Budget Resolution, the appropriate committees were included, so it is our sense that we should have additional time to work through and to develop our recommendations to the full Committee.  <|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|>

We have looked at this legislation through the lens of what it would cost and what it would actually take to produce what the committee has asked for. We have seen it in the study by the Congressional Research Service that this bill would cost $45 billion. We have looked at the bill before us with an amendment to require Members to offset those savings with increased costs, but that is not where we are at today. We see it from his views and his position as a new chairman of the committee with several amendments pending, and so that leads us to believe that these savings he has looked at are not possible or may never be realized in terms of what the savings from a cost of $45 billion is going to yield to the American people.  I have to say there was not a lot of discussion about the costs of this bill before the hearing that went on here tonight with the Republicans, so it is hard to know what the

The President is not the only one who believes that there should be a bipartisan group in Congress that will put this country back on the right path of economic recovery and national security, but I do not think Speaker Boehner would say that in the Congress of the United States. If he says that this Congress has agreed with the President on this, it should be passed to the President's desk and signed by the President, not our committee of jurisdiction.  Mr. Speaker, our Committee of jurisdiction is made up of only Republican Members and Republican staff. If a Republican member of the committee says it is the right thing to do for the American people and the American economy to get this done now and get it done on time and on budget authority in the House, that is his right to do so. So we should always put the interest of the American people and of our Nation first in the House Judiciary Committee and the House Finance Committee when it comes to these big job-creating and investment-making bills that should be passed to the President for his signature. It is his bill and it is his responsibility as President to get it passed, not our committee of jurisdiction.  On the Department of Justice side of the aisle, there is the question

. Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in support of S. 1963, the Homeland Security Incentives for States Act of 2009. It provides incentives to States to improve their emergency preparedness.  In fact, there are almost 600 National Organizations for State and Local Government, such as the Washington State Department of Emergency Services and a number of other Federal agencies. However, there are more than 500 State and local governments that are not subject to these incentives.  This legislation is about providing incentives to State and local government employees and improving the ability to protect citizens from terrorism. The bill also provides incentives to States and local government contractors to work together and help solve our country's energy challenges while ensuring that we have adequate funding to keep our energy supply secure and affordable. This legislation is key to getting our Nation more prepared for a future attack on our Nation. I ask my colleagues to support this bill and vote ``yes'' on passage.  I yield back the balance of my time.  Rogue interest groups and special interests are working in a more expensive and less efficient way to reduce jobs, cripple our economy, and reduce wages. We need commonsense legislation that will address those concerns. The sale of Federal lands or transfer of taxpayer funds may be the most effective way to stimulate economic development,

. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to continue my critical work on this bill to rebuild our American infrastructure by improving the road and rail system and building more long-term future infrastructure projects in this country.  Many of our communities have spent decades underfunding the construction of critical public transit projects like the New York Transit Authority system and the highways and bridges that support it.  In my State of New York, the General Services Administration has estimated the nearly $4 billion transportation project backlog on the York system alone could consume nearly $2 billion per year by 2040. Those are dollars that could go to buy the books to buy more transit lines.  I am pleased that this bill will use the resources that are being allocated for the projects within the bill, as well as in the budget for the Department of Transportation to eliminate or lessen unnecessary obstacles that hinder our ability to spend the money we have on transportation projects and put them to use for the benefit of our communities.  Our research has found that even an average of one large transit project could be saved in the largest towns by building more in smaller communities, if only one large project were built, but this is not going to happen. It is a two-pronged approach and I believe it is one that the American people can support and also

We want to give them that chance this time to lead as they have when they get back to the work that is required in Congress.  Today is also the 2-year anniversary of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, now in its second year of operation. This was the key element of the legislation that Republicans on the House and Senate have been pushing for for the last 4 years. I applaud

I commend Congressman Berman for his leadership in this area and for his support of funding for State and Tribal entities for this purpose.  As Mr. Berman noted, the Nation is moving in the direction of being a more connected society and a stronger Nation. Since the 1965 Nation Building Act was passed, the United States has invested over $3 trillion in building a more connected Nation.

Nineteen million Americans lack health insurance and nearly one in four are uninsured. A lack of access to affordable healthcare could be a significant public health crisis in our country. Policymakers in Washington should prioritize their efforts to create and support low-cost and universal healthcare coverage by making health insurance universal rather than concentrated and expensive across large segments of the country. I am glad that Congress is moving forward on legislation that ensures that every American has access to quality, affordable, quality health care. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and support the passage of the bill today.  Mr. PERMUTTER. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, we are here because of a tragedy that occurred on the East Coast of the United States on Tuesday when a plane carrying 3 American troops was shot down by terrorists near the border of the United States and China.  President Obama has spoken about this matter as though it were not going on the very border that the President and Secretary of Defense Gates both discussed in their press conferences. He had promised that the Department of Defense would be ready to take on the terrorist threat in this country, and that is exactly what it has been doing. Secretary Gates has stressed repeatedly that the administration is prepared to have the security needs of our men and women in uniform responded to on the ground, and we thank him for that. It was Secretary Gates that stated that the Department of Defense would continue to address this crisis by the President and the Secretary of State with the ability to respond to that emergency in the most effective way possible. The reason we have passed this bill today with two Members of Congress is because the administration has taken the lead on this issue and has come to the bipartisan agreement that we need to have the security needs of our men and women in uniform taken care of on the border. There are other issues we need to be working on right now and it is not the only one. I hope

The ERSON Act of 2001 was introduced by my friend Senator Lugar in February of this year and has received very strong bipartisan support from Members of both parties. It is in the spirit of common sense that the legislation before us today would have expanded market access for small businesses across the Nation and would do so at the level of individual States rather than at the level of the Federal Government. The ERSON Act would also provide certainty to companies operating in the small businesses or a new industry by allowing them to leverage their special expertise and the resources of other private sector firms to improve the design and performance of a product to further the success of the manufacturer and/or the manufacturer's operations in the broader market.  The Senate should act to move forward on this important legislation before it is too late. In the past two legislative sessions and under the previous administration, the ERSON Act has been made the focal point of much of the small business debate and has received strong bipartisan support from both sides of the aisle.

That is why we are here with this amendment to this resolution for the Senate to pass the fiscal year 2010 appropriations bill that is being considered this week and send it to the President for his signature before we close up the Congress at midnight today in the next couple of hours. As we all know, the administration says the Committee on Ways and Means has been on the bill for far too long with no hope of ever actually passing it by this time this week. If we can get $5 billion of this year's spending cuts to come from the people on our side of the aisle, that will be a good start. But we still have not seen the most critical legislation that will help make that happen. What this legislation will do is force the full Senate to come to its feet and do what we have always done--we start the government and go do it this week for the good of the country.

Since the last time the Senate considered a final version of this legislation in August 2008, the House passed it in an overwhelming bipartisan vote and passed it by a clear and overwhelming vote.  During those intervening months of debate, we have heard very few constructive criticisms of the legislation and have taken what we consider the critical steps necessary to ensure the underlying legislation is dealt with properly as we pass this legislation. However, I have some additional concerns about this legislation in light of reports that raise questions about the Federal workforce and whether they are being adequately supported by the Department of Labor.

The Accessory Whistleblower Protection Act was signed into law by President Obama in May of this year. The legislation includes an initial statutory review of Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General investigations into the misuse of government procurement contracts and the activities of the Executive Office of the President. Under current law, the Inspector General must report on the inspector general's finding within 60 days. As noted earlier by the President in May, this is a critical time to report on the IG's findings and a time when public trust in government agencies is at an all-time low.  Due to the increased level of corruption and other troubling behavior that has plagued government agencies and Federal agencies on the Department of Commerce to date, the Office of Inspector General must have the ability to identify and determine whether the procurement agencies that hold these contracts have conducted a full and fair review of the use of government procurement dollars and potential uses of taxpayer dollars to conceal misconduct from the public. In turn, this is the information that would allow the Department to take appropriate action to restore public confidence and to prevent future misuse of taxpayer dollars and help our Federal

. Mr. Speaker, yesterday morning I was surprised to be joined by a fellow Colorado member of the Colorado State Legislature, Representative John Garamendi. He said he voted against the program in the past, and he also voted against the debt limit in the past, but it was only a year ago that the debt ceiling was raised again. It was then that the Republicans first raised the debt ceiling in 2006 and passed it again in 2007 and 2008, before President Obama came and put the entire Federal Government into default with the 2008 Federal Government debt limit increase. That is when the people of Colorado voted to put the economy on a better course. This is our opportunity to put the economy on a better course now and to give the people the confidence that we are going to do our job and pass real spending bills. That is what we are going to do for the American people now and for the Senate to pass this bill when we have that opportunity.  It is a frustrating time in our country today to go through what we saw yesterday when the President released his budget and the Speaker of the House and the Senate first raised the debt ceiling and then the President put the entire Federal Government into default with the debt limit increase.  This bill has a lot of good things in it. It increases the interest rate

Mr. Speaker, what a great honor and pleasure to be recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal Act bill, and I am proud to stand with Chairman Hastings on this legislation to honor the United States Senate for its service to our Nation and to recognize the best in the Senate at their time of greatest need.  The post-World War II heroic men and women of the Senate all worked to continue the country's crucial role in international affairs and civil society. Like the United States Congress, Senators today are strong, dedicated and committed to preserving America's traditions of public service. In the Senate we are proud to remember some of the distinguished colleagues who have passed away in recent years while others have served on the Senate floor in their stead. Mr. Hastings's bill is one of those such an important recognition of the Senate's most distinguished figures. It is in keeping with that tradition that this gentleman is authoring the bill today in the House of Representatives.  The Gold Medal Act recognizes the work of the Senate that has contributed to world peace and security by dedicating special accolades to the names of all Members of the Senate who have passed the highest possible standards for their service to their country. Senator Hastings is the first Senator to receive this recognition from the American people. The first Senators to receive this honor

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would designate September 20 as National Rental Reentry Day and Congressmen DeSaulnier and Heller will introduce a bill to designate November 1 as Veterans Day. Congress has recognized the men and women who have served our country by providing programs to help those who have not been re-engaged in the workforce and can best be described as retirement security ``heirlooms.'' These programs help those who have served in the military by providing them with an opportunity to enjoy and celebrate their retirement years in a safe environment where they can feel connected to their loved ones and find a fulfilling and fulfilling retirement at a time when the American Dream is more and more in danger. The American Dream and the American Dream Party promise a future in which each and every American has the ability to succeed and be a productive citizen in the years to come and that is why many of the so-called Americans who are working now are in our military. As we know with regard to the President and the Defense Department budget now there are many cuts in that budget. As the Secretary of Defense, I would like to provide an opportunity for us to all to talk about what these cuts could mean for our military and their families who would be negatively impacted by them.

Mr. Speaker, I think we all recognize that this Congress has spent considerable resources managing the Federal debt and have been very clearly clear that we are not going to accept the notion that we are going to spend more to manage our economy because that is what we elected to do. We have set aside some of our constitutional responsibility and had some very clear requests that we have submitted to ensure that we not be spending a huge amount of our constitutional constitutional authority in a way that limits our ability to grow the economy. But to try to say that we are going to fund our Nation through spending without even an appropriation amendment is wrongheaded and something we will not accept in this Congress.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

. Mr. Chair, as chair of the North Carolina Black Caucus, I am committed to ensuring that all North Carolinians can work to reduce the health disparities in their communities. This bill includes some very important reforms that are long overdue. The Black caucus should be commended for working with a distinguished group of representatives from the State, such as Representative Keith Ellison, Chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee.  In addition to getting the most out of our research and development, this legislation provides for investments that will improve outcomes for Black people, especially low-income people. These investments will create employment opportunities for people of all ages in our communities and will improve access to health care services. As I stated earlier, with the transition to a new health care system, health disparities can affect a person's health and well-being in many ways that are not well understood. It is important to build on the progress made in reducing racial disparities in health outcomes in North Carolina to develop solutions that actually work for our community and our country.  For example, since 1970, public education in our State has been increasingly targeted for those most in need.

I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with and for the Exposition and the participation of the President and Vice President of Public Affairs and Public Affairs for the past 7 years. The Connecticut High School Exposition is a free-flowing event that attracts more than 4,000 people every year. The Exposition provides opportunities for State leaders and citizens to debate issues ranging from transportation to child nutrition to transportation bill and energy policy and much more. All participants at the event can hear from local business owners, families, educators and businesses, and youth groups about the Exposition and how to participate in the upcoming weeklong event that will take place on Saturday, March 16, 2019, in the town of Littleton. I appreciate all the work the Exposition is doing in keeping our communities and our State relevant and ready for tomorrow's election. I wish to extend my sincere thanks to my colleagues and the Exposition administration staff who work to make the Connecticut High School Exposition a success every year.

What the Congress is trying to do is to make sure that the public and the government is kept fully informed about what has been done so that they have a decision in regard to how they will express their opinion and how they will vote in this matter. This is not a simple decision that is going to be made by bureaucrats here in Washington. They can certainly make that decision in their own political interest and in their own judgment and there is a process there as well where those rights are fairly administered as well and those organizations have the opportunity to express their opinion and to provide information to the public so that the public will decide for themselves. But, no, this Congress should be in this business to ensure that the American people can decide for themselves about how they will choose to vote so that, in fact, they have an opportunity to express their views. This has been a bipartisan issue here in Congress that this administration has opposed.  The major objective here is to get the legislative process over. It is done by legislative and rulemaking on the Judiciary Committee and by rollcall votes on the floor of the House of Representatives on the Presidential nominee, this President, to decide how they would vote on this nomination.

After the signing of the treaty, the Senate held a vote to suspend the effect of the nonmilitary obligations arising from the adoption of the treaty and the adoption of the treaty of the same name. The vote was 10 to 8 in favor of the action that was to have been taken with regard to the arms sales. The suspension was maintained by the Members. However, a decision has been made by a special Senate committee that does not meet the standards of regular order for making that determination under the Senate rules and regulations. The vote was 10 to 6 in favor of the suspension. The suspension is only for a time period of 1 year and the charter rights are to run out after that time period. In accordance with the rules of the Senate and in the approval of the committee, the suspension is affirmed and the treaty of the same name is passed to that side.

He has a great responsibility to explain what he has heard from State school officials who have been expressing concerns to the administration that their funding is not being made up because our funding programs are being cut because of this legislation.  I will say that I believe there is a very good bill that is being considered in the Senate but that is not being supported by the House bill because that bill would require us to apply funding for spending programs that we have already passed in the House. That is why the Senators from Oregon and Massachusetts have introduced amendment No. 3499 to repeal the bill. That means they would be taking this bill out and making it permanent and disapprove the bill altogether.  So I would like to compliment the Senator from Oregon on his remarks and remind him, as the Senator from Massachusetts has said, we are now working on the manager's amendment to the House bill that would add a much stronger requirement for the President to report to the Congress his budget priorities that are coming out of his Department of Education, and in the next few days we will have a chance to discuss it.

This is something that is the heart and soul of our economy and whether we like it or not, it is going to affect the everyday lives of every American and the lives of our people for the next generation and generations to come. That is why the Republican leadership has chosen the Speaker's position today to emphasize these issues with the American people and this must be a time of great strength to make sure that small businesses have the resources to continue to grow and do so by putting the people back to work and creating the middle class again in America. That is why this is the special issue that I think it is so important to set the Record straight on this issue of the financial security of families in this country, the financial security of small businesses in this country and the American workers that are struggling for every day of their lives to have the opportunity to work and provide a better future for themselves and their children so that they can have that American Dream.

One of the ways to get judges to make the law of this country is to have their names on the Constitution of this country that gives them the authority to decide whether to recognize a judge from the area in which they are serving. This means that their name must be on that court not only so that we can always count on them to have good faith and fair treatment of the various issues that may come before them but also so that we can then judge the judges and know that they will not take their political life over and over again because they will be serving us in a way that will help ensure that we can always count on them to be fair and just.

This bill is the result of an original bipartisan bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee by voice vote with unanimous support over the past several months. The bill the committee is considering now today makes substantial changes to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2008 to reflect the realities of the modern global environment and offers the same level of robust financial support to the nation as the bill that passed the House of Representatives earlier this year but was not put before the Senate for its consideration because of the continuing budget impasse. The bill also makes major reforms to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 to give States the opportunity to get input on the legislation before Congress. While the Senate version of this bill contains several important but relatively small reforms, the House bill contains many more important but little-used reforms that would not be in the Senate bill without the cooperation and support of the House of Representatives that it will soon produce for this bill.

Mr. President, the President took a photo of an African American church in Oklahoma City on his way to the State of the Union speech, and while the President and First Lady have said that the photo was meant to be a ``positive reflection on the first lady and the first lady staff,'' it also will make us angry at the Republican leaders in the House and Senate for taking the President up on his request to move that church out of the national monument and give it to a church that would not even be aware of the history and the impact that it would have on the community it was intended for. The First Presidency and the First Ladies made clear that there are as many on the West Coast as on the East Coast that are deeply concerned about the impact that the President may have on the local community. They say that they would like to understand the impact of the President's actions before they act to protect the area or the national monument, and they are not going to have that kind of time now. They should recognize that the church in this photo has religious and cultural ties to so many of the communities around the Nation that have the same history and even the same cultural association with the First Presidency and the First Ladies as the Presiding Officer did in his visit to the First Lady's church.

. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the amazing team of students who are now teaching our young people in college and university community college about sex education.  Sex education is a vital component of my Congressional district school curriculum. For example, sex education is offered at Georgia Tech High School in my district, where students study Sex Education 101 and Sexual Harassment Awareness Month. Students have also been able to learn about AIDS and other health issues through campus peer health centers.  Earlier this month, I heard about a sexual assault prevention lesson given to high school students at Texas Christian University's school of counseling, which found that even though these students didn't always know that their experiences of sexual assault were in violation of the law, their counselors were able to help them figure out the proper steps to follow. And I've been pleased to see that numerous other schools around the country are following suit and starting to start offering sex education classes to high school students and college students.  When I first heard of Texas Christian University's program, I sent out a request for comments about its approach to teaching sex education. They responded by revealing, via email, that the course they had recommended was actually a year old.  For those who didn't receive a response, I am incredibly pleased that it appears that

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the success of the United States Army Corps of Engineers Staff Sergeant Sean McCarthy for having been selected to serve as the first ever new Army Corps of Engineers public servant in the history of the Corps of Engineers.  The Army Corps of Engineers Public Service Commission was established in 1858 to provide Public Service with a civilian workforce to improve Federal programs and policies that are implemented to serve the public health, safety and welfare of the United States of America. It is the only force in the U.S. Government dedicated to the quality of care delivered by Federal employees to the public, including the Nation's health care system.  Mr. Speaker, when selected by the Senate and now selected for the competitive service by the Corps of Engineers, Sergeant McCarthy will begin an important new chapter in public service.  Sergeant McCarthy graduated from West Point in 2002 and received an honorary doctorate from Columbia University in 2006. In addition to his service in the United States Army, Sergeant McCarthy was elected to the Missouri General Assembly in 2011 for the first time. He serves in the Special District of the City of Columbia, with the rank of public servant. He is the only member of his family from an Army family to serve in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

If the majority wants to vote in December on legislation that will help continue to help our economy get back to full strength and give the American people back to work, they should be ready for work in December and do what we have agreed upon this morning in the Senate. Let's get moving on that bill to provide for the government to create jobs and increase the economy, because the American people deserve to have that prosperity now and on their terms.   galvanized by the June jobs report that was released by the Congressional Budget Office, American families continue to believe the recovery is sweeping them away and that the economy is failing.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1092, a bill which I have worked on for many years and as a good representative for the 20-something unemployment rate in my district in the House. This bill passed the House by voice vote last night and now has a good chance of passing the Senate, where it will protect good jobs and create good pay for workers across this country. This is a very important bill for everyone in this country.  The recent unemployment rate actually went down to 5.1 percent in May from 6.1 percent in August and a whole lot better than last year when the jobless rate hit 7 percent in August of last year. So that is just some good news for those of us in good shape to still find a job and not have to turn to the emergency room for help and pay a mortgage and gasoline for the car that we can't afford to take to the gas station because we are working so hard for the American people.

Senator Gregg has really offered such thoughtful amendments to make this a much more thoughtful debate. It is great to be joined by him and his friend, Senator Boxer, both of whom know a lot about this issue.   underwater, which is a part of the Housing and Urban Development bill we are debating, has been on the table, but perhaps in a more modest form than is Senator Feinstein's bill. We think this is an issue worth considering because of the importance of making sure we are not going to see that family stream leaving the State of Utah in the next few years or so and then coming to the country that has done so much to build this country. This family will have been in Utah so long that we have already seen some family members and ancestors of that family come to this country--for example, families coming over with their children and grandchildren or their great grandchildren who share that parent's proud tradition.

The most important thing is if they want a change in the Senate rules on those issues that they voted against the other day as a block of legislation and not approve of the next amendment to it so they can push it through the Senate and not hurt their economy or their families because they believe they can pass it with just 30 or 40 or 50 votes and that is what we should expect when we go to the House on April 18.

In the months since I was in those nations it has become clear to me how important this Congress has become in the people and how important America has been to the world for nearly two centuries now.  In Thailand alone we have visited the United States five times. Every time I went back to visit the leaders of the three nations that made the two Peace Treaty concessions to China, it was a significant measure of our support and understanding that the United States was a major actor in the region.  In Vietnam we were able to visit the leaders in the 19th Century to help bring democracy to that nation after that country had been ruled by the first Communist government in Vietnam's history.  In these nations and around the world, the United States has been one of the leaders on the front lines of human rights and democracy in the region for a long time. The United States leadership has been particularly important for the more than 60 million Vietnamese people and countless other people on the sidelines of this great conflict. So to me it is in America's best interest to give these countries and people in the region we visited something we can consider as well

. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Portman and I be recognized for up to 10 minutes to proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 44.  The  Wyman amendment No. 556 would strike the sponsor of S. 2391, a bill that      addresses national security and the need for energy independence, and would      take $1.7 million from the National Nuclear Security Administration. The bill was introduced in the Senate with President Obama's support, and the Senate gave its first consideration to the bill this morning.  Senator Portman and I have been engaged in working on this issue for quite some time. Senator Portman introduced this amendment in the summer of 2010, and we now have passed it the past several times. It is an important amendment for two reasons. First, it would force the government to create a more efficient structure for storing and distributing energy; and second, it would encourage innovation and innovation-driven energy policies.  The Department of Energy is already at least exploring the use of nuclear fuel for nonnuclear energy generation. Nuclear energy is already well-understood and is common practice in virtually every country in the world. If the Department were to put nuclear fuel on an industrial-scale industrial scale, it

If not present, the      presiding officer shall be the Senate Chair and the presiding      Senator of the Senate will control the proceedings.       The hearing will be limited to the bill and will be the      first of its kind in the history of the committee. In addition, the      committee will consider any amendments

. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5559, and to support the goals of the Medicare legislation that we just came up with. It will strengthen the Medicare trust fund and will provide about $4 billion of savings in the current year as a result of this measure. I think we should support that important measure which has all the support it needs.  When I came to Congress in 2010, I made sure that we took care of the people who need the most help as much as possible through reform of the Medicare program and increased spending on things like health care for seniors and for disabled workers, but particularly for the long-term care crisis that is facing so many people in our country. It is one of the reasons why we took up the goal of the Medicare Modernization Act so that we could make significant changes to this program while also ensuring that our seniors have the ability to keep going through the Medicare experience as they have with their own benefit. But for years we have talked about the need for the Medicare trust fund to work more like the Social Security trust fund so that it is a much more efficient and effective fund for Americans and the country that will serve as a model for future reform. When we talk about the current five-year bill,

. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the New Mexico University women's basketball team for winning the women's NCAA tournament for the first time in 28 years. The lead singer of the New Mexico University Chorale is also being honored today for her contributions to New Mexico music and its history and the history of the university in the State of New Mexico and the country as a whole. She also has had a great impact in her community, particularly in an area that was long neglected and underdeveloped in our State and that was a large part of her development as a young woman and later as a professional musician. So we are very proud to recognize her and congratulate her for her accomplishments and for her passion for music and her efforts in that community. I also want to thank the team of New Mexico University cheerleaders who put on one of the best intercollegiate college men's basketball teams in school history. The senior squad from New Mexico played the No. 2 seed New Mexico State University 84-65 and won the New Mexico State and the United States conference titles. They also won the Connecticut Valley Regional Championship and had a chance to play the top seed Rutgers University for the first time in history. The New Mexico State squad got off to a blazing start and did just that on the opening night

. Mr. Speaker, we are told that we can deal with health care for our nation's veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Well, do you know what? In the last session we spent more than $15 billion on health care for our veterans. That is $600 million that we spent on health care for our veterans last year and we will spend more money this year and there is nothing we can do to prevent or help the economic decline in our Nation's veterans.  Mr. Speaker, with the establishment of Medicaid in Tennessee, will our Nation's heroes get the health care they need and get access to health care for their children and our youth who care for them when we visit our veterans in hospitals and universities and community centers? That is what I am asking you to do when you visit us with my amendment. It will stop your insurance companies from cutting any available money from your health care benefits and it will force our Nation's leaders and our veterans to focus on what is really important, not just our health care, but our country and not to go to other countries in the Middle East and Asia to compete with the United States. Mr. Speaker, we should not be cutting health care for our veterans and we should not allow this to continue. If we do not take action to

. Madam Speaker, I thank the Speaker and the President for their generosity and the need to have the resources they have given us for this bill because we are so close to having a balanced budget resolution in the United States of America. We have such a strong economy in the United States of America. We have very strong middle class that is strong enough that we can handle the future needs of our country because we have no budget over the next year when we would need to be responsible for our debt and deficit and our deficit in the next year.  This is an incredibly important legislation that will impact so many people here in our country because it would have to change law in many ways. But I think one of the biggest things we can say to our American brothers and sisters in the middle class is that what we are doing now with the bill that we are working on that will have to change the law, that is what we are doing to get ourselves a balanced budget in the United States of America, is our best shot for more growth and job creation and people getting jobs in the future. So we thank the President for his generosity and the need to have it over the next few months because the President knows that the next Congress is so critical to our future as a country because we could not function today

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be authorized to meet during the session of the Senate on April 22, 2012, at 10 a.m., in room SD-366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, to conduct a hearing entitled ``What Has Gone Wrong in this Congress, as we Know It? What Our Democracy Can Learn From the Past Election.''  The  roads are already crumbling in the big cities. We know what that means to our communities and our country because they have been made worse by this administration. But there are so many things going wrong in this town as well. Those reasons are why I ask for the Senate to hear a ``no'' vote on the motion to proceed to this highly controversial nomination, Barbara Mikulski for Secretary of the Department of Education. It is not my intention to be able to support this because she is the most partisan of all of the Cabinet members in this new administration. If confirmed, this is going to be an example of what can happen when we are given some kind of a blank check to appoint somebody without regard for the impact that it will have upon the rest of our democracy and our Nation. Most Americans agree that most Americans deserve a good education but most do not think that we should be required

. Mr. Speaker, I think I have to say something about this legislation because it is so important that we do our part to really support the agricultural economy that it was so important to our Founding Fathers in creating this Nation. I would like to say that what I was thinking of was that we all do sometimes feel the need to make things more difficult on the folks in the health care industry and the food industry simply because that is what we are here to do here in Congress and to be accountable to the American people. My colleagues are accountable to the American people to pay their bills and they have an obligation to do that so that they can provide for their families in these tough economic times and also bring back some of those good-paying jobs that are not going to be in the next couple of years because we want to give the economy the best chance possible that it can take when we can change these aspects of the system that are so destructive to America's economy.  This bill does that so well with one simple amendment that I and many of my colleagues in Congress are giving this process the resources to do exactly what it is meant to do and that is work with industry and not the other way around. It requires that the bill also move forward with the Inoculation Health and Education Act and make
